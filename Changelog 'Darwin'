Changelog for 1.8.0 'Darwin'

General Science:
- Astronomers, engineers, naturalists, paleontologists, archaeologists, and anthropologists are now part of a category of characters we call "academics." Academics are not politicians, generals or admirals, but exist as background personalities.
- Since Academics do not exist as ordinary characters, they are generated over time via a special Journal Entry (Academic Career).
- The time it takes for a new academic to be generated depends on literacy levels, educational institutions, and specialized universities.
- The academic generated at the end of a curriculum is random; unless the player influences it by specializing universities. Then it is possible to specify the area from which the academic comes.
- Universities can be specialized. The areas are: technical-mathematical (astronomer, engineer), natural-historical (naturalist, paleontologist) and humanistic-anthropological (archaeologist, anthropologist).
- Several specialized universities do not give an additional bonus to an academic's doctoral degree; however, they do help to shape a particular research focus. For example, technical-mathematical universities give a bonus for researching production and military technologies, but a malus for society technologies.
- A nation that researches a certain key technology first receives an academic along with an event. Key technologies are: Modern Astronomy (Astronomer), Steel-Frame Building (Engineer), Evolutionary Theory (Naturalist), Paleontology (Paleontologist), Early Archaeology (Archaeologist), and Modern Archaeology (Anthropologist). In some cases, a nation gets historical characters for this; for example, Gustave Eiffel appears for France in the Engineering event.
- IMPORTANT: Archaeology has not yet been changed to the new system. For the time being, everything will remain the same. In an upcoming update, archaeologists will be generated via journal entry and anthropologists will be added as a new character trait. The Humanistic-Anthropological University is therefore still disabled in this update.

Zoology:
- 30 animals, 5 per continent, live in habitats designated by modifier.
- Naturalists can collect animals on their own territory by decision.
- With a diplomatic action, animals can be bought from friendly countries.
- Safari Decision to capture African animals.
- Animals can also be found on the Pacific Expedition and Zeppelin Expedition.
- From 5 animals you can build a zoo. This zoo can be upgraded by decision the more animals you have. The bigger the zoo, the more prestige. There are five upgrade levels (currently only four are possible).
- A zoo can either strengthen science as a research zoo or raise the standard of living as an entertainment zoo.
- The zoo can be entered via a journal entry. There you can find all captured animals that can be visited. Under certain circumstances there are also Easter Eggs.

Naturalism:
- Naturalist as a special trait belonging to an academic.
- Collect specimens on Pacific Expeditions, Safaris, and African Expeditions (Vanilla). 
- Via a Journal Entry, specimens can be used to build a botanical garden or specimen collection in your zoo. The garden improves living standards, the collection improves research; both give prestige.
- Your naturalist can discover the "Wallace" line on a Pacific expedition in Indonesia if you have enough specimens and advanced technologies.
- Historical events for the return of the Beagle with Darwin, the publication of Humboldt's "Cosmos" and the discovery of Mendel's rules.

Paleontology:
- Paleontologist as a special trait belonging to an academic.
- Several states have Normal and Great rock formations. However, these are not uncovered at first, but are discovered by paleontologists or revealed during research into paleontology technology.
- Normal formations contain fossils, while Great formations contain fossils and dinosaur bones.
- If you have a formation and a paleontologist, the paleontologist will find fossils every year (passively).
- Fossils can also be found on Pacific expeditions and the Zeppelin expedition.
- Game rule that allows to randomize Great Formations on a continent. Dinosaur bones are then not necessarily in the western United States, but can be anywhere in North America.
- Paleontological collection as part of the zoo. Accessible via Journal Entry to get more information.
- Special fossils such as the Java Man, trilobites, insects encased in amber, or Archaeopteryx.
- Java Man can be discovered on a Pacific expedition to Java if you have fossils and paleontology. This must happen before 1891. Otherwise, the Dutchman Dubois finds the bones by historical means.
- IMPORTANT: The paleontology feature is not finished yet. It still lacks dinosaur bones and the ability to assemble them into skeletons. Fossils can also be found, but do not yet have a more advanced feature.

Oceanography:
- Pacific expeditions with customized ship names.
- Pacific expeditions can increase a nation's oceanographic knowledge. Should a nation accumulate enough oceanographic knowledge, it gains a naval advantage for a few years.
- The Challenger Deep can be discovered during a Pacific expedition in Oceania, assuming sufficient oceanographic knowledge.
- Pacific expeditions designed to enhance a nation's glory have a chance to complete a circumnavigation.
- Admirals who undertake a successful Pacific expedition can improve their trait.

Astronomy:
- Observation of solar eclipses and southern starry skies during Pacific expeditions.
- Possibility to observe the transit of Venus in 1874 (major event).
- Discovery of the asteroid Astraea by Prussia (additional planet before the discovery of Neptune).
- Historical events about the observatories in Awadh, Athens and Switzerland.
- Numerous new characters with their own models available as astronomers: Le Verrier, Quetelet, Argelander, Vouris, Schiaparelli, Hubble, Bond, Wilcox, Wolf, Möbius, Planck.

Christian Mission in Oceania:
- Countries with diplomatic interests in Oceania may send missionaries to convert the natives.
- After successful conversion, the chiefs place themselves under the protectorate of their godfather. Protectorates can be annexed very easily via diplomatic action.
- Rival mission stations (Catholic vs. Protestant) can lead to a political crisis.
- Missions provide access to oceanic artifacts, exotic animals, and the opportunity to acquire colonies with "soft power".
- Unsuccessful missionaries are killed by natives.

Changes:
- Museums and observatories are no longer built by Decision. Instead, they are built directly like any other building (if the requirements are met).
- Museum, Observatory, Opera and Zoo are not accessible via a "Visit" Decision, but a Journal Entry (Visit Special Building).
- Removed character interaction with engineer. An engineer will automatically work on a monument without making him the construction manager.
- Archaeological Exhibitions are now worth more (15, 25, 50, 100 prestige).
- Astronomical report shows how many astronomical objects were found in the year.
- 5 new events for the vanilla Africa expeditions.
- Detailed listing and indexing of all events in the event files at the top of the file.

GFX:
- New images for Curtiss technologies.
- Icons for East Asian artifacts, Schneider Trophy points, Architectural Splendor and Airlines.
- Characters now don't always wear hats and glasses.
- Two new loading screens.
- New start screen.

Music:
- New playlist "Dubois - Carnival of the Animals" with 14 new tracks.
- New playlist "Elgar - National Themes". National themes have been extracted from the Dawn OST.
- New playlist "Elgar - War Themes". War themes are taken from the Morgenröte OST.
- New track "Gauillaume Tell" as national theme for Switzerland.

Fixes:
- Piccard now travels around as originally intended.
- Localization for two IG modifiers added.
- Localization for Sagrada-Decision corrected.
- Removed Capitalists from independent artist pm.
