Changelog for 2.2.2 "Ball"

Game Rules
- Academic at Game Start: You can chose that every nation with an university starts with a random academic or with no academics at all.

Changes
- Renamed Inorganic Chemistry to Organic&Inorganic Chemistry.
- Drastically reduced the number of countries starting with Organic&Inorganic Chemistry (57->25).
- To build an observatory, you need an university and either Modern Astronomy or Organic&Inorganic Chemistry.
- Astronomer and Chemists will offer to build an observatory if none exists yet.
- Smugglers get 5 points of infamy when they fail (instead of 10).
- Early Aviation, not Steel-frame buildings is needed for the Airship JE to trigger.
- Switzerland and Sweden start with Atmospheric Engine.
- Replaced some loading screens for more variety.

Geology
- Added Geology Tech.
- Natural History University available with Geology instead of Theory of Evolution.
- Added Minerals as a new object. Minerals will be found yearly in states with special state traits, like caves, mountains or special deposits. Arctic and desert traits add a little bit, too. Volcanoes and Great Geological Formation are the best, however.
- Minerals obtained at the end of a Pacific Expedition.

Chemistry
- Added Chemist as a new Academic.
- Chemists can theorize, discover and isolate elements, depending on your technologies, PMs and character traits/experience.
- Chemists need Minerals to discover or isolate elements.
- 15 Random Chemist Events theorizing, discovering or isolating an element.
- Added a button for Chemist to improve fertilizer. Chemists will improve Fertilizer Plants, giving modifiers for throughput, input and output.
- Added a button for Chemist to improve explosives. Chemists will improve Explosives Factories, giving modifiers for throughput, input and output.
- Added a button for Chemist to improve Synthetics. Chemists will improve Synthetic Fuel Factories and Synthetic Plants, giving modifiers for throughput, input and output.
- Added the possibility to arrange a Chemist Congress based on the Karlrsuhe Congress of 1860 to determine atomic weight.
- Chemists can research Synthetic Fuel and Synthetic Rubber (both are hidden techs).
- Added Synthetic Fuel Tech.
- Added Hydrogenation Plants Building (possible with Synthetic Fuel Tech).
- Added Synthetic Fuel Tech.
- Added Hydrogenation Plants Building (possible with Synthetic Fuel Tech).
- Added JE for the Noble Gases.
- Added JE for the Periodic Table.
- Removed Mendeleyev Event for Russia (you can do the Periodic Table on your own!).

Engineering
- Civil Engineers on Infrastructure Projects will no longer go to the nice unincorporated islands first and instead focus on incorporated states.
- You can now invest additional money to accelerate your civil engineering projects.

Fixes
- Devout scientists no longer wear their silly hats.
- An Academic that was retiriing and just got replaced will no longer cause the young academic to also retire.

Changelog for 2.2.3 "Miss Duce"

Geology
- Added Geologist
- Added a button for Geologists to find new ore veins. Geologists will give all mining buildings a modifier.

- Rare Minerals can be found on expeditions when a Geologist is present.
- 20,000 minerals can be exchanged for 1 rare mineral.
- With 50 rare minerals, a Mineral Cabinet can be added to the Zoo.

Pacific Expedition
- Geologist may go on Pacific Expeditions and get the Oceanographer or Geophysicist trait.
- Added 4 new Geologist Events for Pacific Expedition.

Mountaineering
- Geologist may go on Mountain Expedition and find minerals.
