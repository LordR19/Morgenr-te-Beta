Changelog for 2.1.4 "Bingham"

Archaeology:
- Added four new technologies: Egyptology, Assyriology, Aegean Archaeology, Pre-Columbian Archaeology.
- One of these techs can be chosen via JE to specialize a nation in one archaeological field.
- Techs can also be gained via archaeological milestones like Decipherment of Accadian gives Assyriology, Discovery of Machu Picchu Pre-Columbian Archaeology etc.
- Special technology gives +1 yearly artifacts for each excavation in the corresponding archaeological site.
- Added four new character traits for archaeologists: Egyptologist, Assyriologist, Aegean Archaoelogist, Pre-Columbian Archaeologist.
- Traits can be gained by doing expeditions in a certain archaeological region. After doing two expeditions to Egypt, there is a 50% chance that an archaeologist gets the Egyptologist trait. After three expeditions, he will get it automatically. This is true for every region/trait.
- New Archaeologists start with the corresponding trait, if they have one of the specialized technologies. E. g., a country with Egyptology will always generate new archaeologists with the egyptologist trait.
- Archaeologists can have several specialization traits.
- Archaeologists with a specialized trait will get +5 artifacts at the end of an expedition in the corresponding archaeological site, e. g. doing an expedition as an Assyriologist in Babylonia or Assyria.
- Archaoelogist with a specialized trait will get +1 clue when inspecting an excavation site in the corresponding archaeological site.
- Modern Archaeology tech gives +1 yearly artifact for each excavation.
- Changed artifacts at the end of an expedition: you should get some more artifacts than before.
