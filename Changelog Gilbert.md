Changelog for 2.2.4 "Gilbert"

Music:
- With the invention of Nationalism, it is possible to adopt National Anthems.
- Five categories of anthems with specific modifier: Monarch Anthem, Folk Anthem, Value Anthem, Military Anthem, Worker Anthem.
- If a country has no historical anthem it can adopt via event, it is still possible to adopt one later via decision.
- Composers may create music pieces by chance which may fit as national anthems later.
- Composers can be commissioned to compose a national anthem.
- National anthems can be adopted without lyrics, but national writers may write lyrics (which makes an anthem more prestigious).
- Some anthems may get outdated after political changes (monarch anthems will not be used anymore without monarch).
- Added many historical anthems via custom loc. Custom anthems are planned for the future.

Natural History:
- Levels of Natural History focused Universities now give a bonus on Breeding, Naturalist and Paleontologist Projects.
- Nature Reserves no longer cost money but don't give add any tourism income (pretend that they pay for themselves).

Fixes:
- Fixed missing Element Symbols
- Colonial Helmet Mesh fixed.
- Fixed various localization issues.
- Engineers now properly get their experience every year.
- Female Composers are now really no longer naked. (I hope, otherwise we might get another Reddit post about it...)
- Added a Tooltip for the improvement projects that were missing them.
- The National Park now properly adds a modifier again as well.
- The Interdisciplinary Symposium no longer requires a geologist who is a famous paleontologist but a paleontologist as it is intended.
