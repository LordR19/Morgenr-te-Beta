General:
- You can now promote a specific Academic.
- Universities with Mathematical-Technical Focus are available with Atmospheric Engine.
- Promoting an Astronomer needs Modern Astronomy.

Zoology:
- The event for the Zoo Inauguration gives 5 academic progress instead of a modifier.


Archaeology:
- Exhibitions are now production methods in the Archaeological Museum. 
- Exhibitions no longer have to be arranged; the upgrade from one exhibition size to the next takes place automatically when:
-- an archaeologist returns from an expedition
-- yearly excavation artifacts arrive
-- a major artifact is found
-- a great discovery is made.
- Options removed in the museum to arrange exhibitions or host an archaeological congress. All exhibition modifiers deleted. All exhibition events deleted. Archaeological Congress deleted.
- Removed Workforce from Archaeological Museum.
- No more "cascade effect" for events when preparing or visiting cities on archaeological expeditions. Events now only take place one after the other.
- Removed fast Archaeological Expeditions.
- Added instead the option to hire a "mysterious guide" who knows special places. This makes special events such as the pyramid puzzle, the sarcophagus of the Unknown Pharaoh and other narrative events much more likely. The probability of finding a "special clue" is also significantly increased.
- Added an event for the Museum Inauguration, which gives 5 academic progress.
