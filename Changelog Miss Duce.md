Changelog for 2.2.3 "Miss Duce"

Changes
- Paleontologists and Anthropologists will not discover formations/caves anymore. Geologists will do that instead.

Geology
- Added Geologist
- Added Geologist Traits: Mineralogist, Geophysicist, Volcanologist, Oceanographer, Prospector
- Added Seismology Tech
- Added Volcano Observatory building. Can be build in states with volcanoes. You need a Geologist to do that.
- Added a button for Geologists to find new ore veins. Geologists will give all mining buildings a modifier.
- Added a button for Geologists to find new oil wells. Geologists will give all oil rigs a modifier.
- Rare Minerals can be found on expeditions when a Geologist is present.
- 20,000 minerals can be exchanged for 1 rare mineral.
- With 50 rare minerals, a Mineral Cabinet can be added to the Zoo.
- Added a button to explore the Mid-Atlantic Ridge after it was detected by the Transatlantic Cable Expedition.
- Added a button to determine the Age of Earth. This can be done once in a life time of a geologist. Other nations have to accept the theory, however.
- Added a button for Geological Research. Geologists may discover Formations, Caves and Uranium. If a Geologist has the mineralogist trait, yearly minerals are doubled. If not, he may get the trait after five years.
- When doing Geological Research, Geologists may find meteorites, which can be analyzed by chemists. Added 5 historical giant meteorites.
- Added other random events for Geological Research.
- Oceanography JE also gives Geological Knowledge when completed.
- When Oceanography JE is completed, a second Oceanography JE will trigger, giving tech boost and geological knowledge when completed.
- First country that invents Seismology gets a free Geologist.
- Added Geological Congress on Plate Tectonics.
- Moved Journey to the Center of the Earth from Archaeology to Geology.
- Added 4 achievements.

Volcanology
- Added Volcanoes to Azores and Canaries.
- Reworked Volcano eruptions. Every ten years, one of three things may occur: volcano gets active (no devastation, possible science), volcano erupts (small, normal or mega eruption, giving also scientific benefits under circumstance) or nothing happens.
- Geologists can do Volcano expeditions in states with a volcano and Volcano Observatory. 25 random Events. A Geologist has to gain 18 progress in less than 2 years. If the Volcano Danger bar reaches 5, the expedition will end in catastrophe.
- Geologists may discover Helium when exploring a volcano.
- Geologists become volcanologists when succesfully exploring a volcano.
- After a succesful expedition, the Basic Volcanology PM in the Volcano Observatory will be elevated to Advanced Volcanology.

Characters
- Emil Erlenmeyer (random German Chemist)
- Louis Agassiz (random Swiss Geologist)

Pacific Expedition
- Geologist may go on Pacific Expeditions and get the Oceanographer or Geophysicist trait.
- Added 4 new Geologist Events for Pacific Expedition.

Mountaineering
- Geologist may go on Mountain Expedition and find minerals.
- Having a Geologist in your team will give you a better chance fo success for every mountain step.
- Having a Geologist will give you one free step if you have done at least 3 steps.
- Don't climb without your Geologist.

Astronomy
- Moon Mapping is an astronomer action/button now.
- Added a JE to find Meteorites. 10 Meteroites will give a large astronomical tech boost.

Fixes
- The Retirement of the Chemist no longer causes the Anthropologist to retire.
