Changelog for 2.2.3c "Miss Duce"

Paleontology
- New actions for Paleontologists: Systemize fossils. This is a theoretical work which will not need Geological Formations. Useful in early game.
- New action for Paleontologists: Prehistoric Scenery. Paleontologists may create a Prehistoric Scenery in a University, giving a small modifier (innovation/pop qualification) to the University when ready.
- Three Prehistoric Sceneries are possible.

Safari
- Safari only needs a new Zoo, not a small Zoo to be available.
- Safari takes 300 days.
- Safari JE will show you what trapping/tracking values are needed when hunting a specific animal.
- Animals may escape or attack.
- Safari may end prematurely when an animal destroys traps after attack.
- Naturalists with the Zoologist trait will outsmart escaping or attacking animals.
- Machine Guns and Combustion engine will not only give trapping and tracking bonus, but also prevent animals from attacking or escaping.
- JE will be inactivated if Naturalist dies.
