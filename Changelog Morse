Engineering
- All Engineer Types can research technologies in their area of expertise
- Civil Engineers can be focused on a project to improve the infrastructure of your country or to improve your construction sectors.
- Mechanical Engineers can focus on a project to develop new locomotives which improve your railway buildings or a project to improve your industrial and ressource buildings
- Military Engineers can focus on a project to unlock new mobilization options.
- Electrical Engineers may join the Magnetic Association and build a Geomagnetic Observatory (PM). 
- All Geomagnetic Observatories will send magnetic data to Göttingen. If there are enough observatories and enough data, all member states will get a tech boost.
- Hannover (Göttingen) starts with a Geomagnetic Observatory.
- Iron, lead and oil deposits may be found via magnetic data, giving mines and oil rigs additional trhoughput (one time event for each).
- Electrical Engineers may build a Telegraphy Network, activating the Telegraphy Office PM in Railways.
- Electrical Engineers may build Radio Stations, activating the Radio Station PM in Railways.
- Added Transatlantic Cable JE and Transatlantic Transmission JE.
- Added some random events when building Geomagnetic Observatory, Telegraphy Offices or Radio Stations.
- First Nations that invents Electric Telegraph gets an Engineer. If the USA invents Electric Telegraph first, they get Samuel Morse.
- Aeronautical Engineers can focus on a project to unlock new mobilization options or a project to improve your airports.

Changes
- Magnetic Data may be collected on Pacific Expeditions (Magnetism and Anatarctica Events).
- Moved Radio Stations PM from urban Center to Railway.
- Electric Telegraph is now an era 2 technology (instead era 3).
- Reduced the diplo cost drastically for Excavation License, Paleontological License, Botanical License, Mountaineering License and Airspace to 5.

Fixes
- Children might like to play with balloons, but they should no longer become balloonists at birth.
- Secessionist countries will no longer be in the top ten of the best countries, just because they inherited musical tradition and astronomical objects from their opressors.
- Additional Funding for scientists will no longer cost a fortune and throw smaller countries into dept.
- The AI now only throws money at scientists when they ask, if it actually has enough money.
- The Morgenröte Mobilization Options should now have better matching colors.
- Wait, that's a Sealion? I thought it was a Zebra! Why did the Tooltip say it's a Zebra then?
