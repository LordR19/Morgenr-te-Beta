Culture
- Added Spitzweg-Event for Bavaria.

Characters
- Louis Renault (random French Engineer)
- Guglielmo Marconi (random Italian Engineer)
- Samuel Morse (random American Engineer)

Engineering
- Electrical Engineers may join the Magnetic Association and build a Geomagnetic Observatory (PM). 
- All Geomagnetic Observatories will send magnetic data to Göttingen. If there are enough observatories and enough data, all member states will get a tech boost.
- Hannover (Göttingen) starts with a Geomagnetic Observatory.
- Iron, lead and oil deposits may be found via magnetic data, giving mines and oil rigs additional trhoughput (one time event for each).
- Electrical Engineers may build a Telegraphy Network, activating the Telegraphy Office PM in Railways.
- Electrical Engineers may build Radio Stations, activating the Radio Station PM in Railways.
- Added Transatlantic Cable JE and Transatlantic Transmission JE.
- Added some random events when building Geomagnetic Observatory, Telegraphy Offices or Radio Stations.
- First Nations that invents Electric Telegraph gets an Engineer. If the USA invents Electric Telegraph first, they get Samuel Morse.

Changes
- Magnetic Data may be collected on Pacific Expeditions (Magnetism and Anatarctica Events).
- Moved Radio Stations PM from urban Center to Railway.
- Electric Telegraph is now an era 2 technology (instead era 3).

Fixes
- Children might like to play with balloons, but they should no longer become balloonists at birth.
