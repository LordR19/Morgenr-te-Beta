Changelog for 2.2.0 "Saint-Exupery"

Characters:
- Thomas Mann (random German Writer)
- Joseph von Eichendorff (German Writer)
- Robert Louis Stevenson (random Scottish Writer)
- Alexander Pushkin (Russian Writer)

Changes:

Aviation:
- Pilots will be generated after a battle is won if one of the mobilization options of the army includes an aircraft mobilization (zeppelins and balloons excluded). This will happen always, not randomly.
- New Action for Pilots: Air Combat.
- Added Air Combat JE and several events for air combat.
- In Air Combat, Pilots will passively gain kills/aerial victories per month. For each kill, they gain 5 experience. This depends on traits, experience and luck.
- Pilots may gain traits like cautious, brave or persistent in air combat events, but may also be wounded and traumatized. (Remember that pilot traits have an effect on the Schneider Trophy Points!)
- Airline Tycoon works like other void characters.
- Adjusted modifiers which gave too much negative/positive IG approval.
- Zeppelin Expedition no longer needs access to the Arctic or Airspace Convention.
- Raised max. supply share of Air Travels from 5% to 10%.
- Air Travel can become a leisure good.
- Drastically changed Airline Size which is needed for Airline Level (Flight Routes needed for max. Level 6 was 15, now it is only 10).
- Giant Zeppelin (Hindenburg) is not a JE anymore; instead, the Aeronaticaul Engineer builds it.
- Giant Airplane (Spruce Goose) is not a JE anymore; instead, the Aeronaticaul Engineer builds it.
- The calculation of whether the Giant Airplane flies or not has been fundamentally revised. The chance now depends primarily on the experience of your aircraft engineer and the characteristics of your pilot. If you decide to recreate the historical “Spruce Goose” when making construction decisions, this will still have an advantage in the calculation.

Fixes:
- Countries should no longer gain massive amounts of prestige from too many modifiers.
