Changelog for 2.2.0 "Saint-Exupery"

Characters:

Changes:

Aviation:
- Airline Tycoon works like other void characters.
- Adjusted modifiers which gave too much negative/positive IG approval.
- Zeppelin Expedition no longer needs access to the Arctic or Airspace Convention.
- Raised max. supply share of Air Travels from 5% to 10%.
- Air Travel can become a leisure good.
- Drastically changed Airline Size which is needed for Airline Level (Flight Routes needed for max. Level 6 was 15, now it is only 10).
- Giant Zeppelin (Hindenburg) is not a JE anymore; instead, the Aeronaticaul Engineer builds it.
- Giant Airplane (Spruce Goose) is not a JE anymore; instead, the Aeronaticaul Engineer builds it.
- The calculation of whether the Giant Airplane flies or not has been fundamentally revised. The chance now depends primarily on the experience of your aircraft engineer and the characteristics of your pilot. If you decide to recreate the historical “Spruce Goose” when making construction decisions, this will still have an advantage in the calculation.
