Changelog for 2.2.0 "Cook"

Tourism
- Added Tourism tech (+1 Company Slots)
- Researching the Tourism Technology gives a modifier with Tourism income.
- Tourism Income depends on Monuments, Museums, Art Galeries, Centers of CUlture, Cultural Tradition and other fancy Morgenr√∂te stuff. Airports heavily increase tourism income. Laws like laissez-faire and free market help, isolationism ... not so much.

Changes
- PBI events should now occur less frequently.
- "Laughed at the Astronomical Congress"-Modifier gives -25 prestige instead of -50 prestige.
- It is possible to inspect an excavation site after 2 years (instead of 3 years) when searching for clues.
