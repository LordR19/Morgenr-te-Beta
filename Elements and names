###	List of misindentified elements (chronological order):

-Didymium (1841) Praseodymium and neodymium
-Pelopium (1846) Niobium and tantalum
-Ilmenium (1847) Niobium and tantalum
-Dianium (1860) Niobium and tantalum
-Wasium (1862) Mixture of rare earths
-Nebulium (1864) Oxygen O2+ ion
-Coronium (1869) Ionised Iron
-Davyum (1877) Iridium and rhodium
-Decipium (1878) Samarium and other rare earths
-Austrium (1886) Gallium
-Gnomium (1892) Hypothised with error due to similarities to nickel and iron, hypothesis later explained with atomic nums theory
-Lucium (1896) Yttrium
-Victorium and Monium (1897) Gadolinium and terbium
-Berzelium and Carolinium (1901) Thorium
-Nipponium (1908) Rhenium (discoverer thought he found Technetium, still a new element, but wrong atomic number)
-Neutronium (1926) element 0

###	Proposed names and controversy for some theorised elements:

- Columbium/Niobium (41)
- Ytterbium/Aldebaranium (70)
- Lutetium/Cassiopeium (71)
- Wolfram/Tungsten (74)
- Astatitine/Alabamium (85)
- Radon/Niton (86)
- Thorium/Ionium (90)

#Theorised names from Mendeleev's first work 1869:

- Eka-boron (Sc 21) later discovered as Scandium
- Eka-aluminium (Ga 31) later discovered as Gallium
- Eka-manganese (Tc 43) later discovered as Technetium
- Eka-silicon (Ge 32) later discovered as Germanium

He predicted an heavier element under Titanium (22) and Zirconium (40), and put element Lanthanum (58) instead of the actual element Hafnium (72), discovered in 1923

#Second update in 1871

- Dvi-manganese (Re 75) later discovered as Rhenium
- Dvi-tellurium (Po 84) later discovered as Polonium
- Dvi-caesium (Fr 87) later discovered as Francium
- Eka-tantalum (Pa 91) later discovered as Proactinium

#After 1904, with atomic number measurement theory, elements 43 (Technetium), 61 (Promethium), 72 (Hafnium), 75 (Rhenium), 85 (Astatine), and 87 (Francium) where theorised and discovered noticing holes in the periodic table suggesting their existance.
