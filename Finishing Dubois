#Features that "Dubois" are still missing:

#Paleontology
#- Paleontology window with found fossils, dinosaur bones, assembled skeletons and a panel for the paleontologist.
#- Large rock formation events where dinosaur bones can be found.
#- A skeleton can be reconstructed from three dinosaur bones.
#- Dinosaurs differ depending on the continent, which means that you will not find the same rock formations in European rock formations as in Asian or African ones.
#- 20 fossils can be converted into a missing dinosaur bone. This is only possible if you have at least one dinosaur bone; No dinosaur can be reconstructed ex nihilo.
#- Special fossils like Neanderthal, Taung Child, Archeopteryx
#- Fossil collection must give prestige and research points

#Zoo
#- Baby animals for the zoo
#- Breeding and reintroduction of bison
#- Other animals: zebra, lemur, naked mole rat (Africa), snow leopard (Asia), caribbean manatee (South America)

#Assignments
#Powerful interest groups or interest groups in the government should (similar to the government petitions) confront the player with orders. 
#These are ultimate but have a generous time frame (15 years). They should increase the reputation of a nation. Examples of such orders are:
#- A large archaeological exhibition (the type will be determined randomly in the event).
#- A random exotic animal.
#- A certain zoo size should be reached.
#- A missionary should set up a missionary station in Oceania (Devout!).
#- Musical tradition should be raised to a certain value.
#- A certain number of astronomical objects should be discovered in a certain period of time.
#- A dinosaur skeleton is to be assembled (if the nation does not already have one).
#- A university with a specific focus is to be set up and a suitable academic expanded.
#The Journal Entry has a timer. When this expires, there are bad relationships and a negative modifier. Should the order be completed beforehand, there is a positive modifier and good relationships. Only one order at a time should be possible.
