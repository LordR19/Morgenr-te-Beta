They feared the spirits and sought their aid; especially seeking to propitiate those who presided over war and peace, famine and plenty, health and sickness, destruction and prosperity, life and death.

The excitement from the novelty of objects, and the chance of success, stimulate him to increased activity. Moreover as a number of isolated facts soon become uninteresting, the habit of comparison leads to generalization. On the other hand, as the traveller stays but a short space of time in each place, his descriptions must generally consist of mere sketches, instead of detailed observation.

The oldest known fossils are mostly stromatolites, and they could therefore provide clues as to how life evolved from very simple to more complex forms. Stromatolites are considered to be the first recognizable structures built up by organisms. They originated in the Precambrian, up to 3.5 billion years ago. 3.45 billion years old is the Warrawoona series, found at the North Pole site in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. In some periods of the earth's history - long before corals existed - the stromatolite builders were important reef builders. Up until a billion years ago, stromatolites were widespread in almost all coastal waters. 700 million years ago, the diversity and distribution of stromatolites declined.

The finds from Java were first referred to as Anthropopithecus and later as Pithecanthropus erectus. Today they are assigned to the species Homo erectus by most paleoanthropologists, whereby their origin is occasionally - as suggested by Franz Weidenreich in 1940 - emphasized by the addition of a subspecies epithet: Homo erectus javanensis.

Several arrows hit [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] and [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] slumped down lifeless." #NT!
