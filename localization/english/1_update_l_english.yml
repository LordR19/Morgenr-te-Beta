 concept_curtiss_tourism: "[concept_curtiss_tourism] provides a culturally superior nation with additional income. Unique monuments, museums and art galleries, archaeological sites, centers of art as well as high values ​​in the various cultural traditions are factors that make a nation an attractive tourist destination. Laws that increase freedom of movement and economic activity also contribute to higher tourism income. The infrastructure also plays a crucial role - after all, remote places cannot be reached. An airport in particular revolutionizes tourism and provides a significant increase in revenue."
