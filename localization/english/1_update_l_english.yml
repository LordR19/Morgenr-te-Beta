 dubois.1019.f2: "\"Meerkats are expert diggers,\" the zookeeper shares. \"They can dig multiple feet deep in just minutes, which is essential for finding food like insects, small reptiles, and roots.

These underground networks provide protection from predators and extreme weather.\"" #created with ChatGPT
 dubois.1019.f3: "\"Meerkats have a wide range of vocalizations,\" the zookeeper explains. \"Their sounds include everything from alarm calls to coordinate their movements, to softer calls used to maintain contact within the group.

 dubois.1030.d: "The Pallas's Cat enclosure was a rocky terrain dotted with crevices and small caves. At first glance, the thick, fluffy feline seemed almost invisible, perfectly blending in with its surroundings. Then, you spotted one—its round, wide eyes peeking out cautiously from behind a boulder, quietly observing everything around it." #created with ChatGPT
 dubois.1030.f1: "In the rocky enclosure of the zoo, the Pallas's Cat peers out from behind a boulder, its wide, round eyes scanning the surroundings. With its thick, silvery fur puffed up against the cold, it looks like a small, wild ball of fluff. Unlike many other wild cats, the Pallas's Cat has a stocky build and short legs, perfectly adapted to the cold, high-altitude regions of Central Asia where it lives." #created with ChatGPT
 dubois.1030.f2: "As the Pallas's Cat emerges from its hiding place among the rocks, its flat face and large, expressive eyes give it an almost comical appearance. Visitors are often surprised by its small size and fluffy fur, which help it blend into its snowy surroundings. Solitary by nature, the Pallas's Cat is rarely seen in the wild, preferring to stay hidden in rock crevices and burrows during the day and emerging at dawn or dusk to hunt." #created with ChatGPT
 dubois.1030.f3: "Amidst the chilly, simulated steppe environment of its enclosure, the Pallas's Cat moves with quiet precision, its thick tail trailing behind like a plume. Known for its elusive behavior, this small wild cat prefers solitude and relies on its camouflaging fur to avoid detection by both predators and prey.

Visitors, entranced by its otherworldly presence, gather to observe this rare creature. Curious about its origins, you approach a zookeeper for more information." #created with ChatGPT
 dubois.1039.f1: "\"The Thylacine, or Tasmanian Tiger, is a fascinating example of convergent evolution,\" the zookeeper explains. \"Although it looks like a canine with its dog-like body and striped coat, it is actually a marsupial, more closely related to kangaroos and koalas. Native to Tasmania and mainland Australia, the Thylacine was once the apex predator of its environment. Its distinct stripes helped it blend into the dense forests and grasslands where it hunted.\"" #created with ChatGPT
 dubois.1039.f2: "\"Thylacines were primarily nocturnal hunters,\" the zookeeper shares. \"They relied on their keen sense of sight and hearing to track down prey, often hunting alone or in pairs. Unlike many other predators, Thylacines were relatively silent, using stealth and patience to approach their quarry. Their diet consisted mainly of small to medium-sized animals, including wallabies, birds, and rodents.\"" #created with ChatGPT
 dubois.1039.f3: "\"The Thylacine's vocalizations were rare but memorable,\" the zookeeper explains. \"They would produce a series of yips, growls, and howls, especially during the breeding season or when feeling threatened. These calls were used to communicate with other Thylacines over long distances, particularly in the dense forests of Tasmania. Though their vocal range was not as varied as some other predators, the Thylacine's calls were an essential part of its behavior, adding to its mystique.\"" #created with ChatGPT

Curious about its impressive antlers, you approach a zookeeper for more information.\n\"European Elk, or Moose as they are known in North America, are the largest members of the deer family,\" the zookeeper explains. \"Their antlers can span up to six feet across and are used primarily during the rutting season, when males compete for mates.

 panum.301.d: "According to the latest reports, smallpox disease is now also rampant in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]. Our efforts to stop the epidemic have been unsuccessful."
 panum.301.g: "Smallpox everywhere!"
 panum.302.t: "Smallpox epidemic reaches [SCOPE.sCountry('panum_infected_country').GetName]"
 panum.302.d: "We have received reports that the first cases of smallpox were reported in [SCOPE.sCountry('panum_infected_country').GetName] today. The authorities blame us for not doing enough to prevent the spread."
 panum.302.g: "Who could have guessed that...?"
 panum.303.t: "Smallpox out of control"
 panum.303.d: "The healthcare system in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] has been brought to the brink of collapse. Doctors are already leaving the area because they themselves are at risk of becoming infected. Unfortunately, we have to adjust the death toll in the region upwards."
 panum.303.f: "'No attempt has been made to count the victims, nor is it possible to reckon them in any of these tribes with accuracy; it is believed that if the number 17,200 for the upper Missouri River Indians was doubled, the aggregate would not be too large for those who have fallen east of the Rocky Mountains.'"
 panum.303.g: "Is there no cure for this terrible illness?"

 panum.401.t: "Typhus spreads to [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]"
 panum.401.d: "The dangerous typhus has apparently spread to another state. Reports from [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] suggest that more and more people are falling victim to the disease."
 panum.401.g: "Typhus seems unstoppable ..."
 panum.402.t: "A Disease of Moral Corruption?"
 panum.402.d: "Given the limited knowledge of what typhus is, what causes it and how to effectively combat it, there are numerous theories as to what promotes infection. The prevailing view is that it is a disease related to lifestyle, not transmission."
 panum.402.f: "Similar to tuberculosis, there were many doctors who assumed that typhus was not a contagious disease. While tuberculosis was viewed in an almost romanticized way - it was a disease of the romantics and therefore 'noble' spirits - in the case of typhus the sickness was seen as a stigma of moral disrepute. The fact that the higher classes were not affected led to a certain feeling of superiority. Just as in the Middle Ages illnesses were often attributed to divine influence or punishment, it seemed to be a proven fact that character defects or depravity were to some extent linked to certain illnesses. It was only from the second third of the 19th century onwards that this view began to change."
 panum.402.g: "There is a reason why typhus primarily affects criminals, prostitutes and immoral soldiers."
 panum.402.h: "It probably matters less what these people are than where they live."
 panum.403.t: "Quarantine"
 panum.403.d: "There is a desire, particularly on the part of the middle and upper classes, to provide the lower social classes affected by typhus with their own facilities. These 'fever houses' would also be paid for by non-profit organizations. However, some representatives of the poorer classes see this as more of a method of exclusion than of health care. Some members of the government, on the other hand, want a complete quarantine, which the middle class in particular considers to be a completely excessive measure."
 panum.403.f: "Like many other epidemics, typhus served to segregate. The call for a general quarantine was therefore unpopular in many places because it was believed that certain people could be attributed to illness, especially since many believed it to be hereditary. However, the underlying fear of infection played a role, which is why fever houses were built in many places. During the great typhus epidemic in North America in 1847, the idea that it was a contagious disease became so widespread that masses of infected Irish immigrants were de facto deported to such institutions."
 panum.403.g: "The whole area should be quarantined."
 panum.403.h: "Take the typhus sufferers to special houses."
 panum.403.i: "Typhus is not a contagious disease, so quarantine makes no sense."
 panum.404.t: "Filthy Sheds"
 panum.404.d: "The situation in the alleged fever houses, which are increasingly turning into overcrowded coffins full of feces and misery, has already become a serious problem in the [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]. Pastors and sick carers have written a letter calling for these terrible houses to be dismantled."
 panum.404.f: "Fever sheds were filthy and crowded, with patients lying in double tiers of bunks which allowed dirt from the top bunk to fall onto the lower. According to the Senate Committee's report, two or three invalids would be placed together in one berth, irrespective of age or sex. There was no bread: meals consisted of tea, gruel or broth served three times a day. As drinking water was carted, there was never enough for the fever patients. One Catholic priest, Father Moylan, reported giving water to invalids in a tent who had not been able to drink for 18 hours. The sheds were not originally intended to house fever patients and had no ventilation; new sheds were built without privies. The Senate Committee stated that because of the lack of personnel and space, the invalids lay in their own excrement for days and there were insufficient staff to take away those who died during the night."
 panum.404.g: "We can't risk more people becoming infected."
 panum.404.h: "Improve the situation of typhus sufferers and provide medical help."
 panum.404.i: "Dismantle these inhumane houses!"
 panum.405.t: "Riots against Fever Sheds"
 panum.405.d: "The fear of typhus spreading in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] has radicalized some citizens to the extent that they have formed an angry mob. There is a rumor going around that they want to push the fever houses and their patients into the nearest river!"
 panum.405.f: "In 1847, the number of sheds in Montreal would grow to 22, with troops cordoning off the area so the sick could not escape. When a mob threatened to throw the fever sheds into the river, Montreal mayor John Easton Mills quelled the riot and provided care, giving patients water and changing bedding. He died in November, serving less than a year in office."
 panum.405.g: "This barbarism has no place in our country!"
 panum.405.h: "They die either way."
 panum.406.t: "Unburied Corpses"
 panum.406.d: "The number of deaths in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] is rising so rapidly that the undertakers can hardly keep up with the number. There is a danger that the unburied bodies could lead to even greater problems."
 panum.406.f: "In the 1860s, exceptionally harsh weather conditions and crop losses afflicted what was then the Grand Duchy of Finland, leading to famine and epidemic disease. 1866–68 saw hunger and especially what was thought of at the time as typhus killing 270,000 people in the region."
 panum.406.g: "Use all available means to prevent this problem from becoming overwhelming."
 panum.406.h: "Dig the usual mass graves."
 panum.406.i: "Our capacities are exhausted, you have to arrange things yourself!"
 panum.407.t: "Typhus in Barracks"
 panum.407.d: "Typhus is currently primarily contaminating [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]'s military facilities. It takes its deadly toll there."
 panum.407.f: "Many historians believe that the typhus outbreak among Napoleon's troops is the real reason why he stalled his military campaign into Russia, rather than starvation or the cold. Typhus was a significant killer during the American Civil War, although typhoid fever was the more prevalent cause of US Civil War 'camp fever'. As many as 900,000 deaths have been attributed to the typhus fever during the Crimean War in 1853-1856. Typhus was endemic in Poland and several neighboring countries prior to World War I (1914-1918), but became epidemic during the war. Typhus ravaged the armies of the Eastern Front, where over 150,000 died in Serbia alone. Fatalities were generally between 10% and 40% of those infected and the disease was a major cause of death for those nursing the sick."
 panum.407.g: "An invisible enemy deadlier than any army..."
 panum.408.t: "Tormented in Illness, not in War"
 panum.408.d: "The typhus epidemic in our barracks continues to spread every day. Soldiers are now among the most frequently killed in the [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] - and without enemy influence."
 panum.408.f: "'War is not an adventure. It is a disease. It is like typhus.' Antoine de Saint-Exupéry"
 panum.408.g: "Terrible!"

 panum.501.t: "Yellow Fever spreads to [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]"
 panum.501.d: "Reports of new cases of yellow fever have confirmed our worst fears. The disease is now also raging in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]!"
 panum.501.g: "Why wasn't it possible to stop this?"
 panum.502.t: "A contagious disease?"
 panum.502.d: "Although it is not clear whether yellow fever is a contagious disease or has other causes, many safety-minded citizens are calling for quarantine to stop the spread. If we don't do this, they could see it as ignorance or disinterest in their needs."
 panum.502.f: "The first outbreaks of yellow fever in the 17th century caused panic and disorientation. Even in the 18th century, people largely disagreed about what triggered an infection. Although governments and individuals resorted to strict measures or prevention, there was no success. The fear of yellow fever meant that no opportunity was wasted to prevent its further spread, sometimes with experimental or draconian measures. Some actions could therefore have psychological rather than medical reasons in order to avoid escalating the discontent among the population."
 panum.502.g: "There is no evidence that this is a contagious disease."
 panum.503.t: "Yellow Fever affects Plantations"
 panum.503.d: "Reports are received daily that the plantations in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] in particular have a high rate of yellow fever sufferers. Some government advisors are pushing to stop work there completely to reduce the spread."
 panum.503.f: "'A poor black man, named Sampson, went constantly from house to house where distress was, and no assistance, without fee or reward. He was smitten with the disorder, and died. After his death his family were neglected by those he had served. Sarah Bass, a poor black widow, gave all the assistance she could, in several families, for which she did not receive any thing; and when any thing was offered her, she left it to the option of those she served.' -Richard Allen"
 panum.503.g: "Get the workers out of the fields!"
 panum.503.h: "The plantation must continue to run, at all costs!"
 panum.504.t: "Evacuation"
 panum.504.d: "The health situation in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] continues to worsen. Members of the local government and administration have asked to leave the city and organize administration from the countryside. Some consider it a clever suggestion, others consider it sheer cowardice."
 panum.504.f: "During the 1793 Yellow Fever epidemic in Philadelphia, 5,000 or more people were listed in the register of deaths between August 1 and November 9. The vast majority of them died of yellow fever, making the epidemic in the city of 50,000 people one of the most severe in United States history. By the end of September, 20,000 people had fled the city, including congressional and executive officials of the federal government. Most did not return until after the epidemic had abated in late November. President George Washington left the city for his Mount Vernon estate. The mortality rate peaked in October before frost finally killed the mosquitoes and brought an end to the outbreak. Some neighboring towns refused to let refugees in from Philadelphia, fearing that they were carrying the fever. Major port cities, including those in Baltimore and New York City had quarantines against refugees and goods from Philadelphia, although New York City sent financial aid to Philadelphia."
 panum.504.g: "Evacuate the authorities."
 panum.504.h: "The local administration must not collapse."
 panum.505.t: "Yellow Fever spreads to Barracks"
 panum.505.d: "Yellow fever is currently primarily contaminating [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]'s military facilities. It takes its deadly toll there."
 panum.505.f: "For the rebels in Haiti at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and in Cuba almost 100 years later, yellow fever was the great ally against the colonial armies sent from Europe. The leader of the Cuban independence struggle spoke of his 'invincible generals June, July, August' - those months in which the rains come and with them the mosquitoes. The British had similar experiences during the siege of Cartagena in 1741. 29,000 British soldiers besieged the fortress. When the rains began, 22,000 perished miserably within a few weeks. The mortality rate in British garrisons in Jamaica was seven times that of garrisons in Canada, mostly because of yellow fever and other tropical diseases."
 panum.505.g: "No! They were destined for an honorable death on the battlefield!"
 panum.506.t: "Sailor's sickness"
 panum.506.d: "Port operations in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] have come to a virtual standstill due to yellow fever. On the one hand, many dock workers and seafarers are sick. On the other hand, as many ships as possible try to avoid the cursed region."
 panum.506.f: "'The most deplorable havoc is being made in New Orleans by the yellow fever. Thousands have been carried off by its ravages, and every day adds 200 more to the ghastly record. The dead are buried in trenches by chain gangs of negroes, hired at a guinea an hour. And thus, what with the songs and the obscene jests of the gravediggers, the buzzing of the flies, the sing-song cries of the huxter-women vending their confections, the hoarse oaths of the men who drive the dead carts, the merry whistle of the boys, and the stifling reek from the scores of blackened corpses, the day wears apace, the work of sepulture is done, and night draws the curtain. In the meantime, amusements, regattas, balls, &c. are preceding as usual, as if no such appalling pestilence was in the doomed city.' -Cambridge Weekly News in 1853"
 panum.506.g: "A collapse for shipping!"
 panum.507.t: "Black Vomit"
 panum.507.d: "In [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName], yellow fever is striking more violently than expected. Doctors report that more people than before have died from the disease."
 panum.507.f: "'Those who ventured abroad, had handkerchiefs or sponges impregnated with vinegar of camphor at their noses, or smelling-bottles full of the thieves' vinegar. Others carried pieces of tarred rope in their hands or pockets, or camphor bags tied round their necks... People hastily shifted their course at the sight of a hearse coming towards them. Many never walked on the footpath, but went into the middle of the streets, to avoid being infected in passing by houses wherein people had died. Acquaintances and friends avoided each other in the streets, and only signified their regard by a cold nod. The old custom of shaking hands fell in such general disuse, that many shrunk back with affright at even the offer of a hand. A person with mourning crepe, or any appearance of mourning, was shunned like a viper.'' -Mathew Carey"
 panum.507.g: "When will we finally be freed from this plague?"
