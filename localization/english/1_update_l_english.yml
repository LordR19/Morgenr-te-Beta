### Nationalization ###

 je_nationalization_italianization: "Italianization"
 je_nationalization_italianization_reason: "After the unification of Italy, Massimo d'Azeglio said that 'We have made Italy, now we must make Italians'. Even if the saying is historically questionable, it still brings to the point the truth that after Italy's political unification, internal unity was anything but stable. This doesn't just apply to the south, where the brigands were up to mischief - even in the north, outside of the bourgeois elite, most people still felt connected to their regional identity. Joint wars, high prestige, the construction of national institutions such as universities, art academies or administrative facilities are likely to ensure that a significantly stronger all-Italian identity emerges from the arduous process of national unity in the next few years."
 je_nationalization_italianization_goal: "#O National Identity Progress#! reaches #G 250#!."

 je_nationalization_germanization_reason: "After the founding of the German Empire in 1871, the Germans' sense of unity was already very widespread in the various federal states. The urgent need to unify the German states had existed since 1848. Only in Bavaria did a specific regional feeling prevail until well into the 20th century, but this was increasingly pushed back. Joint wars, high prestige, the construction of national institutions such as universities, art academies or administrative facilities are likely to ensure that a significantly stronger all-German identity emerges from the arduous process of national unity in the next few years." #Please replace
