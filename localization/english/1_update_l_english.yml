 curtiss_airplane_speed_record_modifier: "Airplane Speed Record"

 je_curtiss_testplane_build: "Test Aircraft Construction"
 je_curtiss_testplane_build_reason: "The capabilities of a test aircraft depend primarily on the experience of an aeronautical engineer and the technologies researched. Technologies that have a critical impact on aircraft capabilities include #O Modern Physics#!, #O Arc Welding#!, #O Seaplanes#! and #O Modern Aviation#!. In order to get the most out of an aircraft, you need a pilot whose experience also has a direct influence on the maximum speed."
 je_elgar_composer_conducting_goal: "Building a new aircraft takes about a year."

 curtiss.60.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_cook_scope').GetFullName] founded our country's first tourism company and is therefore considered to have laid the foundations for the local industry. The income is minimal, but the more interesting a country is, the more guests it can hope for."
 curtiss.60.f: "Tourism provides a culturally superior nation with additional income. Unique monuments, museums and art galleries, archaeological sites, centers of art as well as high values in the various cultural traditions are factors that make a nation an attractive tourist destination. Laws that increase freedom of movement and economic activity also contribute to higher tourism income. The infrastructure also plays a crucial role - after all, remote places cannot be reached. An airport in particular revolutionizes tourism and provides a significant increase in revenue."
 curtiss.60.g: "Tourists pay for art and culture?"
