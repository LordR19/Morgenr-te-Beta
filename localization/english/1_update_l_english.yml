Isolated from the outside world in order to spend time alone with the Lidenbrock diary. As [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_journey_coe_leader').GetSheHe] was to tell us later, there was one passage that had intrigued [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_journey_coe_leader').GetHerHim] for months. In addition to personal notes, a much older manuscript page was found between the pages. Creator: a 16th-century Icelandic alchemist named Arne Saknussemm. He left a mysterious inscription on runes that turned out to be more difficult to crack than [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_journey_coe_leader').GetFullName] first thought. Then, as if by intuition, [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_journey_coe_leader').GetSheHe] solved the riddle. As it turned out, [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_journey_coe_leader').GetSheHe] was right. The book had a secret; a mystery so great and monstrous that it shook [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_journey_coe_leader').GetHerHim] to the core. Because the alchemist's message was: \n\n 'Go down into the crater of Snaefells Jökull, which Scartaris's shadow caresses just before the calends of July, O daring traveler, and you'll make it to the center of the earth. I've done that.' \n\n What got [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_journey_coe_leader').GetFullName] even more excited: Lidenbrock had added new runes to the text with his own handwriting. They were: 'And me too.' For the Lead Scientist it is clear that these sensational statements require scientific verification.
