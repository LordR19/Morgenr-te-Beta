 dubois_nature_protection_tech_desc: "Nature Protection started with the need to protect forests. Later, endangered animal species and entire areas of land were also protected. In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were various successful nature conservation projects, such as the reintroduction of the Alpine ibex in the Swiss Alps."

 je_lepsius_specialization: "Archaeological Specialization"
 je_lepsius_specialization_reason: "A nation can choose an archaeological focus once. Depending on the archaeological subcategory, it receives one more artifact (Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Aegean, Pre-Columbian) per year for each excavation. New archaeologists receive the corresponding specialization trait and find 5 more artifacts at the end of the expedition."

 lepsius_specialization_egypt_button: "Egyptology"
 lepsius_specialization_egypt_button_desc: "Egyptology explores all areas of ancient Egyptian civilization (everyday life, language and literature, history, religion, culture and art, economics, law, ethics and intellectual life) from the prehistory of the 5th millennium BC. BC (for example the Negade and Badari cultures) until the end of Roman rule in the 4th century AD."

 lepsius_specialization_mesopotamia_button_desc: "Assyriology, also known as Cuneiform studies or Ancient Near East studies, is the archaeological, anthropological, historical, and linguistic study of the cultures that used cuneiform writing. The field covers Pre Dynastic Mesopotamia, Sumer, the early Sumero-Akkadian city-states, the Akkadian Empire, Ebla, the Akkadian and Imperial Aramaic speaking states of Assyria, Babylonia and the Sealand Dynasty, the migrant foreign dynasties of southern Mesopotamia, including the Gutians, Amorites, Kassites, Arameans, Suteans and Chaldeans.

 lepsius_specialization_aegean_button: "Aegean Archaeology"
 lepsius_specialization_aegean_button_desc: "Aegean civilization is a general term for the Bronze Age civilizations of Greece around the Aegean Sea. There are three distinct but communicating and interacting geographic regions covered by this term: Crete, the Cyclades and the Greek mainland. Crete is associated with the Minoan civilization from the Early Bronze Age. The Cycladic civilization converges with the mainland during the Early Helladic period and with Crete in the Middle Minoan period. From c. 1450 BC (Late Helladic, Late Minoan), the Greek Mycenaean civilization spreads to Crete, probably by military conquest."

 lepsius_specialization_precolumbian_button_desc: "In the history of the Americas, the pre-Columbian era spans from the original peopling of the Americas in the Upper Paleolithic to European colonization, which began with Christopher Columbus's voyage of 1492. Usually, the era covers the history of Indigenous cultures until significant influence by Europeans. This may have occurred decades or even centuries after Columbus for certain cultures."

 verrier.9010.d: "A professors at [SCOPE.sState('sound_of_science_state').GetCityHubName] University has demonstrated the the validity of #variable Christian Doppler#!'s theory that the observed frequency of sound or light changes if either the source or the observer is moving."
 verrier.9010.f: "A racing train, a blaring brass horn and a dozen perfect pitch ears have come together on the #bold #variable [SCOPE.sState('sound_of_science_state').GetFarmHubName]-[SCOPE.sState('sound_of_science_state').GetCityHubName]#!#! railway for an imaginative experiment. At stake? Doppler's theory on the movement of stars. For if the theory that the frequency of a wave changes with the speed of an object is correct, then a noticable drop in pitch from the blaring horn should be observed as the train races past the spectators.\nSelected for their ability to hear even a 1/8th difference in pitch, the spectators carefully record their observations as the train races by. Now; after 3 days of tabulation the results are in... And... Uniformly a drop in pitch is recorded!"
 verrier.9010.g: "Observation and experimentation is the foundation of knowledge."
 verrier.9010.h: "One cannot know how unexpectedly a new truth can find a purpose."
