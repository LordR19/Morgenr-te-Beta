 klimt.1300.d: "The Poor Poet (German: Der arme Poet) is the best known and most popular painting by German painter Carl Spitzweg. It was executed in 1839 and had three versions. It is considered an early masterpiece."
 klimt.1300.f: "Carl Spitzweg was a German romanticist painter and poet. He is considered to be one of the most important artists of the Biedermeier era. His father, a wealthy merchant, had Carl trained as a pharmacist. He attained his qualification from the University of Munich, but while recovering from an illness he also took up painting. Spitzweg was self-taught as an artist, and began by copying the works of Flemish masters. He contributed his first work to satiric magazines. Upon receiving an inheritance in 1833, he was able to dedicate himself to painting. His later paintings and drawings were often humorous genre works. Many of his paintings depict sharply characterized eccentrics."
 klimt.1300.g: "Ahahah, a funny painter!"
 klimt.1300.h: "Wait! Satire against whom?"
