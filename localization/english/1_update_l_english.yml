 manzoni.1208.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_writer_scope').GetFullName] was an Italian writer and journalist who later became known for his children's literature. De Amicis was a patriot and fought in the Italian Wars of Independence, but resigned from his service because he was disillusioned with the army. As an avowed Freemason, De Amicis made an effort in his works to replace the Catholicism deep in the Italian soul with secular virtues and commitment to the state. In later years, socialist ideas had a formative influence on him." #please replace
 manzoni.1208.f: "\"This book is particularly dedicated to elementary school children, who are between 9 and 13 years old, and it could be titled: Story of a school year, written by a third grader from a municipal school in Italy. By saying written by a third grader, I don't mean that he actually wrote it, as it is printed. He gradually noted in a notebook, as he knew, what he had seen, heard, thought, in school and outside; and his father, at the end of the year, wrote these pages on those notes, taking care not to alter his thoughts, and to preserve, as much as possible, his son's words. Who then, 4 years later, already being in high school, reread the manuscript and added something of his own, making use of his still fresh memory of the people and things. Now read this book, boys: I hope you will be happy with it and that it will do you some good.\"\n- Edoardo de Amicis, Cuore" #please replace
