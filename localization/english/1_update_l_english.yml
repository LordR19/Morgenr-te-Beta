 gaudi.701.t: "Construction of Neuschwanstein begins"
 gaudi.701.d: "The Bavarian King chose a place near the older Hohenschwangau residence, which he knew from his childhood. It is already clear that the actual construction management lies not with the selected architects, but with the monarch."
 gaudi.701.f: "'I intend to have the old Hohenschwangau castle ruins near the Pöllat Gorge rebuilt in the true style of the old German knights' castles.' -King Ludwig II"
 gaudi.701.g: "The king is either a genius or a madman."
 gaudi.702.t: "Neuschwanstein: First Phase finishes"
 gaudi.702.d: "On the hill near Füssen, the Palas is now clearly visible over the Bavarian Allgäu. The Neuschwanstein gatehouse is already there."
 gaudi.702.f: "'... in every respect this castle will be more beautiful and homely than the lower Hohenschwangau...' -King Ludwig II"
 gaudi.702.g: "Looks cheesier than planned."
 gaudi.703.t: "Construction of Neuschwanstein continues"
 gaudi.703.d: "The next construction phase of Neuschwanstein Castle has begun. There are now increasing voices calling the ostentatious building a complete waste of money."
 gaudi.703.f: "Contrary to popular rumors, Ludwig II financed Neuschwanstein entirely from his private assets. Due to his lack of money, he was also receptive to financial donations from the former Prussian counterpart. In order to gain the goodwill of Bavaria at the coronation of the Prussian King Wilhelm as German Kaiser, Bismarck paid the ruler an annual pension of 300,000 Reichsmarks. At the end of his life, Ludwig's private debts amounted to 8.25 million Reichsmarks."
 gaudi.703.g: "How much will it cost?"
 gaudi.704.t: "Neuschwanstein completed"
 gaudi.704.d: "Neuschwanstein was finally completed today! History will show whether the building will go down in the tradition of Louis XIV as an expression of nostalgic megalomania, or whether the myth of the king will live on for centuries. In case of doubt, both should be the case."

 gaudi.709.t: "Bavaria lost!"
 gaudi.709.d: "With the loss of Bavaria, we lost every opportunity to continue building the Neuschwanstein Castle."
 gaudi.709.f: "Should Bavaria be lost for any reason, the construction progress will not be lost as a whole. Only Bavaria can continue building the Neuschwanstein Castle at the last construction phase. Foreign invaders, on the other hand, will show no interest in further construction."
 gaudi.709.g: "We can't leave Bavaria to them for long!"

 gaudi.711.t: "Bad bricks"
 gaudi.711.d: "The last delivery of material for Neuschwanstein turned out to be poor."
 gaudi.711.f: "For a moment, the usual activity at the construction site, where the Neuschwanstein Castle grew taller every day, died down. A brief inventory by the King himself revealed that the bricks were not of the usual quality and has announced that he would prefer to wait before his masterpiece could be jeopardized by these bricks. However, there are voices in the construction management that the bricks should still be used - not only because the construction could be delayed, but also because there are fears that the monarch could use the time to change the plan again ..."
 gaudi.712.t: "Disaster!"
 gaudi.712.d: "The inferior material has taken its toll: this morning a section of Neuschwanstein collapsed and caused considerable damage."
 gaudi.712.f: "Perhaps the King was right. Perhaps it really wasn't a good idea to use crumbling bricks for a monument as important as the Neuschwanstein Castle. Perhaps one should therefore have thought twice about this decision. But too late - the substandard material took its toll today, leading to the collapse of a wall and destroying large parts of the construction progress of the last few weeks and months when a facade collapsed."
 gaudi.713.t: "Opposition criticizes Neuschwanstein"
 gaudi.713.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_opposition_leader').GetFullName] sent a petition to the King."
 gaudi.713.f: "'Abroad people are already laughing at a monarch who thinks he is - depending on his mood - a fairytale king or the reincarnation of Louis XIV. The royal family's indebtedness in favor of outdated dreams must stop. Bavaria is making itself the laughing stock of Europe. Such behavior is unbecoming of a king.'"
 gaudi.713.g: "I'm the King and I build what I want!"
 gaudi.713.h: "Maybe this IS vanity?"
 gaudi.714.t: "New machines"
 gaudi.714.d: "Technical progress also helps in the construction of a seemingly old-fashioned building such as a medieval castle."
 gaudi.714.f: "The machine factory in Munich and the modern steel frame construction make it possible to rebuild Neuschwanstein in a record time that was previously unknown."
 gaudi.715.t: "Neigbour impressed by Neuschwanstein"
 gaudi.715.d: "Our neighboring country [SCOPE.sCountry('gaudi_neighbour_nation').GetName] was amazed to see the dedication with which Bavaria is working on the dream of the ideal castle and has expressed great interest in the progress of the construction work."
 gaudi.715.f: "Neuschwanstein is the most famous of Ludwig II's castles and one of the most famous sights in Germany. Since it was opened to visitors in the year Ludwig died, the complex has seen a steadily increasing number of guests. Around 18,000 people visited the castle in the first eight weeks alone. In 1913 there were over 28,000 guests, and in 1939 there were already 290,000. By 2001 the number had grown to around 1.3 million visitors, including 560,000 Germans and 385,000 Americans and English. The third largest group that year was the 149,000 Japanese. By 2005, a total of over 50 million visitors had been counted."

 gaudi.715.h: "Ask for a donation."
 gaudi.716.t: "The King just had another idea ..."
 gaudi.716.d: "Our monarch recently surprised the construction management with a change."
 gaudi.716.f: "Construction of the castle began in 1869. Ludwig II's wishes and demands grew with the construction, as did the expenses, and the designs and cost estimates had to be revised several times. Instead of the large throne room, only a modest study was originally planned, and planned guest rooms were deleted from the plans to make room for a Moorish Hall, which could not be realized due to the constant lack of money. The completion of the castle, originally scheduled for 1872, was repeatedly delayed."

 gaudi.717.d: "The construction of the Neuschwanstein Castle is progressing faster than expected for reasons that are not specified."
 gaudi.717.f: "For reasons unknown, the construction of the majestic Neuschwanstein Castle is progressing. Maybe it was the good weather. Possibly the prayer to the Holy Virgin. Possibly also the rather inferior building material that we squandered the other day and that we hope will never be found. One thing is certain: this monster, which has repeatedly experienced delays due to the most varied of circumstances, should be finished faster than expected. Assuming the King doesn't use this to try and make up for the time savings with a new expansion..."
 gaudi.718.t: "A National or a Royal Project?"
 gaudi.718.d: "There is currently a serious debate in Parliament as to whether the Neuschwanstein Castle is primarily a national or a royal building."
 gaudi.718.f: "Neuschwanstein Castle, in its remote location in the Allgäu, was intended from the outset as the king's private retreat. Nevertheless, the building also had romantic and therefore national implications, at least for outsiders: the transfiguration of the Middle Ages as the actual high point of German history was part of the narrative of the national movement. At the same time, the castle was a stone homage to Richard Wagner, the national composer of the divided German nation."
 gaudi.718.g: "This is a national project."
 gaudi.718.h: "This is a national and a royal project."
 gaudi.718.i: "This is a royal project."
 gaudi.719.t: "The Monarch makes a visit"
 gaudi.719.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetFullName] has decided to pay a personal visit to the Neuschwanstein construction site."
 gaudi.719.f: "Our monarch [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetFirstName] keeps a constant eye on how construction is progressing and has announced another visit. The preparations are in full swing - and of course they want to offer something to His Majesty! Simple construction workers, the construction management and the chief architect have therefore set a previously unknown chord speed after the announcement."
 gaudi.719.g: "His Majesty knows how to motivate."
 gaudi.720.t: "Construction site fire"
 gaudi.720.d: "For unknown reasons, a fire broke out on the Neuschwanstein construction site and set the work back for months!"
 gaudi.720.f: "'Is someone playing Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries right now?!'"
 gaudi.720.g: "Terrible! It's like Wagner!"
 gaudi.721.t: "A Royal Hand for Workers"
 gaudi.721.d: "A union leader has asked the king to compensate for the dangerous work on the construction site of Neuschwanstein Castle with better care."
 gaudi.721.f: "The large construction site was the region's largest employer for around two decades. In 1880, around 200 craftsmen worked on the construction site every day, not counting suppliers and other people indirectly involved in the construction. At times when the king demanded particularly tight deadlines and urgent changes, there were said to have been up to 300 workers per day who also worked at night by the light of oil lamps. The social institution 'Association of Craftsmen at the Royal Palace in Hohenschwangau', founded on April 3, 1870, was very modern. The purpose of the association was to guarantee continued payment of wages for sick or injured construction workers with low monthly contributions and reinforced by significant subsidies from the king. The construction company, similar to today's social insurance or professional association, guaranteed the salary for 15 weeks for an amount of 0.70 marks. There was a pension for the descendants of those who died during construction - although low, it was not common at the time."
 gaudi.721.g: "An institution worth supporting."
 gaudi.721.h: "A role model for the whole country!"
 gaudi.721.i: "Social assistance? I need workers, not whiners!"

A section of this housing, on Santa Isabel Alley, was torn down and replaced by the National Theater in the latter 19th century. During the late 19th century and very early 20th, this theatre was the site of most of Mexico City's high culture, presenting events such as theatre, operettas, Viennese dance and more. It was then decided to replace this building with a more opulent one for the upcoming Centennial of Mexican Independence celebrations in 1910.

The facade of the palace was made of white marble, and the interior of the building was made of different colored marble. For this reason, the building has such immense weight that the palace is now several meters lower than the surrounding streets."

There are also sculptures by André Allar in the palace, which are dedicated to the seven muses. The building's ten ornate iron gates were commissioned from the Italian Alessandro Mazzucotelli.

The Aztec Tenochtitlan was the predecessor city located in the middle of a lake. This lake had been drained over the centuries, and the muddy soil had already proven to be less solid in the past.

 gaudi.819.f: "The outstanding significance of Mexico City dates back to pre-colonial times, when Tenochtitlán was considered the capital of the Aztec Empire and had numerous central functions. From the Spaniards destroyed and rebuilt as a colonial metropolis, the city became the seat of the centralist Colonial administration. At the end of the 19th century the importance was strengthened by the expansion of the railway network. With the beginning of the 20th century, in addition to its function as a financial and trading center, the city gained importance as an industrial location. The prospect of work attracted hundreds of thousands to the capital over decades. Construction projects such as the Palacio de Bellas Artes provided an incentive."

Standing on 4,657,576 square feet (432,703 square meters) of land, Gyeongbokgung again became an iconic symbol for both the Korean nation and the Korean royal family. In 1894, the Japanese occupied the palace and forced Gojong to establish a pro-Japanese government. Due to its status as the symbol of national sovereignty, Gyeongbokgung was extensively damaged during the Japanese occupation of the early 20th century. In 1911, ownership of land at the palace was transferred to the Japanese Governor-General. In 1915, on the pretext of holding an exhibition, more than 90% of the buildings were torn down. Following the exhibition, the Japanese leveled whatever still remained and built their colonial headquarters, the Government-General Building, on the site."

 je_lepsius_dreamtime: "The Dreamtime"
 je_lepsius_dreamtime_reason: "The British ethnologist Walter Baldwin Spencer and his Australian colleague Francis James Gillen translated the word alcheringa from the Central Australian language Arrernte as dreaming. For Aboriginal people, the dreamtime is about the spiritual, natural and moral order of the cosmos. In this context, dreaming means the collective ability to correctly understand and use the world and its connections, to reflect on the mythical world within the framework of a cult act, and to have life force. A number of places of worship related to this Dreamtime, other Aboriginal myths and archaeological and anthropological remains are spread across Australia. It is time to thoroughly examine the past of the last continent."

The inscription carved into the stele is the oldest and most detailed surviving source on the history of the Goguryeo Kingdom. When the Kingdom of Goguryeo and its successor Balhae fell in 668, the region around Guonei and Wandu lost importance. After the Manchu conquest of the Chinese Empire in 1644, the emperors of the new Qing dynasty declared a wide zone north of the Yalu River a restricted area. It was not until the second half of the 19th century that the area was opened to settlement again. Around 1876, a Chinese official rediscovered the stele, which was completely overgrown and partially sunk into the ground."
