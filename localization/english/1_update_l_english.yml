 panum.501.t: "Yello Fever spreads to [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]"
 panum.501.d: "Reports of new cases of yellow fever have confirmed our worst fears. The disease is now also raging in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]!"
 panum.501.g: "Why wasn't it possible to stop this?"
 panum.502.t: "A contagious disease?"
 panum.502.d: "Although it is not clear whether yellow fever is a contagious disease or has other causes, many safety-minded citizens are calling for quarantine to stop the spread. If we don't do this, they could see it as ignorance or disinterest in their needs."
 panum.502.f: "The first outbreaks of yellow fever in the 17th century caused panic and disorientation. Even in the 18th century, people largely disagreed about what triggered an infection. Although governments and individuals resorted to strict measures or prevention, there was no success. The fear of yellow fever meant that no opportunity was wasted to prevent its further spread, sometimes with experimental or draconian measures. Some actions could therefore have psychological rather than medical reasons in order to avoid escalating the discontent among the population."
 panum.502.g: "There is no evidence that this is a contagious disease."
 panum.503.t: "Yellow Fever affects Plantations"
 panum.503.d: "Reports are received daily that the plantations in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] in particular have a high rate of yellow fever sufferers. Some government advisors are pushing to stop work there completely to reduce the spread."
 panum.503.f: "'A poor black man, named Sampson, went constantly from house to house where distress was, and no assistance, without fee or reward. He was smitten with the disorder, and died. After his death his family were neglected by those he had served. Sarah Bass, a poor black widow, gave all the assistance she could, in several families, for which she did not receive any thing; and when any thing was offered her, she left it to the option of those she served.' -Richard Allen"
 panum.503.g: "Get the workers out of the fields!"
 panum.503.h: "The plantation must continue to run, at all costs!"
 panum.504.t: "Evacuation"
 panum.504.d: "The health situation in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] continues to worsen. Members of the local government and administration have asked to leave the city and organize administration from the countryside. Some consider it a clever suggestion, others consider it sheer cowardice."
 panum.504.f: "During the 1793 Yellow Fever epidemic in Philadelphia, 5,000 or more people were listed in the register of deaths between August 1 and November 9. The vast majority of them died of yellow fever, making the epidemic in the city of 50,000 people one of the most severe in United States history. By the end of September, 20,000 people had fled the city, including congressional and executive officials of the federal government. Most did not return until after the epidemic had abated in late November. President George Washington left the city for his Mount Vernon estate. The mortality rate peaked in October before frost finally killed the mosquitoes and brought an end to the outbreak. Some neighboring towns refused to let refugees in from Philadelphia, fearing that they were carrying the fever. Major port cities, including those in Baltimore and New York City had quarantines against refugees and goods from Philadelphia, although New York City sent financial aid to Philadelphia."
 panum.504.g: "Evacuate the authorities."
 panum.504.h: "The local administration must not collapse."
 panum.505.t: "Yellow Fever spreads to Barracks"
 panum.505.d: "Yellow fever is currently primarily contaminating [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]'s military facilities. It takes its deadly toll there."
 panum.505.f: "For the rebels in Haiti at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and in Cuba almost 100 years later, yellow fever was the great ally against the colonial armies sent from Europe. The leader of the Cuban independence struggle spoke of his 'invincible generals June, July, August' - those months in which the rains come and with them the mosquitoes. The British had similar experiences during the siege of Cartagena in 1741. 29,000 British soldiers besieged the fortress. When the rains began, 22,000 perished miserably within a few weeks. The mortality rate in British garrisons in Jamaica was seven times that of garrisons in Canada, mostly because of yellow fever and other tropical diseases."
 panum.505.g: "No! They were destined for an honorable death on the battlefield!"
 panum.506.t: "Sailor's sickness"
 panum.506.d: "Port operations in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] have come to a virtual standstill due to yellow fever. On the one hand, many dock workers and seafarers are sick. On the other hand, as many ships as possible try to avoid the cursed region."
 panum.506.f: "'The most deplorable havoc is being made in New Orleans by the yellow fever. Thousands have been carried off by its ravages, and every day adds 200 more to the ghastly record. The dead are buried in trenches by chain gangs of negroes, hired at a guinea an hour. And thus, what with the songs and the obscene jests of the gravediggers, the buzzing of the flies, the sing-song cries of the huxter-women vending their confections, the hoarse oaths of the men who drive the dead carts, the merry whistle of the boys, and the stifling reek from the scores of blackened corpses, the day wears apace, the work of sepulture is done, and night draws the curtain. In the meantime, amusements, regattas, balls, &c. are preceding as usual, as if no such appalling pestilence was in the doomed city.' -Cambridge Weekly News in 1853"
 panum.506.g: "A collapse for shipping!"
 panum.507.t: "Black Vomit"
 panum.507.d: "In [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName], yellow fever is striking more violently than expected. Doctors report that more people than before have died from the disease."
 panum.507.f: "'Those who ventured abroad, had handkerchiefs or sponges impregnated with vinegar of camphor at their noses, or smelling-bottles full of the thieves' vinegar. Others carried pieces of tarred rope in their hands or pockets, or camphor bags tied round their necks... People hastily shifted their course at the sight of a hearse coming towards them. Many never walked on the footpath, but went into the middle of the streets, to avoid being infected in passing by houses wherein people had died. Acquaintances and friends avoided each other in the streets, and only signified their regard by a cold nod. The old custom of shaking hands fell in such general disuse, that many shrunk back with affright at even the offer of a hand. A person with mourning crepe, or any appearance of mourning, was shunned like a viper.'' -Mathew Carey"
 panum.507.g: "When will we finally be freed from this plague?"
