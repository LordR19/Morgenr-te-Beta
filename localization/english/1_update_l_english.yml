 je_mendelejew_synthetic_oil: "Research into Coal Liquefaction"
 je_mendelejew_synthetic_oil_reason: "Coal liquefaction, also coal hydrogenation, today predominantly called coal-to-liquid (CtL for short), is a carbochemical process for converting lignite or hard coal into liquid basic chemicals and synthetic fuels such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene. Between 1910 and 1925, Friedrich Bergius developed a high-pressure process, which was subsequently modified by Matthias Pier: the first large-scale process for coal liquefaction. This is a direct hydrogenation that is carried out in two phases. In 1925, Franz Fischer, then director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Coal Research, and his colleague Hans Tropsch discovered a reaction that is one of the most important in the field of heterogeneous catalysis and whose scientific, economic and social significance is still visible today."

 mendelejew.701.t: "Coal to Oil"
 mendelejew.701.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has achieved a historic achievement that will go down in chemical history. After years of experimentation and building a new laboratory, our chief chemist has managed to produce synthetic fuel. This will revolutionize the entire chemical industry."
 mendelejew.701.f: "Systematic research into equivalent substitutes for the production of gasoline began in Germany after the First World War. On the one hand, various governments of the Weimar Republic constantly questioned the imports of oil due to the economic situation and increasingly sought self-sufficient supplies. On the other hand, US scientists predicted in a study that was taken seriously around the world that global oil reserves would be exhausted in a short time, while motorization was increasing inexorably. Against this background, with government support, researchers and companies turned with great intensity to the energy source that Germany had in abundance: coal. The fact that benzene can be obtained from coal was already known at the beginning of the 19th century - long before petroleum gasoline. The German chemist Friedrich Bergius filed the first patent for carbon hydrogenation in 1913, for which he received the Nobel Prize together with Carl Bosch."
 mendelejew.701.g: "This means that we have a self-sufficient oil supply."

 mendelejew_chemist_periodic_table_inventor trait: "Inventor of the Periodic Table"
 mendelejew_chemist_periodic_table_inventor trait_desc: "As the originator of the periodic table, this character is particularly good at theorizing elements."

 mendelejew.801.t: "The Periodic Table of Elements"
 mendelejew.801.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has managed to organize the previously known chemical elements and even make predictions about which elements were still missing. As previously suspected, the properties of the elements in a predictable system repeat themselves periodically - that's why Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] named it 'Periodic Table of Elements'."
 mendelejew.801.f: "The modern periodic table was developed by Lothar Meyer and Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleyev. Both published their results in 1869 and jointly received the Davy Medal from the British Royal Society in 1882 for their work. Mendeleyev is mentioned more often than Meyer as the founder of today's periodic table. On the one hand, because Meyer's periodic table was published a few months later, and on the other hand, because Mendeleyev made predictions about the properties of the elements that had not yet been discovered. In Russia, the periodic table is still called Tabliza Mendeleyeva (Mendeleyev's table). Neither Mendeleyev nor Meyer knew each other's work on the periodic table. Mendeleyev was also not aware of the works of Béguyer de Chancourtois from 1862, Newlands from 1863/64 or Hinrichs from 1866/67."
 mendelejew.801.g: "Chemistry is now a proper science."

 je_mendelejew_periodic_table: "An Order of Elements"
 je_mendelejew_periodic_table_reason: "At the beginning of the 19th century, regularities in the relationships between the elements were already being sought. Obstacles included, among other things, the uncertainties in the atomic masses and the fact that numerous elements were not yet known. Döbereiner was the first to establish a connection between atomic mass and the chemical properties of individual elements. In 1824, Falckner published a system of natural element families. However, the big breakthrough has not yet occurred."

It was here, on a cold winter's day, that a celestial event of unprecedented magnitude unfolded, forever linking this peaceful settlement with the vast, mysterious universe beyond. The year was 1868. On January 30th, the residents of Pułtusk went about their daily routines, unaware that their lives were about to intersect with an extraordinary phenomenon. As the afternoon gave way to the evening, an unusual silence fell over the town. Without warning, a brilliant light pierced the sky. A fireball, more radiant than the sun, blazed across the heavens. Witnesses described it as a blazing orb, trailing a luminous tail, splitting the sky with a thunderous roar. The fireball, later identified as a meteorite, fragmented explosively as it entered Earth's atmosphere. Thousands of pieces rained down over Pułtusk and its surrounding areas, creating a shower of meteoritic stones. This event became known as the Pułtusk meteorite shower."

Hundreds of luminous meteors, varying in size and brilliance, streaked across the heavens, originating from a single point and dispersing in all directions. These meteors, leaving trails of bright white and glowing yellow light, created an awe-inspiring display. Larger fragments, with fiery cores, disintegrated into smaller pieces before vanishing in the lower atmosphere. Distant cannon-like sounds echoed, reflecting the immense energy of their fragmentation. Residents, initially startled, soon gathered to marvel at the celestial spectacle. A subsequent search uncovered numerous small meteorite fragments scattered across the landscape, primarily composed of iron and nickel.

 MR_CHEMIST_CONGRESS_BUTTON_TT: "#T Chemist Congress#!\nThe Karlsruhe Congress was the first international symposium on modern chemistry. It took place from September 3rd to 5th, 1860 on the initiative of Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz, Charles Adolphe Wurtz and Karl Weltzien in the Ständehaus in Karlsruhe. Topics included the nomenclature of chemical compounds and their formulaic representation as well as the question of the atomic and molecular weights of chemical compounds. It was the first international chemistry conference in the world.\n\n[ScriptedGui.BuildTooltip( GuiScope.SetRoot( GetPlayer.MakeScope ).End )]" # please replace
