 ### CONCEPTS ###

 concept_curtiss_tourism: "Tourism"
 concept_curtiss_tourism_desc: "Tourism provides a culturally superior nation with additional income. Unique monuments, museums and art galleries, archaeological sites, centers of art as well as high values in the various cultural traditions are factors that make a nation an attractive tourist destination. Laws that increase freedom of movement and economic activity also contribute to higher tourism income. The infrastructure also plays a crucial role - after all, remote places cannot be reached. An airport in particular revolutionizes tourism and provides a significant increase in revenue."
