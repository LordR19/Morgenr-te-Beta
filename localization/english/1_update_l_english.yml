The doctor hopes that this could result in a complete description of the disease."
 panum.51.f: "A complete description of a disease is a first step towards understanding it and later combating it. Descriptions do not yet have a direct effect on alleviation, but are the foundation of a later treatment method. Physicians who study an epidemic in their own country work more effectively than physicians on a trip abroad."

 panum.131.t: "Discontinued Disease Studies"
 panum.131.d: "Since the dangerous epidemic in [GetPlayer.GetName] has come to an end and the last patients have now recovered, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has finished [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] studies for the time being. The doctor has been able to collect some important information that should simplify a future scientific description of the disease, but [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] has not yet achieved a breakthrough"
 panum.131.f: "'All speculation as to its origin and its causes, if causes can be found adequate to produce so great a disturbance, I leave to other writers, whether lay or professional; for myself, I shall simply set down its nature, and explain the symptoms by which perhaps it may be recognized by the student, if it should ever break out again. This I can the better do, as I had the disease myself, and watched its operation in the case of others.' -Thucydides"
 panum.131.g: "Another step has been taken."
 panum.133.t: "Discontinued Medical Expedition"
 panum.133.d: "The medical expedition has finished its work for now as the epidemic is over. Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] did not manage to complete a scientific description, but [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] studies should be valuable for the future."
 panum.134.d: "The terrible epidemic that hit our country has passed. But this also means that Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has to stop [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] investigations for the time being because [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] cannot carry out any further experiments to find a treatment method for the disease. Nevertheless, the doctor has gained valuable insights that will certainly be useful in the future."
 panum.134.f: "'Contagion passes from one thing to another, and is originally caused by infection of the imperceptible particle.' -Girolamo Fracastoro"
 panum.134.g: "It's only a matter of time before we find a cure."
 panum.136.d: "Unfortunately, the medical research expedition has been ended for the time being without any final results. Since the epidemic has left the country, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] did not verify [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] theories. The interim results will be available to [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim] and future generations to finally find a treatment method."
