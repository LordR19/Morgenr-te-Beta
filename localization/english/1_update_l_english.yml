 je_gaudi_neuschwanstein_phase_1_reason: "Neuschwanstein is considered the prime example of historicism and German Romanticism. The fairytale castle, which would later be seen by many as the 'ideal' castle per se, was designed by the Bavarian King Ludwig II. Although it was not uncommon in the 19th century for monarchs to have medieval castles built in a magnificent style, Neuschwanstein should serve as an example surpass and become a landmark not only of Bavaria, but of the entire German-speaking world."

 je_gaudi_neuschwanstein_phase_2: "Neuschwanstein: A Fairytale Castle"
 je_gaudi_neuschwanstein_phase_2_reason: "From the beginning, Neuschwanstein was not intended for representation or the public, but as a private retreat for the king. He based his work on medieval Christian myths, but above all on the operas of Richward Wagner, whom he supported financially and admired. The king's ever-new ideas and his desire to build a stone opera stage for eternity with Neuschwanstein significantly delayed construction and brought Ludwig II to the brink of ruin."
