[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] played a significant role in this and is now considered a leading figure of the realistic school of painting."
 artists.2007.f: "In art history, realism refers to a new conception of art that began in Europe in the middle of the 19th century, which turned against representations of classicism and romanticism. In art, realism attempts to recreate reality as closely as possible. The artist's appropriation of reality and its subsequent transformation into a work of art as well as its political connotations are characteristic of realism. It promotes everydayness and objectivity. Its best-known representative was the French painter Gustave Courbet, who appropriated the term realistic art and used it for his art because of its provocative effect."

 klimt.30.f: "The Vienna Secession is an art movement, closely related to Art Nouveau, that was formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian painters, graphic artists, sculptors and architects, including Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, Otto Wagner and Gustav Klimt. They resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists in protest against its support for more traditional artistic styles. Their most influential architectural work was the Secession Building designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich as a venue for expositions of the group. Their official magazine was called Ver Sacrum (Sacred Spring, in Latin), which published highly stylised and influential works of graphic art. In 1905 the group itself split, when some of the most prominent members, including Klimt, Wagner, and Hoffmann, resigned in a dispute over priorities, but it continued to function, and still functions today, from its headquarters in the Secession Building. In its current form, the Secession exhibition gallery is independently led and managed by artists."

However, this will take months - and the fee is hefty."
 klimt.424.f: "'Painting is an essentially concrete art and can only consist of the representation of real and existing things.' -Gustave Coubert"
 klimt.424.g: "This may take some time, but it's worth it."
 klimt.424.h: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] should rather concentrate on gaining recognition from the master."
 klimt.425.t: "Inspiration without limits"
 klimt.425.d: "Since his arrival in [SCOPE.sState('klimt_center_of_art_scope').GetCityHubName], [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has had hundreds and thousands of impressions. It's been a long time since one idea followed the next. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] can literally feel how this place invigorates him."
 klimt.425.f: "'Since the appearance of Impressionism, the official salons, which used to be brown, have become blue, green, and red.. .But peppermint or chocolate, they are still confections.' -Claude Monet"
 klimt.425.g: "These new ideas will inspire him to create numerous paintings."
 klimt.425.h: "These new ideas should inspire our culture at home."
 klimt.426.t: "An Artist's Life"
 klimt.426.d: "The sophisticated life in [SCOPE.sState('klimt_center_of_art_scope').GetCityHubName] has also left its mark on [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. He often hangs out in bars and pubs - and uses stimulants to increase his creative power. Without one or two intoxications, he would hardly be able to complete his workload in such a short time."
 klimt.426.f: "'After the first glass, you see things as you wish they were.\nAfter the second, you see things as they are not.\nFinally, you see things as they really are,\nwhich is the most horrible thing in the world.' -Oscar Wilde"
 klimt.426.g: "If that inspires his art - where is the problem?"
 klimt.426.h: "Then it just takes longer."
 klimt.427.t: "An Artist's Vice"
 klimt.427.d: "We are receiving worrying reports from [SCOPE.sState('klimt_center_of_art_scope').GetCityHubName]. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s addictions reach frightening proportions. Apparently he uses his absence to indulge in vices and debauchery, which put a significant strain on his health."
 klimt.427.f: "Camille Pissarro, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, Oscar Wilde and Charles Baudelaire - they all fell victim to absinthe intoxication. The same applies to Vincent van Gogh. Gabriele D'Annunzio, on the other hand, was looking for erotic adventures. Jean Cocteau discovered opium for himself and wrote a diary about its use and effects. The fact that in many cases these addictions and vices led to self-destruction and premature death is one of the tragic episodes of artists' lives."
 klimt.427.g: "Every artist has a vice."
 klimt.427.h: "We have to intervene!"
 klimt.427.tt: "The educational trip is cancelled. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] is taken into custody by our agents in [SCOPE.sState('klimt_center_of_art_scope').GetCityHubName] and brought back to [GetPlayer.GetName]. He will be put into rehab there for the next six months."
 klimt.428.t: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] is available again"
 klimt.428.d: "After a break of several months, our painter has returned to his usual day-to-day business. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] didn't give up his lifestyle, but at least something worse could be prevented."
 klimt.428.f: "'A kidnapping? No, no, monsieur, that was an intervention. A kidnapping would happen to your suffering, an intervention is only initiated for your good... what do you mean, we don't know what's best for you?'"
 klimt.428.g: "Hopefully things will return to normal now."

 klimt.431.t: "Veduta"
 klimt.431.d: "Inspired by the beauty of his host city [SCOPE.sState('klimt_center_of_art_scope').GetCityHubName] our painter began painting a masterful veduta picture on an educational trip. However, that could extend his stay a bit."
 klimt.431.f: "A veduta is a highly detailed, usually large-scale painting or, more often, print of a cityscape or some other vista. The painters of vedute are referred to as vedutisti. In the later 19th century, more personal "impressions" of cityscapes replaced the desire for topographical accuracy, which was satisfied instead by painted, and later photographed, panoramas. The most important veduta painters of this time include David Roberts and Eduard Gaertner."
 klimt.431.g: "A splendid idea."
 klimt.431.h: "Concentrate on studying."
 klimt.432.t: "Painting Circle"
 klimt.432.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has been welcomed into [SCOPE.sState('klimt_center_of_art_scope').GetCityHubName]'s local artist group as one of their own."
 klimt.432.f: "'I must stay alone and know that I am alone to contemplate and feel nature in full; I have to surrender myself to what encircles me, I have to merge with my clouds and rocks in order to be what I am. Solitude is indispensible for my dialogue with nature.' -Caspar David Friedrich"
 klimt.432.g: "We need the recognition of the painting world."
 klimt.433.t: "Quick Comprehension"
 klimt.433.d: "On his educational journey in [SCOPE.sState('klimt_center_of_art_scope').GetCityHubName], our artist is making faster progress than expected. Maybe he can return sooner."
 klimt.433.f: "'Talent does whatever it wants to do. Genius does only what it can.' -Eugène Delacroix"
 klimt.433.g: "You can see talent at first glance."
 klimt.434.t: "Art Dealer"
 klimt.434.d: "During his educational stay, [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] found a renowned art dealer who might sell a few pieces."
 klimt.434.f: "'I am an absolutely serious businessman. My competitors' slanders that I sell counterfeits are only due to envy. Can I now get you excited about this painting? A real Leonardo da Vinci: The Lady with the Sistine Degu. A rarity! An offer like this will never come again!'"
 klimt.434.g: "Buy some paintings."
 klimt.434.h: "We don't need second-rate foreign goods."
 klimt.435.t: "The Latest Fashion"
 klimt.435.d: "On his educational journey, our artist learned about new fashions, new architectural styles and new pastimes that were previously unknown to him."
 klimt.435.f: "'Men who came from England knew how to tell their astonished friends that the people across the Channel, however sensible they were, were still very fond of childish pleasures. So young people entertain themselves by kicking a leather ball around on a meadow, others hit the ball over a net with a kind of carpet beater, and this madness attracts spectators in every crowd. Among them there are people in office and dignity - who sometimes even don't disdain to get involved themselves.'"
 klimt.435.g: "The fresh breath of new culture."
 klimt.435.h: "But is it really right to just follow the zeitgeist?"
