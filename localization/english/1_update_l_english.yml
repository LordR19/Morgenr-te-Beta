 curtiss.322.f: "Although the Zeppelin attacks only caused comparatively little damage, they spread disproportionate fear and terror among the enemy in the military and civilian population and tied up large amounts of resources that were important for the war effort. To combat German military airships, the Entente Cordiale, with its approximately 15,000 men and an average of around 25 airships, had to provide weapons, material and people at a ratio of almost 1:33. Although other branches of the armed forces, such as the naval forces, also adopted such retention strategies, the efficiency of the airships remained unmatched, even by the German submarines. Nevertheless, the Zeppelin attacks neither permanently shook the morale of those attacked nor seriously hindered their war efforts."

[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('curtiss_pilot_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] valuable reconnaissance work helps the army to take over enemy territory much more quickly."
 curtiss.327.f: "'In the beginning, people probably didn't have much faith in the successes of aviation reconnaissance, but they were soon taught otherwise. The airport is always a few kilometers behind the battlefield, approximately at the general command. You get your order here at the airport. You then fly up so that you are about 1200 meters above the enemy. Flying lower is hardly advisable, as the French infantry missile reaches quite high. I already have several holes from it in the wings. From this height you can observe quite well when the weather is reasonably nice. Our double-deckers are very fast (around 110 kilometers per hour), and so you can cover quite a distance in a short time. The observer then records what he saw and you fly back. From the airfield, the report is then brought to the general command by car.' -Anonymous Pilot, 'Die Woche', Berlin, September 26, 1914"

 curtiss.331.g: "Worrying."

 curtiss.400.t: "Air Show"
 curtiss.400.d: "A real aircraft parade also includes an air show with spectacular formations and maneuvers. These risky performances demonstrate our military's aviation prowess and delight audiences. Should [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('curtiss_pilot_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] attempt a daring, but more grand maneuver, or a more cautious variant from the standard repertoire?"
 curtiss.400.f: "A pilot can acquire the aerobatic pilot trait by performing a fantastic air show maneuver. However, in the case of daring maneuvers, the performance can also fail and lead to a catastrophic accident. To prevent this, a pilot should have enough experience and positive traits such as Fighter Pilot, Schneider Trophy Veteran, Brave or Tactful. Aerobatic pilots always perform fantastic maneuvers."

 curtiss.414.d: "The air show has turned into a horror event: [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('curtiss_pilot_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] lost control of his plane while executing a risky maneuver and crashed! Several spectators were injured and the unlucky pilot died during the performance. The event was canceled immediately."
 curtiss.414.g: "Disastrous!"
 curtiss.411.f: "An air show is an outdoor event in which pilots demonstrate their aircraft in flight. They often demonstrate spectacular flight maneuvers and flight conditions, for example aerobatics. They show these alone or in formation flight. In this way they demonstrate their flying skills and those of their aircraft. Quickly successive flight maneuvers are intended to entertain and impress the audience. Many flight maneuvers demonstrated by military pilots are common military aircraft flight maneuvers. They are regularly trained by the pilots, among other things, in preparation for air combat. The first public international air show at which many different types of aircraft were presented and flown was the Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne, which was held in Reims from August 22nd to 29th, 1909. Another air show took place in Brescia, Italy, in September of the same year. In the past, there have been numerous, sometimes serious, accidents at air shows and during training for air shows. They were favored, among other things, by narrow distances between the aircraft, low altitudes and high flight speeds."
 
 curtiss.421.t: "Aerobatic Team"
 curtiss.421.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_general_scope').GetFullName] is not only a capable commander, but also known for his piloting skills. The general formed an aerobatic team from several officers to demonstrate a formation maneuver on the occasion of the aircraft parade."
 curtiss.421.f: "Aerobatic teams are groups of pilots who master and demonstrate aerobatics. Several flying objects form a unit called a squadron. Many aerobatic teams are air force units in squadron strength. England is considered the cradle of aerobatics. Aviation was perfected there in the 1920s, both alone and in teams. It was also during this time that the first public events were held at airfields, which already attracted thousands of visitors."
 curtiss.421.g: "Nice show."
 curtiss.422.t: "New Prototype at the Aircraft Parade"
 curtiss.422.d: "On the occasion of the aircraft parade taking place, [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_engineer_scope').GetFullName] built a prototype of a new airplane."
 curtiss.422.f: "Aircraft parades were not only a way to demonstrate aerobatics and show the military potential of an air force, but also to showcase technological achievements and engineering feats."
 curtiss.422.g: "Aeronautical inspirations."
 curtiss.423.t: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] at the Aircraft Parade"

 curtiss.423.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('curtiss_airline_tycoon_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] showed up at the aircraft parade with his giant plane and amazed the spectators in attendance."
 curtiss.424.d: "The huge airship amazed spectators at the aircraft parade. People are fascinated by what progress and will can achieve."
 curtiss.423.f: "There is nothing better to convince people of the superiority and greatness of a country than a gigantic aircraft."
 curtiss.423.g: "Fly, darling, fly!"
 curtiss.425.t: "Influencing the Masses"
 curtiss.425.d: "The aircraft parade awakens a remarkable feeling in more and more people. It is an interplay of fascination and fear: on the one hand, the aircraft show the size and strength of our nation, on the other hand, there is a latent desire for destruction inherent in the beauty. Is air superiority a facet of human superiority?"
 curtiss.425.f: "'Aeronautics opened up to men a new field of action, the field of the air. In so doing it of necessity created a new battlefield; for wherever two men meet, conflict is inevitable. In actual fact, aeronautics was widely employed in warfare long before any civilian use was made of it. Still in its infancy at the outbreak of the World War, this new science received then a powerful impetus to military development.' -Giulio Douhet"
 curtiss.425.g: "We are a great country, after all."

 curtiss.431.t: "Aircraft Parade ends"
 curtiss.431.d: "The aircraft parade has come to an end. The impressions will continue to have an impact for a long time and will inspire the spirit of military, civilians and future and current pilots - and teach foreign countries about the greatness of our nation."
 curtiss.431.f: "'Hopefully there will be another air show soon?'"
 curtiss.431.g: "This was an uplifting event."

Prior to the eclipse of July 28, 1851, no properly exposed photograph of the solar corona had yet been produced. For this occasion, the Royal Prussian Observatory at Königsberg commissioned one of the city's most skilled daguerreotypists, Johann Julius Friedrich Berkowski, to record a still image of the event.

The French astronomer Jules Janssen made this observation in India during the total solar eclipse of August 18, 1868. When he announced his discovery, no one initially believed him because no new element had ever been found in space before it was proven on the planet Earth could be guided. On October 20 of the same year, the Englishman Norman Lockyer confirmed that the yellow line was indeed present in the solar spectrum and concluded that it was caused by a previously unknown element. Since this spectral line was very close (1.8 nm from the center) to the Fraunhofer double-D line (D2 = 589.00 nm, D1 = 589.60 nm) of the metal sodium, he named the line D3 to describe it to be distinguished from these lines D1 and D2 of sodium.
