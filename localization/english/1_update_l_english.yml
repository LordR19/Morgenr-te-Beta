 lepsius_anthropology_tech_desc: "Paleoanthropology or simply anthropology is a branch of paleontology and anthropology which seeks to understand the early development of anatomically modern humans, a process known as hominization, through the reconstruction of evolutionary kinship lines within the family Hominidae, working from biological evidence (such as petrified skeletal remains, bone fragments, footprints) and cultural evidence (such as stone tools, artifacts, and settlement localities)."
 lepsius_invented_anthropology_loc: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_anthropologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastNameNoFormatting] is the first scientist to record human bones and skeletons meticulously and very precisely. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_anthropologist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] is seen as the #o pioneer of Anthropology#!."

 je_verrier_astro_physics_reason: "The new physical findings have revolutionized the world of science. Astronomy is not unaffected by this either. Both scientific disciplines are in fruitful exchange and theoretical and observational physics can make their contribution to a better understanding of the universe." #please replace

 verrier_astro_physics_tech_desc: "Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. As one of the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, Astrophysics 'seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space - what they are, rather than where they are'." #Please replace

 verrier_modern_physics_tech: "Modern Physics"
 verrier_modern_physics_tech_desc: "Modern physics is a branch of physics that developed in the early 20th century. Notable branches of modern physics include quantum mechanics, special relativity and general relativity. It is concerned with extreme conditions, such as high velocities that are comparable to the speed of light, small distances comparable to the atomic radius, and very high energies."

 verrier_nuclear_physics_tech: "Nuclear Physics"
 verrier_nuclear_physics_tech_desc: "Nuclear physics is the branch of physics that deals with the structure and behavior of atomic nuclei. Nuclear physics deals with the elucidation of the nuclear structure, i.e. the details of the structure of the atomic nuclei and their reactions. For this purpose, for example, spontaneous transformations of nuclei (radioactivity), scattering processes on nuclei and reactions with nuclei are investigated experimentally and theoretically. Technologies based on nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are based on nuclear physics research."
