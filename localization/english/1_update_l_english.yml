 je_klimt_rossetti: "Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood"
 je_klimt_rossetti_reason: "The Pre-Raphaelites are a group of artists who see a cultural break in the Renaissance art of Raphael and Michelangelo. They prefer Italian painting from the Trecento and Quattrocento. They saw themselves as a reform movement. Their rivalry was less with the actual Renaissance artists than with the neoclassicists who modeled themselves on them. They particularly took up medieval subjects. One of its most famous representatives was Dante Gabriele Rossetti."
 je_klimt_fattori: "Macchiaioli"
 je_klimt_fattori_reason: "The Macchiaioli were a unique Italian artistic group who anticipated innovations in Impressionism, but remained largely unnoticed in their time. The term Macchiaioli is derived from the Italian word macchia, which means spot (a second meaning is scrub, maquis). Their most important representative was Giovanni Fattori."
 je_klimt_barbizon: "The Barbizon School"
 je_klimt_barbizon_reason: "The Barbizon School was formed by a group of French landscape painters towards the end of the first third of the 19th century. The artists stayed in the village of Barbizon near the Fontainebleau Forest. The painter's colony, which was founded by Théodore Rousseau and existed until around 1870, had a significant influence on landscape painting throughout Europe, especially impressionism."
