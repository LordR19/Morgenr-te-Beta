 klimt.1300.t: "Carl Spitzweg, The Poor Poet"
 klimt.1300.d: "The Poor Poet (German: Der arme Poet) is the best known and most popular painting by German painter Carl Spitzweg. It was executed in 1839 and had three versions. It is considered an early masterpiece."
 klimt.1300.f: "Carl Spitzweg was a German romanticist painter and poet. He is considered to be one of the most important artists of the Biedermeier era. His father, a wealthy merchant, had Carl trained as a pharmacist. He attained his qualification from the University of Munich, but while recovering from an illness he also took up painting. Spitzweg was self-taught as an artist, and began by copying the works of Flemish masters. He contributed his first work to satiric magazines. Upon receiving an inheritance in 1833, he was able to dedicate himself to painting. His later paintings and drawings were often humorous genre works. Many of his paintings depict sharply characterized eccentrics."
 klimt.1300.g: "Ahahah, a funny painter!"
 klimt.1300.h: "Wait! Satire against whom?"

From 1836 onwards, the Magnetic Association founded for this purpose and the British Royal Society provided data that he and Wilhelm Weber evaluated. The aim was to measure the fluctuations of the earth's magnetic field in a coordinated manner using numerous measuring stations distributed all over the world. Up to 50 observatories took part in this project, including 35 in Europe, six in Asia, two in Africa, three in North America and four in Oceania.

Together with Weber, he published the results in six volumes under the title 'Results from the Observations of the Magnetic Association'. Maps were published in an additional volume that gave the magnetic data valid at the time for every location on the globe.

The first telegram in the United States was sent by Morse on 11 January 1838, across two miles (3 km) of wire at Speedwell Ironworks near Morristown, New Jersey, although it was only later, in 1844, that he sent the message "WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT" over the 44 miles (71 km) from the Capitol in Washington to the old Mt.

 gaudi.1415.d: "The telegraph station in [SCOPE.sState('gaudi_our_telegraph_state').GetName] has established a connection to the neighboring state of [SCOPE.sState('gaudi_neigbour_telegraph_state').GetName]. We are now able to send a telegram to our neighbor."
 gaudi.1415.f: "Telegraphy can contribute to international understanding and improving relationships. Some telegrams, however, do not."
 gaudi.1415.g: "Send a friendly telegram to strengthen our relations."
 gaudi.1415.h: "Send a joke telegram to annoy their head of state."
 gaudi.1416.t: "Telegram from our Neighbour"
 gaudi.1416.d: "Our neighbor [SCOPE.sCountry('gaudi_telegram_country').GetName] has set up a telegraph line in a neighboring state and sent us a friendly message."
 gaudi.1416.f: "'To good neighbors.'"
 gaudi.1416.g: "A Telegram? For me? We should send one, too!"
 gaudi.1417.d: "The first official telegram from [SCOPE.sCountry('gaudi_telegram_country').GetName] was sent today. Apparently they want to make fools of us!"
 gaudi.1417.f: "'[SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetFullName] has fleas.'"

 je_gaudi_radio_network: "Build a Radio Station Network"
 je_gaudi_radio_network_reason: "Radio stations can be set up anywhere in the country, provided there is already a railway there - it is not necessary to set up a telegraphy network beforehand. It takes around a year to build a new radio station, with an [concept_gaudi_engineer] speeding up the process. Completion is even faster if it is an [concept_gaudi_electrical_engineer]."

 gaudi_radio_network_button: "Wireless Transmissions"
 gaudi_radio_network_button_desc: "The time for annoying tangled cables is over! With the invention of radio technology, messages can now be sent via antenna. This not only makes it possible to exchange news, but also to establish radio programs. Before that, of course, a nationwide network of radio stations needs to be set up."

 gaudi.1421.t: "Radio Network"
 gaudi.1421.d: "The invention of wireless telegraphy makes miracles possible. From now on, messages can be sent from any location to another, without any transmission towers, provided the right technical equipment is available."
 gaudi.1421.f: "In 1897, Karl Ferdinand Braun joined the line of wireless pioneers. His major contributions were the introduction of a closed tuned circuit in the generating part of the transmitter, its separation from the radiating part (the antenna) by means of inductive coupling, and later on the usage of crystals for receiving purposes. Wireless telegraphy claimed Dr. Braun's full attention in 1898, and for many years after that he applied himself almost exclusively to the task of solving its problems. Dr. Braun had written extensively on wireless subjects and was well known through his many contributions to the Electrician and other scientific journals. In 1899, he would apply for the patent Wireless electro transmission of signals over surfaces."
 gaudi.1421.g: "An antenna in every location!"
 gaudi.1422.t: "Radio Network stopped"
 gaudi.1422.d: "Construction work on new antennas and radio stations has been interrupted for the time being. They can be continued at any time with an [concept_gaudi_electrical_engineer]."
 gaudi.1422.f: "'Have I done the world good, or have I added a menace?' -Guglielmo Marconi"
 gaudi.1422.g: "We're finishing construction for now."
 gaudi.1423.t: "Radio Network finished"
 gaudi.1423.d: "The physicists and engineers of [GetPlayer.GetName] proudly announce that they have now covered the entire country - wirelessly!"
 gaudi.1423.f: "'My chief trouble was that the idea was so elementary, so simple in logic that it seemed difficult to believe no one else had thought of putting it in practice.' -Guglielmo Marconi"
 gaudi.1423.g: "Listen to the Radio!"
