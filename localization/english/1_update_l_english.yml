 agassiz_seismology_tech_desc: "In response to a series of earthquakes near Comrie in Scotland in 1839, a committee was formed in the United Kingdom in order to produce better detection methods for earthquakes. The outcome of this was the production of one of the first modern seismometers by James David Forbes. From 1857, Robert Mallet laid the foundation of modern instrumental seismology and carried out seismological experiments using explosives. He is also responsible for coining the word 'seismology'."

The question remains whether the theory is also recognized by the scientific community."
 agassiz.401.f: "From the beginning of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, the determination of the age of the earth remained vague and was, for the most part, subject to repeated debates and hostility. The question of the age of the earth was often related to the question of evolution, because this needed a sufficiently long period of time to function as a theory. Until the turn of the century, many scientists believed that the Earth was only a few million years old - at the end of his life, Lord Kelvin only assumed it was 20 million years old. But even Charles Darwin, who was one of the 'maximalists' who defended his thesis, believed in around 300 million years. It was not until the discovery of radioactivity that the age of the Earth could be correctly determined and the true extent of the age of the Earth (and therefore of the entire solar system) became known."

 agassiz.501.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has just published a book in which he puts forward a thesis that is already highly controversial. Accordingly, the continents in their current form are of more recent geological origin. Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] postulates that today's continents formed a unit he calls 'Pangea'. In order to convince the international geological community of this thesis, he invited them to a congress."
 agassiz.501.f: "The oldest suggestion that continental drift was the cause came from the Flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius. In the 1596 edition of his Atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, the similarity of the two coastlines can already be clearly seen. Alexander von Humboldt described the similarity of the opposite coasts of South America and Africa and their vegetation in 1801 and 1845 and speculated that the Atlantic was washed out by a catastrophic current. In 1858, geographer Antonio Snider-Pellegrini went a step further when he published the first map showing the Old and New Worlds without a separating ocean. However, it was above all Alfred Wegener who, with his theory of continental drift, led to a rethinking from fixism (the thesis that the continents are firmly rooted in the earth) to mobilism. During his lifetime, however, his explanation model remained a minority opinion in science, which only became established in the second half of the 20th century."

But the opponents are numerous and do not want to deviate from the prevailing doctrine of fixism."
 agassiz.504.f: "Fixism was the key geotectonic hypothesis until the 1960s. It was assumed that the earth's crust was firmly connected to the subsoil, so that large-scale tectonic processes were local. From this it followed that the development of the earth was predominantly characterized by vertical and very little by horizontal tectonic movements of the earth's crust. Most theories of classical geology were based on the idea of fixism. At the beginning of the 10th century, fossils of the same species were found in South America and Africa. Under the assumption of fixism, the land bridge hypothesis was put forward, according to which there were once land bridges connecting Africa to South America, allowing animals to migrate to the other continent. Through the echo sounder measurements of the research ship Meteor between 1924 and 1927, during which the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - an undersea mountain range that runs from north to south - was discovered and not, as expected, the remnants of a land bridge that should have run from east to west, the land bridge hypothesis began to falter but was not completely abandoned until the 1960s. The opposite of fixism is mobilism, which sees horizontal movements of the earth's crust as having a decisive influence. The theory of mobilism developed from Alfred Wegener's discovery of continental drift."
