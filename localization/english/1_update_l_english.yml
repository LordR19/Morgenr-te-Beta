 klimt.1300.t: "Carl Spitzweg, The Poor Poet"
 klimt.1300.d: "The Poor Poet (German: Der arme Poet) is the best known and most popular painting by German painter Carl Spitzweg. It was executed in 1839 and had three versions. It is considered an early masterpiece."
 klimt.1300.f: "Carl Spitzweg was a German romanticist painter and poet. He is considered to be one of the most important artists of the Biedermeier era. His father, a wealthy merchant, had Carl trained as a pharmacist. He attained his qualification from the University of Munich, but while recovering from an illness he also took up painting. Spitzweg was self-taught as an artist, and began by copying the works of Flemish masters. He contributed his first work to satiric magazines. Upon receiving an inheritance in 1833, he was able to dedicate himself to painting. His later paintings and drawings were often humorous genre works. Many of his paintings depict sharply characterized eccentrics."
 klimt.1300.g: "Ahahah, a funny painter!"
 klimt.1300.h: "Wait! Satire against whom?"

 je_gaudi_magnetic_observation_reason: "Carl Friedrich Gauß built the first geophysical observatory in Göttingen and constructed a sensitive magnetometer for it in 1832. He realized that globally distributed measurements would have to be carried out at the same time in order to be able to localize the causes of the fluctuations and measure the static field more precisely. From 1836 onwards, the Magnetic Association founded for this purpose and the British Royal Society provided data that he and Wilhelm Weber evaluated. The aim was to measure the fluctuations of the earth's magnetic field in a coordinated manner using numerous measuring stations distributed all over the world. Up to 50 observatories took part in this project, including 35 in Europe, six in Asia, two in Africa, three in North America and four in Oceania. The results were delivered to Göttingen and scientifically processed by Gauß and Weber."

 gaudi.1403.d: "After years of collecting and comparing geomagnetic data from all over the world, the researchers in Göttingen were able to come to an interesting result."
 gaudi.1403.f: "In 1839, Gauss was able to show that the majority of the Earth's static magnetic field comes from within the Earth, while smaller, short-term variations in the Earth's magnetic field come from outside. Together with Weber, he published the results in six volumes under the title 'Results from the Observations of the Magnetic Association'. Maps were published in an additional volume that gave the magnetic data valid at the time for every location on the globe. Lines connected the points of the same declination, the same inclination and the same field strength. This publication represented a milestone in the history of natural sciences."

 gaudi.1405.f: "There can be a variety of reasons why the earth's magnetic field is different in one place than elsewhere. Such incidents often gave rise to the assumption that a large metal deposit could be located at the site, which is why geomagnetic research was not uninteresting for mining."
