 je_dufour_carte_dufour: "Topographic Map of Switzerland"
 je_dufour_carte_dufour_reason: "Since 1822 land surveying is a matter for the Swiss Confederation and not the Cantons. General Dufour was commissioned to carry out the survey of Switzerland according to uniform standards and to record the survey results on a map. This will take a long time and cost a bit, but it will help to further develop Switzerland."

 dufour.900.f: "Finally you can see the first print of the Carte Dufour. Fine lines show mountains, cities, even houses. Never before existed such a precise map of Switzerland!\n\n#b Historically #! Dufour and his team worked on the map from 1832 until 1865. The first two sheets were published in 1845 and the last of the 25 sheets was published in 1865. The topographic map was printed using a engraving print process and showed a scale of 1:100,000. Interestingly Dufour was the first general of modern Switzerland and lead the Swiss army against the Sonderbund in the Swiss civil war (Sonderbundskrieg) in 1848.\n\n#b Today #! the Carte Dufour is located at the Schweizer Landesmuseum in Zürich. But you can actually find the map online as it was published with many other national maps of Switzerland."

 dufour.903.d: "Our Surveyors nearly got lost in [SCOPE.sState('dufour_mapping_scope').GetName], but a few locals were able to help them and even offered a place to stay and information on the fastest paths. This will surely help the map to get finished faster!"

 ### Manzoni ###

 manzoni_italian_irredenta_decision: "Italia irredenta"
 manzoni_italian_irredenta_decision_desc: "Historically, Dalmatia, the Ionian Islands, Malta and Corsica were parts of the italian motherland. Corsica belonged to Genoa, Malta to Sicily and Dalmatia and the Ionian Islands were part of the Republic of Venice. Italian communities still exist in these areas. After the glorious unification of Italy and the great progress we have made, it is time to redeem the last italian territories, which are still under foreign rule. A last time we should cry: Va fuori, stranier'!"

 united_italian: "Italian"
 je_manzoni_italianization: "Italianization"
 je_manzoni_italianization_reason: "After the unification of Italy, Massimo d'Azeglio said that 'We have made Italy, now we must make Italians'. Even if the saying is historically questionable, it still brings to the point the truth that after Italy's political unification, internal unity was anything but stable. This doesn't just apply to the south, where the brigands were up to mischief - even in the north, outside of the bourgeois elite, most people still felt connected to their regional identity. Joint wars, a national education system, joint military service and the construction of national institutions such as barracks, military ports and administrative facilities are likely to ensure that a significantly stronger all-Italian identity emerges from the arduous process of national unity in the next few years."
 manzoni_italian_consiousness_capital_tt: "The local northern Italian and southern Italian populations of our capital state become one Italian population. It will be transformed into an Italian homeland. Our primary culture will change to Italian and we will be able to italianize the whole country."
 je_manzoni_italianization_goal: "#O Italianization Progress#! reaches #G 200#!."

 je_manzoni_italian_national_identity: "Italian Identity"
 je_manzoni_italian_national_identity_reason: "After a few years of growing together and a few reforms, the feeling of being connected to a pan-Italian identity is increasingly spreading among the general population. This feeling will spread from region to region, no matter how the state sets the right framework: regions that are well served by government administrations, universities, barracks or naval bases are more likely to develop an all-Italian identity due to their integrative function. Heavily urbanized areas are more likely to find access to a concept that was previously only researched by intellectuals. Under perfect circumstances, one sub-state could adopt the new identity every year. If all Italians in the nation state feel like they are, this will also have an influence on the Italians abroad, who will then increasingly feel like our countrymen abroad rather than as Lombards, Sicilians or Tuscans."

 manzoni.911.t: "Italian consciousness in [SCOPE.sState('united_italian_culture_state').GetName]"
 manzoni.911.d: "After years of social and political influence, the population in [SCOPE.sState('united_italian_culture_state').GetName] has developed a sense of belonging with the entire Italian peninsula. They are now fully committed to the pan-Italian identity."
 manzoni.911.f: "'The Italians wanted to create a new Italy, and to remain the old Italians of before, with the apprehensions and moral miseries that were their heritage from ancient times; because they think about reforming Italy, and no one realizes that to achieve this they must first reform themselves. -Massimo d'Azeglio"
 manzoni.911.g: "The old Dream of Machiavelli becomes reality!"
 manzoni_italian_consiousness_tt: "The local northern Italian and southern Italian populations become an Italian population. Northern Italian and southern Italian homelands will be transformed into Italian homelands."
 manzoni.912.t: "A Pan-Italian Consciousness"
 manzoni.912.d: "Now that the entire population of Italy no longer sees itself primarily as belonging to its regional identity but to its national identity, this has an impact not only on Italians at home but also across the world."
 manzoni.912.f: "With the establishment of the Italian national state and the enforcement of the pan-Italian identity, those Italians outside the borders - whether as emigrants in the world or originally living under foreign rule - will also identify themselves primarily as Italians."
 manzoni.912.g: "We've made the Italians!"
 manzoni_pan_italian_identity_tt: "Worldwide, all northern Italian and southern Italian populations will now identify themselves as a pan-Italian population. Northern Italian and Southern Italian homelands will only be Italian homelands worldwide."
 manzoni.913.d: "Now that the entire population of Italy no longer sees itself primarily as belonging to its regional identity but to its national identity, this has an impact not only on Italians at home but also across the world. In our country, too, there is now an urge to identify as Italian, instead of just referring to regional origins, as was previously the case."
 manzoni.913.g: "Are you saying that there are no differences between a Sicilian fisherman and a Trentino shepherd?"
