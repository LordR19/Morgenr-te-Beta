 concept_curtiss_tourism_desc: "Tourism provides a culturally superior nation with additional income. Unique monuments, museums and art galleries, archaeological sites, centers of art as well as high values in the various cultural traditions are factors that make a nation an attractive tourist destination. Laws that increase freedom of movement and economic activity also contribute to higher tourism income. The infrastructure also plays a crucial role - after all, remote places cannot be reached. An airport in particular revolutionizes tourism and provides a significant increase in revenue."

The first completed illustrations are incomparably beautiful and have thrilled [SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_writer_scope').GetLastName]."
 manzoni.801.f: "\"This is a magnificient illustration! I wonder if the artist hid any small details that will tell us more about the story?\""
 manzoni.801.g: "The details are incredible!"

 manzoni.802.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_writer_scope').GetFullName], a Science Fiction Writer and our Astronomer Dr. [SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_astronomer_scope').GetLastName] have met to discuss the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Together they made assumptions about what this life might look like and where it might be possible. They published their theories as the [SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_astronomer_scope').GetLastName]-[SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_writer_scope').GetLastName]-Hypothesis."
 manzoni.802.f: "\"Obviously these creatures would live in the gaseous oceans of a Gas Giant. I would assume that they couldn't communicate with the outside world, but what if they would find a way which would allow them to colonize new Gas Giants? We might even see a revolution in one of those colonies!\""
 manzoni.802.g: "Maybe we should search for extraterrestials?"
 manzoni.802.h: "They should write a book about their theories!"

 manzoni.1307.t: "\"Buddenbrooks: Verfall einer Familie\""
 manzoni.1307.d: "\"Buddenbrooks: Verfall einer Familie\" or \"Buddenbrooks: The Decline of a Family\" is the first social novel in the German language. In it, [SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_writer_scope').GetFullName] describes the decline of a wealthy merchant family over four generations in the Hanseatic city of Lübeck."
 manzoni.1307.f: "\"Often, the outward and visible material signs and symbols of happiness and success only show themselves when the process of decline has already set in.

A total of 89 stories, separated into two books, Upper and Lower, the collection includes tales of great peoples, scenic travels, hístorical relics, and even local legends. The Records provide a unique view into the life in Viet Nam during the tumultuous era of the late Later Le and early Nguyen dynasties."
 manzoni.2100.f: "From Ly, Tran, Le, Trinh to this date, after hundreds of years, there are stories neither documented by official historians nor remembered by local legends; thus both men decided to collect them in the realm of sorrowful changes. Should they both consider these tales sorrowful and thus elected to forget, then they would sooner or later be forgotten. Fortunately, by penning these stories, they can serve as the raft delivering us from the delirious shore, as the light illuminating the dark, named Tang Thương Ngẫu Lục - Arbitrary Records of Sorrow, the meaning may thus be perceived."
 manzoni.2100.g: "Tales of a darker time, we must strive to be better."
