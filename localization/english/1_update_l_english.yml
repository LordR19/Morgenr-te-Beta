 dubois.271.d: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] today invited a group of colleagues to visit the new Prehistoric Scenery. The academics praised [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] sense of detail."
 dubois.271.f_cretaceous: "The climate in the Cretaceous was generally warm and balanced. It enabled some dinosaurs to reach high southern and northern latitudes, at least during the summer months. The poles were ice-free and the sea level was correspondingly very high, reaching its maximum value in the Lower Turonian. It was only at the end of the Cretaceous in the Maastrichtian that cooling and a marked regression occurred. As in the preceding Jurassic period, the terrestrial macrofauna and megafauna were dominated by dinosaurs. In the Lower Cretaceous, club moss plants, ferns, tree ferns, ginkgoales, Bennettitales, and conifers were the predominant plants. In the Upper Cretaceous, many deciduous trees such as maple, oak and walnut competed with conifers such as Sequoia and Geinitzia. Grasses spread across the mainland and greatly changed erosion behavior."
 dubois.271.f_jurassic: "The Lower Jurassic period may have ended with massive eruptions in a large magmatic province on Gondwana. This led to global warming, coupled with a second-order mass extinction. Small-leaved, drought-adapted conifers then became an important part of the flora and modern sauropods developed among the dinosaurs. The Jurassic period, especially the late Jurassic period (Upper Jurassic), saw the first heyday of dinosaurs, with large theropods such as Allosaurus and giant sauropods such as Diplodocus and Giraffatitan. The flora was dominated by the gymnosperms (including the coniferous plants such as sequoias and pines, but also ginkgo trees and cycads). The Jurassic is also known as the age of cycads because they were very common. Ferns and horsetails formed the understory of the forests."
 dubois.271.f_triassic: "During the Triassic, a warm climate prevailed almost continuously, although this was subject to strong fluctuations at the beginning of the period. The climate also seems to have been rather dry worldwide: The reason was the shape of the supercontinent Pangea and a resulting monsoon effect. There were probably extensive deserts inland. The turn from the Permian to the Triassic is associated with a pronounced faunal change. This is so drastic that, due to the significantly changed fossil record, the turn from the Permian to the Triassic is not only the boundary between two periods, but also between two eras of earth's history, the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic. As a result, numerous groups of marine invertebrates disappear completely or permanently from the fossil record. The terrestrial vertebrate fauna is also undergoing significant changes. The change in the plant world from ferns to gymnosperms that had already taken place in the Permian continued in the Triassic."
 dubois.271.g: "Beautiful!"

 dubois.272.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] shows remarkable perfectionism in completing his prehistoric scenery. That's why [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe]'s already used up his entire budget."
 dubois.272.f: "Was it the dinosaur egg specially ordered for the exhibition? The exquisite seeds? Or the tip of 300 pounds that the porter received for the natural earth? For whatever reasons Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] can hardly explain, the money just flows through his hands."
 dubois.272.g: "More money for some artificial plants and lizards? Forget it!"
 dubois.272.h: "We want a beautiful diorama, spare no expense!"
 dubois.273.t: "A ridiculous job?"
 dubois.273.d: "Some academic 'colleagues' mock Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] because of [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] obsession with prehistoric scenery not only behind [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] back, but now quite directly. Some researchers consider [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] activity an absurd hobby and the project a fundamentally ridiculous affair."
 dubois.273.f: "'The extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology.' -Søren Kierkegaard"
 dubois.273.g: "Paleontology is a serious science!"
 dubois.273.h: "Admittedly, our paleontologist is a bit quirky."
 dubois.273.i: "Buy those nasty scholars a few bottles of sherry so they'll leave the doctor alone."
 dubois.274.t: "Student Interest"
 dubois.274.d: "For a few weeks now, students at the university have been watching with growing interest where Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] is building a prehistoric scenery. What some consider to be a quirky undertaking, others see as inspiration - suddenly the distant past becomes tangible."
 dubois.274.f: "Dinosaur Court in Crystal Palace Park in south London is a geological and paleontological theme park. It is known for the animal sculptures, which were created by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins in the middle of the 19th century as the world's first life-size figurative representations of extinct animals. The park was intended to serve both the amusement and education of its Victorian visitors. On the islands of the lake in the part of the complex designed as an English landscape garden, a theme park was designed that reflected the geological history of Britain. According to a concept based on the geologist David Thomas Ansted, each of the three islands was assigned to an era of the Phanerozoic and was designed with the sediments that originated in that period. Hawkins was advised by paleontologist Richard Owen. Although the prehistoric animals no longer corresponded to the state of research in the same century, they aroused great interest and provided large parts of the population with a basic level of paeontological knowledge."
 dubois.274.g: "A new generation of scholars!"
 dubois.274.h: "They should help the Doctor."
