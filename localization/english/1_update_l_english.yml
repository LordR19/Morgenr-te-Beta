 #Verrier 9022: Pułtusk meteor fall happens
 verrier.9020.t: "The Pułtusk meteor shower"
 verrier.9020.d: "People in Mazowia witnessed something in the sky"
 verrier.9020.f: "Nestled in the heart of Mazowia, the quaint town of Pułtusk holds a secret from the cosmos. It was here, on a cold winter's day, that a celestial event of unprecedented magnitude unfolded, forever linking this peaceful settlement with the vast, mysterious universe beyond. The year was 1868. On January 30th, the residents of Pułtusk went about their daily routines, unaware that their lives were about to intersect with an extraordinary phenomenon. As the afternoon gave way to the evening, an unusual silence fell over the town. Without warning, a brilliant light pierced the sky. A fireball, more radiant than the sun, blazed across the heavens. Witnesses described it as a blazing orb, trailing a luminous tail, splitting the sky with a thunderous roar. The fireball, later identified as a meteorite, fragmented explosively as it entered Earth's atmosphere. Thousands of pieces rained down over Pułtusk and its surrounding areas, creating a shower of meteoritic stones. This event became known as the Pułtusk meteorite shower."

 verrier.9022.d: "People in Arizona witnessed something in the sky"
 verrier.9022.f: "As night fell over Holbrook, the sky erupted in a cascade of radiant fireballs around 7:15 PM. Hundreds of luminous meteors, varying in size and brilliance, streaked across the heavens, originating from a single point and dispersing in all directions. These meteors, leaving trails of bright white and glowing yellow light, created an awe-inspiring display. Larger fragments, with fiery cores, disintegrated into smaller pieces before vanishing in the lower atmosphere. Distant cannon-like sounds echoed, reflecting the immense energy of their fragmentation. Residents, initially startled, soon gathered to marvel at the celestial spectacle. A subsequent search uncovered numerous small meteorite fragments scattered across the landscape, primarily composed of iron and nickel.
