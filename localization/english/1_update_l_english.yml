 curtiss_airplane_speed_record_modifier: "Airplane Speed Record"
 curtiss_testplane_cost_modifier: "Test Aircraft Construction"

 je_curtiss_testplane_build: "Test Aircraft Construction"
 je_curtiss_testplane_build_reason: "The capabilities of a test aircraft depend primarily on the experience of an aeronautical engineer and the technologies researched. Technologies that have a critical impact on aircraft capabilities include #O Modern Physics#!, #O Arc Welding#!, #O Seaplanes#! and #O Modern Aviation#!. In order to get the most out of an aircraft, you need a pilot whose experience also has a direct influence on the maximum speed."
 je_curtiss_testplane_build_goal: "Building a new aircraft takes about a year."

The New Record is [GetGlobalVariable('curtiss_airplane_speed_record_global_var').GetValue|V0] km/h."

 curtiss.60.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_cook_scope').GetFullName] founded our country's first tourism company and is therefore considered to have laid the foundations for the local industry. The income is minimal, but the more interesting a country is, the more guests it can hope for."
 curtiss.60.f: "Tourism provides a culturally superior nation with additional income. Unique monuments, museums and art galleries, archaeological sites, centers of art as well as high values in the various cultural traditions are factors that make a nation an attractive tourist destination. Laws that increase freedom of movement and economic activity also contribute to higher tourism income. The infrastructure also plays a crucial role - after all, remote places cannot be reached. An airport in particular revolutionizes tourism and provides a significant increase in revenue."
 curtiss.60.g: "Tourists pay for art and culture?"

 curtiss.701.d3: "The mechanical genius of [ROOT.Var('gaudi_engineer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] and the outstanding flying skills of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_pilot_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] achieved something groundbreaking: not only did the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_testplane_nick_name')] manage to break the national speed record of #b #p [ROOT.Var('curtiss_airplane_speed_record_var').GetValue] km/h#!, but also the world speed record of #b #p [GetGlobalVariable('curtiss_airplane_speed_record_global_var').GetValue]#! km/h by [GetGlobalVariable('curtiss_airplane_speed_record_holder_global_var').GetCountry.GetFlagTextIcon].

 curtiss.701.f3: "If I have made a mistake in the design, then I'm the one who should pay for it. I certainly would not ask somebody else to fly a plane if I were afraid to do it myself." -Howard Hughes"
 curtiss.701.g: "Was it the plane or the pilot?"
 curtiss.701.h: "That was satisfactory, but not enough."
 curtiss.701.i: "Wonderful! Congratulations!"

 curtiss.702.t: "Speed Flight ends in Catastrophe"
 curtiss.702.d: "The pursuit of a speed record ends in tragedy.

The [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_testplane_nick_name')] dragged [SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_pilot_scope').GetHerHim] to a fiery death. The entire air crew is in shock."
