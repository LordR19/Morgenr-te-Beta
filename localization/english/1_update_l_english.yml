 mendelejew.101.t: "Theory of a New Element"
 mendelejew.101.d: "After extensive studies and investigations, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] postulated that there must still be an unknown element. The chemist calls this hypothetical #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_thought_variable').GetValue|0]#!. However, it still awaits discovery."
 mendelejew.101.f: "The term chemical element arose in the 17th century when it was increasingly recognized that the concept of elements in alchemy was unsuitable for a scientific explanation of the diverse properties of substances and their reactions with one another. Robert Boyle published an influential critique of the inadequacies of alchemy in 1661 called 'The Sceptical Chymist'. In it he explained that by chemical elements one should understand those primitive substances 'which have neither arisen from other substances nor from each other, but which form the components of which mixed substances are made'."
 mendelejew.101.g: "But hey, that's just a theory. A chemist's theory!"
 mendelejew.102.t: "A missing Element?"
 mendelejew.102.d: "In his recent research, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has determined that, given current knowledge, there must be other unknown elements. It is still unknown how exactly these can be determined, but a hypothesis should soon be formulated."
 mendelejew.102.f: "The term 'elements' (stoicheia) was first used by Greek philosopher Plato around 360 BCE in his dialogue Timaeus, which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a speculative treatise on chemistry. Plato believed the elements introduced a century earlier by Empedocles were composed of small polyhedral forms: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air), icosahedron (water), and cube (earth)."
 mendelejew.102.g: "How can something be missing that you don't know exists?"
 mendelejew.103.t: "Foreign Nation theorizes New Element"
 mendelejew.103.d: "To our chief chemist's regret, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] discovered today that a scientific article would be published in a foreign magazine that put forward a hypothesis about #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_thought_variable').GetValue|0]#! that Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHrselfHimselfe] wanted to theorize about. All research was stopped."

 mendelejew.111.t: "An absent Professor?"
 mendelejew.111.d: "[ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] is not only considered an excellent researcher but also a gifted teacher. However, the current obligations in the course of element research cause problems in the curriculum. There are already complaints that seminars and lectures are being neglected."
 mendelejew.111.f: "The German chemistry professor Justus von Liebig was particularly popular among his students because of his modern learning methods. His discoveries and writings soon made him known worldwide, with the result that, in addition to many Germans, numerous foreigners, including 84 English and 18 Americans, came to Giessen to hear Liebig's lectures on chemistry and pharmacy."

 mendelejew.111.i: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] should find a balance."
 mendelejew.112.t: "A Dream"
 mendelejew.112.d: "[ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] tells of an inspiring dream at night that led him to being able to solve a theoretical chemical problem that he had previously failed at."
 mendelejew.112.f: "'I was sitting writing on my textbook, but the work did not progress; my thoughts were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire and dozed. Again the atoms were gamboling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by the repeated visions of the kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold conformation; long rows sometimes more closely fitted together all twining and twisting in snake-like motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and this time also I spent the rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth ... but let us beware of publishing our dreams before they have been put to the proof by the waking understanding.' -August Kekulé"
 mendelejew.112.g: "Are you saying that the Doctor even works in his sleep?"
 mendelejew.113.t: "Treatise on Chemistry"
 mendelejew.113.d: "As a side study to the actual theory regarding an unknown element, a treatise on chemistry was created. Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has so far only intended it for private use, but an assistant insists that it should be completed and published instead of just seeing it as a sketch."
 mendelejew.113.f: "Not only in chemistry, but in almost every academic discipline, it can happen that the research result actually sought is not achieved, but on the way there are much more interesting discoveries that are only recorded through hasty writing. It can often happen that the goal is briefly lost in order to devote oneself to something more groundbreaking."
 mendelejew.113.g: "This is just for a private research."
 mendelejew.113.h: "This study should be taught in the courses."
 mendelejew.113.i: "This publication is of scientific value - it should be publicly available!"
 mendelejew.114.t: "Daydreaming"
 mendelejew.114.d: "Our chemist, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName], pointed out that [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] needed special rest and opportunities for retreat, especially inspiring sleep, in order to successfully complete [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] research. However, not much has happened since then."
 mendelejew.114.f: "'If all the hypotheses are true, and this chemical formula is valid, then there should be... oh, a squirrel!'"
 mendelejew.114.g: "The chemist was just lazing around the whole time?!"
 mendelejew.115.t: "An Astronomical-Chemical Collaboration"
 mendelejew.115.d: "An exchange of ideas with the astronomer Dr. [ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] gave our chemist Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] groundbreaking impulses in [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] theorizing of a new element."
 mendelejew.115.f: "Even before the discovery of spectroscopy, but especially after, chemistry and astronomy continued to influence each other. Spectroscopy was initially used as an astronomical technique with experiments by William Hyde Wollaston, who built the first spectrometer to display the spectral lines of the sun's rays. These spectral lines were later characterized by Josef von Fraunhofer. Later, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen discovered that each chemical element was associated with a specific number and arrangement of spectral lines. They concluded from this that the lines observed by Wollaston and Fraunhofer were due to the absorption properties of these elements in the upper layers of the sun and that these must therefore also be present in the photosphere."
 mendelejew.115.g: "An academic synthesis!"

 mendelejew.201.t: "Discovery of a New Element"
 mendelejew.201.d: "It took arduous hours and sifting through a tiring amount of material, but Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] is now certain: if the last investigations are correct, then he has actually discovered the long-sought #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#!. This is a truly great day for our country!"
 mendelejew.201.f: "'We must expect the discovery of many yet unknown elements, for example, elements analogous to aluminium and silicon, whose atomic weight would be between 65 and 75.' -Dmitri Mendeleev"
 mendelejew.201.g: "And what does it taste like?"
 mendelejew.202.t: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName]'s Search for #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#!"
 mendelejew.202.d: "Our chief chemist, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], is firmly of the opinion that the postulated #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#! actually exists and has decided to find it."
 mendelejew.202.f: "Of the elements in today's sense, only ten elements were known in their pure form in ancient times, which either occurred naturally or could be smelted from ore: carbon, sulfur, iron, copper, zinc, silver, tin, gold, mercury and lead. In the course of medieval mining history, small amounts of admixtures of unknown metals were discovered in ores, especially in the Ore Mountains, and were named after mountain spirits (cobalt, nickel). The discovery of phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand finally ushered in the age of discovery of most elements, including uranium from pitchblende by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1789."
 mendelejew.202.g: "Elementary research."
 mendelejew.203.t: "Foreign Nation discovers New Element"
 mendelejew.203.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] learned today at a conference that a foreign chemist managed to discover #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#! first. Demotivated by the news, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] stopped all research."
 mendelejew.203.f: "'I tried out various experiments described in treatises on physics and chemistry, and the results were sometimes unexpected. At times, I would be encouraged by a little unhoped-for success; at others, I would be in the deepest despair because of accidents and failures resulting from my inexperience.' -Marie Curie"
 mendelejew.203.g: "We have to prove that this is a false element!"

 mendelejew.211.t: "A new Laboratory?"
 mendelejew.211.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] complains that the chemical laboratory at his university is in poor condition. There is an urgent need to purchase new instruments and equipment. Otherwise, the discovery of new elements could be significantly delayed."
 mendelejew.211.f: "Setting up laboratories and purchasing new equipment or instruments was anything but a given. In many places, chemistry was still viewed negatively at the beginning of the 19th century. Despite his important rank, the chemist Justus von Liebig even had to pay for his laboratory equipment himself."
 mendelejew.211.g: "Fund a new laboratory with state-of-the-art equipment."
 mendelejew.211.h: "Make savings at the university to purchase new instruments."
 mendelejew.211.i: "And who is going to finance all of this?"
 mendelejew.212.t: "Unknown Chemical Compound"
 mendelejew.212.d: "During his efforts to finally discover #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#!, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has discovered a previously unknown chemical compound that could have practical benefits for industry."
 mendelejew.212.f: "A chemical compound is a chemical substance composed of many identical molecules (or molecular entities) containing atoms from more than one chemical element held together by chemical bonds. A molecule consisting of atoms of only one element is therefore not a compound. A compound can be transformed into a different substance by a chemical reaction, which may involve interactions with other substances. In this process, bonds between atoms may be broken or new bonds formed."
 mendelejew.212.g: "Great!"
 mendelejew.213.t: "Chemical Assistant"
 mendelejew.213.d: "In his search for the still undiscovered #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#!, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] gets helpful support from a talented assistant. Some colleagues think that he is even too good to work as a mere assistant."
 mendelejew.213.f: "'I was simply entranced by chemical phenomena, by the reactions in which substances, often with strikingly different properties, appear; and I hoped to learn more and more about this aspect of the world.' -Linus Pauling"
 mendelejew.213.g: "The assistant should focus on element research."
 mendelejew.213.h: "Encourage this scientific talent."
 mendelejew.214.t: "Bad Samples"
 mendelejew.214.d: "As it turns out, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] worked with impure samples for months and therefore derived false results from them."
 mendelejew.214.f: "'What do you mean it's just discolored quartz?!'"
 mendelejew.214.g: "A scientific setback."
 mendelejew.215.t: "A Geological-Chemical Collaboration"
 mendelejew.215.d: "An exchange of ideas with the geologist Dr. [ROOT.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] gave our chemist Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] groundbreaking impulses for the discovery of a new element."
 mendelejew.215.f: "Without new minerals that geologists have cataloged, the discovery of many chemical elements would not have been possible. In 1839, the German-Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein coined the term geochemistry. It is based on the concept of not only describing minerals, but also understanding the material basis and the chemical dynamics behind them."

 mendelejew.301.t: "Isolation of a New Element"
 mendelejew.301.d: "There is no longer any doubt: the #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#! not only exists, it can also be isolated using modern chemical methods. Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has decided to name the element #YELLOW [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('mendelejew_element_name')]#!."
 mendelejew.301.f: "'In nature nothing is created, nothing is lost, everything changes. We must trust to nothing but facts: These are presented to us by Nature, and cannot deceive.' -Antoine Lavoisier"
 mendelejew.301.g: "A triumph of science."
 mendelejew.302.t: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName]'s Examination of #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#!"
 mendelejew.302.d: "Although #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#! is considered 'discovered', its existence has not yet been verified until it can be isolated. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has decided to examine the element more closely, to check it and finally to make it accessible in its pure form."
 mendelejew.302.f: "The first modern list of elements was given in Antoine Lavoisier's 1789 Elements of Chemistry, which contained 33 elements, including light and caloric. By 1818, Jöns Jacob Berzelius had determined atomic weights for 45 of the 49 then-accepted elements. Dmitri Mendeleev had 63 elements in his periodic table of 1869."
 mendelejew.302.g: "I hope the lab is insured."
 mendelejew.202.g: "Elementary research."
 mendelejew.303.t: "Foreign Nation isolates New Element"
 mendelejew.303.d: "Bad news! It looks like a foreign chemist has isolated #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#!. All the efforts and hopes that Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName]'s investments are in vain. Maybe we can explore another element?"
 mendelejew.303.f: "'It's the right idea, but not the right time. If I have succeeded better than many who surround me, it has been chiefly - may I say almost solely - from universal assiduity.' -John Dalton"
 mendelejew.303.g: "This scientific glory should have been ours..."

 mendelejew.311.t: "Chemical Synthesis"
 mendelejew.311.d: "During his attempts to isolate the #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#!, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] succeeded in a synthesis that was previously considered technically very demanding. This will benefit the economy and industry as well as science."
 mendelejew.311.f: "Chemical synthesis (chemical combination) is the artificial execution of chemical reactions to obtain one or several products. This occurs by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions. In modern laboratory uses, the process is reproducible and reliable. A chemical synthesis involves one or more compounds (known as reagents or reactants) that will experience a transformation when subjected to certain conditions. Various reaction types can be applied to formulate a desired product. This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel, such as a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask. Many reactions require some form of processing or purification procedure to isolate the final product"
 mendelejew.311.g: "Great."
 mendelejew.312.t: "Chemical Dissociation"
 mendelejew.312.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has made progress in his attempts to isolate #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#!. A chemical dissociation took him a decisive step further."
 mendelejew.312.f: "Dissociation in chemistry is a general process in which molecules (or ionic compounds such as salts, or complexes) separate or split into other things such as atoms, ions, or radicals, usually in a reversible manner. For instance, when an acid dissolves in water, a covalent bond between an electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom is broken by heterolytic fission, which gives a proton (H+) and a negative ion. Dissociation is the opposite of association or recombination."
 mendelejew.312.g: "Fantastic!"

 mendelejew.313.d: "It is no secret that [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] uses his current research assignment regarding the isolation of #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#! as an excuse to avoid his remaining unpleasant academic obligations. The rector has now called him to account because he does not appear at university meetings or lectures."
 mendelejew.313.f: "No excuse is too great to stay away from the annoying creatures that generally bear the title of 'students'."
 mendelejew.313.g: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has more important things to do."
 mendelejew.313.h: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] must fulfill his other obligations."
 mendelejew.314.t: "An unforeseen Chemical Reaction"
 mendelejew.314.d: "During one of his last chemical experiments, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] apparently misinterpreted a few small things and thus slightly underestimated the effect of a reaction."
 mendelejew.314.f: "The newspapers are still reporting on the failed fire brigade operation, whose use of water fueled the chemical reaction even more instead of reducing the damage. Several students complained of smoke inhalation, and there were several injuries in the laboratory. The university building in the Faculty of Science has suffered significant damage and will have to be closed for months, if not years. The local newspaper was awaiting a statement from Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName], who, however, could not be reached after his short-term hospital stay due to a tennis tournament."
 mendelejew.314.g: "A disaster!"
 mendelejew.315.t: "An Ingenious-Chemical Collaboration"
 mendelejew.315.d: "The engineer Dr. [ROOT.Var('gaudi_engineer_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has improved some scientific equipment to assist Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] in the planned isolation of an element."
 mendelejew.315.f: "At the beginning of the 20th century, chemists and mechanical engineers worked together in the chemical industry, e.g. in the design of reactors and boilers, some of which were exposed to considerable stress (600 °C and 100 bar). The new discipline of chemical engineering ultimately developed at this interface, whose graduates today dominate the chemical industry."

 mendelejew.401.t: "A Chemical Experiment"
 mendelejew.401.d: "In order to take a break from his usual work,  Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] wants to use the space in the country's most important laboratory to carry out a chemical experiment. The experimental glasses are already ready."
 mendelejew.401.f: "From time to time, chemists come up with the idea of pursuing their passion instead of the tasks assigned to them. Every now and then, valuable findings actually emerge: for example, the improvement of fertilizers or the production of chemicals in industry. Whether such success occurs depends largely on the character traits, skills and experience of a chemist."
 mendelejew.401.g: "I'm excited to see what comes out of this experiment!"
 mendelejew.401.h: "Stop this nonsense."
 mendelejew.402.t: "Successful experiment"
 mendelejew.402.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was right and actually gained useful knowledge from his latest experiment.

 mendelejew.402.f3: "The new process that [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has made accessible to industry should significantly improve production in chemical factories."

 mendelejew.403.d: "Although his colleagues had high hopes for [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s work, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] experiment was not successful. Instead, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] lost valuable time that would have been better spent on element research."
 mendelejew.403.f: "'Well, that didn't work as expected. At least the laboratory didn't explode!'"

 je_nationalization_italianization_reason: "After the unification of Italy, Massimo d'Azeglio said that 'We have made Italy, now we must make Italians'. Even if the saying is historically questionable, it still brings to the point the truth that after Italy's political unification, internal unity was anything but stable. This doesn't just apply to the south, where the brigands were up to mischief - even in the north, outside of the bourgeois elite, most people still felt connected to their regional identity. Joint wars, high prestige, the construction of national institutions such as universities, art academies or administrative facilities are likely to ensure that a significantly stronger all-Italian identity emerges from the arduous process of national unity in the next few years."
 je_nationalization_italianization_goal: "#O National Identity Progress#! reaches #G 250#!."

 je_nationalization_germanization_reason: "After the founding of the German Empire in 1871, the Germans' sense of unity was already very widespread in the various federal states. The urgent need to unify the German states had existed since 1848. Only in Bavaria did a specific regional feeling prevail until well into the 20th century, but this was increasingly pushed back. Joint wars, high prestige, the construction of national institutions such as universities, art academies or administrative facilities are likely to ensure that a significantly stronger all-German identity emerges from the arduous process of national unity in the next few years." #Please replace

 nationalization.12.t: "Brigands in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_brigant_state').GetName]"
 nationalization.12.d: "The poor conditions in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_brigant_state').GetName] have led to more and more people with no prospects joining the [SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_brigant_character').GetFullName] gang. They are now wreaking havoc in the surrounding area - to such an extent that the brigands have become a real problem. There are even supporters among the common people who see them as opponents of the government and increasing Italianization, and therefore as political and regional resisters."
 nationalization.12.f: "Brigandage in Southern Italy had existed in some form since ancient times. However its origins as outlaws targeting random travellers would evolve vastly later on in the form of the political resistance movement. After the conquest of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies in 1861 by the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia (later Kingdom of Italy), the most famous and well known form of brigandage in the area emerged. Amongst the brigands were a mixture of people, with different working backgrounds and motives; the brigands included former prisoners, bandits and other people who the Italian government regarded as common criminals, but also former soldiers and loyalists of the Bourbon army. They launched attacks not only against the Italian authorities and the land owning upper-classes, but also against common people, frequently looting villages, towns and farms, and committing armed robberies against both individuals and groups, including farmers, townspeople and rival brigand bands."
 nationalization.12.g: "Another bandit masquerading as Robin Hood!"
 nationalization.13.t: "Fear for regional heritage"
 nationalization.13.d: "Ordinary people in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_regionalist_state').GetName] fear that the new national Italian institutions and the popularization of the Italian language could destroy the traditional way of life there. [SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_rural_leader_scope').GetFullName] has argued that the region's special heritage should not be ignored and that the homogenization of Italy has already progressed too far."
 nationalization.13.f: "With the failed revolution of 1848/1849, the Neo-Guelphs, as the leading arm of the Italian unity movement, became de facto powerless. They had originally spoken out in favor of a federally structured Italy under the primus inter pares presidency of the Pope. In response, centralist circles gained absolute preeminence - a phenomenon that remained prevalent well into the 20th century. Regional sensitivities were no longer taken into account but, on the contrary, regional feelings were seen as dangerous tendencies that could destroy Italian efforts at unification."
 nationalization.13.g: "[SCOPE.sState('manzoni_regionalist_state').GetName] is an Italian region like any other."
 nationalization.13.h: "We should take this special heritage into account."
 nationalization.14.t: "Dialects or languages?"
 nationalization.14.d: "The leading teachers, lecturers and professors in our country have spoken out in favor of particularly promoting the implementation of the Italian language not only in public institutions, but also in everyday life. This should significantly improve the scientific and political processes in the new Italy - but among the general population, especially the rural population, it is an extremely unpopular demand, as people there continue to speak exclusively in dialect."
 nationalization.14.f: "Even in the 18th century there was no question that the individual language varieties of the Italian peninsula were independent languages. It wasn't just Tuscan that had great prestige because of Dante Alighieri. Venetian was the official and written language of the Republic of Venice, plays such as those by Carlo Goldoni and literature were written in Venetian, which also still had a special significance as a lingua franca in the Adriatic region. Something similar can be said about Neapolitan. In the 19th century, however, the view prevailed that there was only one standard Italian variety and that all other languages in Italy were mere dialects - even though the Italian spoken in the north already had a special linguistic status. However, in the course of political movements, the reality became more and more prevalent: a language differs from a dialect in that the former has a navy and an army."

 nationalization.15.t: "The Fate of Foscolo"
 nationalization.15.d: "As national sentiment becomes more and more evident, voices are being raised calling for the body of the great Italian poet Ugo Foscolo to be transported from Great Britain to Italy."
 nationalization.15.f: "The new Italian nation was looking for landmarks: historical events but also historical personalities. The idea of creating a tomb of artists, scientists and other great personalities based on the model of the Parthenon, similar to that in France, arose early on. Santa Croce in Florence, which had previously served as the burial place of prominent citizens, seemed the right place for this. Personalities such as Machiavelli, Michelangelo and Galileo have long been more Italian than Tuscan. Ugo Foscolo, a poet of Venetian origin from the island of Zakynthos, lived in the revolutionary years and is considered a defining figure of early Italian liberalism and nationalism. He would be the perfect addition to this gallery of great Italian minds. However, Foscolo died in exile in 1827 - in Turnham Green near London."

 nationalization.17.f_foscolo: "Ugo Foscolo's return to Italy is considered one of the first key points for the young nation-state. Foscolo was celebrated like a returned hero; his burial was like a procession - with people crying and cheering. With the 'Pantheon' of great Italian personalities in Santa Croce, a fixed point of Italian nationalism was inaugurated that people could orientate themselves towards. The Italian heroes should would be the focus of this ideology, rather than the Catholic saints."
 nationalization.17.g: "A great Italian returns home!"

Musically, since the Renaissance at the latest, the peninsula has been characterized by a unique musical culture that has captivated the whole of Europe and provided new impulses. The fact that Italian was the only opera language until the 19th century is evidence of this great heritage."

The worship of Dante has become a true cult among patriots and is at the same time seen as evidence to the outside world that a pan-Italian feeling existed long before the Risorgimento - after all, it was Dante who first defined the borders of Italy as the area in which the language of the 'Sì' would be spoken. A monument is to be erected in Florence that commemorates the 'supreme poet'."
