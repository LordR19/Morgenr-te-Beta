 elgar.131.f: "Franz Liszt was an Austro-Hungarian composer, pianist, conductor, theater director, music teacher. Liszt was one of the most prominent and influential piano virtuosos and, with an oeuvre of over 1300 works and arrangements, one of the most productive composers of the 19th century. Although a large part of his oeuvre can be assigned to the piano literature, Liszt also gave a clear impetus to orchestral music with the development of the symphonic poem. His concept of program music and the use of new harmonic and formal means made him - along with Richard Wagner - the best-known protagonist of the New German School. Liszt began an extensive tour of Europe in 1839, which he continued for the next eight years. This period was Liszt's most brilliant as a concert pianist and he received many honors and much adulation during his tours. During this period, the first reports of intense responses from Liszt's fans appeared, which became referred to as Lisztomania. Lisztomania was characterized by a hysterical reaction to Liszt and his concerts. Liszt's playing was reported to raise the mood of the audience to a level of mystical ecstasy."

 elgar.133.d: "Liszt ended his stay and thanked for the hospitality. Lisztomania will continue in [SCOPE.sCountry('elgar_liszt_destination_scope').GetNameNoFlag]."
 elgar.133.f: "It is estimated that Liszt appeared in public well over one thousand times between 1839 and 1847. Moreover, his great fame as a pianist, which he would continue to enjoy long after he had officially retired from the concert stage, was based mainly on his accomplishments during this time. Adding to his reputation was that Liszt gave away much of the proceeds of his work to charity and humanitarian causes. He donated large sums to the building fund of Cologne Cathedral, and St. Stephen's Basilica in Pest, and made private donations to public services such as hospitals and schools, as well as charitable organizations such as the Leipzig Musicians Pension Fund. After the Great Fire of Hamburg in May 1842, he gave concerts in aid of those left homeless. In order to satisfy his admirers' need for a lock of his hair, Liszt acquired a dog whose fur served unnoticed as a source of curls."

An opera consists of a musical setting of a dramatic poem performed by an ensemble of singers, an accompanying orchestra, and sometimes a choir and a ballet ensemble. In addition to singing, the actors perform acting and dancing on a theater stage designed using painting, architecture, props, lighting and stage technology. The roles of the actors are visually illustrated by masks and costumes. Claudio Monteverdi, who set standards with his Orfeo, is considered the forefather of opera.

 elgar.453.d: "After a stay of several weeks and a few performances that earned him recognition from the local population, the traveling composer continued his tour."
 elgar.453.f: "A composer's destination depends on a whole range of factors. A decisive criterion are opera houses and the proximity to the last location. But factors such as cultural technologies, the presence of a Center of Art (Impressionism, Expressionism, Art Nouveau) or the existence of a conservatory also play a role.

 elgar.504.t: "Paganini's death"
 elgar.504.d: "The death of the famous violin virtuoso Niccolò Paganini sparked a controversy surrounding his funeral."
 elgar.504.f: "Niccolò Paganini was an Italian violinist and composer. He was the most celebrated violin virtuoso of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique. His 24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1 are among the best known of his compositions and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the last rites. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused. A week later, on May 27, 1840, the 57-year-old Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa. This has led to a public discussion about how to deal with Paganini. There are voices in favor of putting pressure on the church and burying Paganini in Genoa, befitting his status, and claiming his legacy. However, this would lead to an open dispute with the ecclesiastical authorities."
 elgar.504.g: "Give him a dignified burial and secure his legacy."
 elgar.504.h: "Do not intervene in this delicate matter."
 elgar.505.t: "Nabucco"
 elgar.505.d: "Giuseppe Verdi has celebrated the greatest success of his career so far with his latest opera. At the same time, it incites the national feeling of the Italian people."
 elgar.505.f: "Nabucco is an Italian-language opera in four acts composed in 1841 by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Temistocle Solera. The best-known number from the opera is the 'Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves', a chorus that is regularly given an encore in many opera houses when performed today. Nabucco is the opera that is considered to have permanently established Verdi's reputation as a composer. He commented that 'this is the opera with which my artistic career really begins. And though I had many difficulties to fight against, it is certain that Nabucco was born under a lucky star.' The story of the captivity of the Jews in Babylonia became a breakthrough throughout Italy, not least because Italians felt dominated by foreign powers in the age of nationalism. To what extent Verdi actually served Italian national feelings in Nabucco is still controversial today."
 elgar.505.g: "Va pensiero ..."
 elgar.505.h: "Those rebellious Italians again."
 elgar.507.t: "Aida"
 elgar.507.d: "On the occasion of the opening of the Suez Canal, Giuseppe Verdi premiered his Egyptian-tinged opera Aida - with a slight delay."
 elgar.507.f: "Aida is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni, based on a scenario often attributed to French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, although it has been argued that the scenario was actually written by Temistocle Solera. Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, commissioned Verdi to write the opera, paying him 150,000 francs, but the premiere was delayed. Aida met with great acclaim when it finally opened in Cairo. The costumes and accessories for the premiere were designed by Auguste Mariette, and he oversaw the design and construction of the sets, which were created in Paris and shipped to Cairo. Although Verdi did not attend the premiere in Cairo, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian (and European) premiere, held at La Scala, Milan, and in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere."

 elgar.509.t: "Franz Schubert"
 elgar.509.d: "13 years after his death, Franz Schubert's 5th symphony was presented to the general public."
 elgar.509.f: "The Fifth Symphony, in B flat major, is perhaps the most accomplished of his youthful symphonies and is widely regarded as Schubert's first 'mature' symphony. Its elaboration is of chamber music perfection, for the instrumentation is smaller than that of any other symphony, and its proportions are finely tuned to one another. It can be understood as Schubert's productive examination of Mozart's symphonic works and reveals Schubert's complete otherness and independence. According to Schubert's own entries on the score, the work was composed between September and October 3, 1816; it was written at a time when Schubert was looking for his own musical language. The first performance of Schubert's 5th symphony took place with a small amateur orchestra in Vienna in 1816; the first public performance, on the other hand, only took place on October 17, 1841, thirteen years after Schubert's death, under the baton of Michael Leitermayer."
 elgar.509.g: "Even from heaven, Schubert delights us with his music."
 elgar.510.t: "Controversy over Poliuto"
 elgar.510.d: "An irreconcilable dispute between the king and the composer Donizetti threatens to trigger his dismissal."
 elgar.510.f: "From 1829 to 1838 Gaetano Donizetti was music director of the Royal Theaters of Naples and, despite travels and commissions in other states, de facto the most important cultural figure of the kingdom and its most famous representative. A whole series of famous Donizetti operas were written in Naples, which consolidated the position of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies as a top-ranking music location. But despite the many successes, Donizetti had to fight again and again with the Neapolitan censorship, which defaced his libretti or canceled entire operas. In the most recent dispute, the king himself intervened to prevent the performance of the opera 'Poliuto'. After many years of quarrels with the censorship, Donizetti has grown weary and has made preparations to flee to Paris. The political elite has united behind the king; preventing Donizetti from his plans would not only upset the political and social landscape, but would also massively damage the king's authority and reputation."
 elgar.510.g: "The king has spoken, he may pack his things."
 elgar.510.h: "We must do everything to prevent Donizetti from leaving!"
 elgar.511.t: "Les Martyres, 1840"
 elgar.511.d: "The Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti has reached Paris and performed his opera 'Les Martyres' there, which was extremely well received by the public."
 elgar.511.f: "Poliuto is a three-act tragedia lirica (or tragic opera) by Gaetano Donizetti from the Italian libretto by Salvadore Cammarano, which was based on Pierre Corneille's play Polyeucte written in 1641/42. It reflected the life of the early Christian martyr Saint Polyeuctus. Regarded by one author as Donizetti's "most personal opera" with the music being "some of the finest Donizetti was to compose", Poliuto was written in 1838 for performances planned at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples later that year. However, close to the time for rehearsals to begin, King Ferdinand II refused to allow the martyrdom of a Christian saint to be seen on stage and forbade the production. Angry at the decision and with a commission for the Paris Opéra due from the composer, Donizetti paid the penalty to the San Carlo for not producing an original work as a substitute, and left Naples for Paris. As his first commission for Paris, he decided to revise Poliuto and between 1839-40 a French text, with the title Les Martyres."
 elgar.511.g: "Not bad for an Italian."
 elgar.512.t: "The Stabat Mater"
 elgar.512.d: "Gaetano Donizetti is visiting Bologna to conduct the premiere of Gioachino Rossini's Stabat Mater. The performance was a complete success."
 elgar.512.f: "When Donizetti went to Bologna for the Stabat Mater, Rossini attended the third performance, and the two men - each former students of the Bologna Conservatory - met for the first time, with Rossini declaring that Donizetti was 'the only maestro in Italy capable of conducting my Stabat as I would have it'. Friends including his brother-in-law, Antonio Vasselli (known as Totò) - continually attempted to persuade him to take up an academic position in Bologna rather than the Vienna court engagement, if for no other reason that it would give the composer a base from which to work and teach and not be continually exhausting himself with travel between cities. Donizetti reported the public's reaction: 'The enthusiasm is impossible to describe. Even at the final rehearsal, which Rossini attended, in the middle of the day, he was accompanied to his home to the shouting of more than 500 persons. The same thing the first night, under his window, since he did not appear in the hall.'"
 elgar.512.g: "Rossini & Donizetti - a match in heaven!"
 elgar.513.t: "Is Donizetti going insane?"
 elgar.513.d: "Donizetti's increasingly rapid mental decline led to him being committed to an insane asylum in Paris."
 elgar.513.f: "Donizetti reported in his letters over a long period of time, starting in the 1820s, about headaches, sometimes fever attacks that lasted only one day and also about occasional depressive moods. The extraordinary amount of work that he accomplished throughout his life, as well as the long journeys that were particularly strenuous at the time, especially after he moved to Paris and later to Vienna, led to increased symptoms of exhaustion from 1842 to 1843. The occasional headache and fever attacks were accompanied by dizziness and sometimes 'sensations in the head'. In 1845 Donizetti's health deteriorated rapidly and he collapsed on the street in Paris. The doctors forbade him to compose - which depressed him even more. Finally, under false pretenses, he was lured into the insane asylum at Ivry-sur-Seine without his knowledge and against his will, and was forcibly interned there. The ailing composer quickly saw through his predicament as a 'prisoner' and classification as a 'maniac' and wrote desperate and heartbreaking letters to friends and relatives asking for help."
 elgar.513.g: "Maybe it's better that way."
 elgar.513.h: "Get him out of the insane asylum and give him rest in Bergamo."
 elgar.514.f: "It took a full 17 months for Donizetti to be rescued from the mental asylum. A planned departure was prevented by doctors, but also by the police prefect of Paris for inscrutable reasons. Only with the help of diplomatic pressure could the now completely apathetic composer be brought back by his brother Francesco and his nephew Andrea. The daughter of Baroness Rosa Rota-Basoni played the piano for the composer every day and sang arias from his works, his friend Dolci spoke to him in the Bergamasque dialect and he received a visit from the tenor Rubini, but Donizetti showed no more reactions. Donizetti died a week after an apoplectic stroke with hemiplegia, high fever and subsequent infections. Autopsy results showed symptoms of 'past' meningitis and a partially damaged, inflamed spinal cord."
 elgar.514.g: "A tragic death."
 elgar.515.t: "Donizetti cured"
 elgar.515.d: "The composer has recovered after an intensive cure and wants to compose with renewed zest for life."
 elgar.515.f: "Under pressure from our government, Donizetti was quickly expelled from the insane asylum. On doctor's orders, he was to experience a several-month cure in his hometown of Bergamo under the best possible circumstances. The return to country life, freedom from stress and pressure, and returning to his roots has borne fruit after many months. Donizetti, apathetic for weeks, responded to one of his own arias, sung by Giovanna, daughter of Baroness Rosa Rota-Basoni. Talking to family members in the local dialect also showed progress day by day. After years of therapy, the once terminally ill composer seems to have been brought back to life."
 elgar.515.g: "A medical miracle."
 elgar.516.t: "Liszt versus Thalberg"
 elgar.516.d: "Two of the most famous pianists competed against each other in Paris: Franz Liszt challenged the most important living pianist, Sigismund Thalberg."
 elgar.516.f: "In the winter of 1835/36 Sigismund Thalberg made his debut in a private concert given by the secretary of the Austrian embassy in Paris. He was greeted enthusiastically by the artists present, including Rossini and Meyerbeer, and praised as the inventor of a new style of piano. While Franz Liszt's concerts in Lyon brought in around 500-600 francs, Thalberg earned 10,000 francs from a single concert at the Italian Theater. Before Thalberg appeared on his second stay in Paris, Liszt published a review riddled with insinuations and polemics. According to Liszt, Thalberg's success came about solely through propaganda. Thalberg appeared again in Paris from February 1837 and was celebrated again. On March 31, both artists performed at a charity event organized by Princess Belgiojoso."
 elgar.516.g: "Thalberg was better."
 elgar.516.h: "Liszt was better."
 elgar.517.t: "Von der Wiege zum Grabe"
 elgar.517.d: "In Rome, Franz Liszt completed his last symphonic poem. The music community doesn't know what to make of this composer's latest 'error'."
 elgar.517.f: "In the late years of his life, Liszt increasingly turned to sacred music and church music. His last tone poem, 'From the cradle to the grave' therefore differed from all his predecessors. Liszt was inspired by a drawing by the Hungarian painter Mihály Zichy. Large sections of the work do not require a powerful orchestra, especially the beginning sounds like chamber music; many islands of sound are formed in which the musical material is poor, and solo passages are not uncommon, especially at the end of the movements. The harmonics used are also a harbinger of times to come. During his lifetime, however, music critics rated the work as the 'mistake of an old man'."
 elgar.517.g: "Later generations will understand."
 elgar.518.t: "Lohengrin"
 elgar.518.d: "The premiere of Richard Wagner's 'Lohengrin' was not only a full crowd - but triggered a veritable admiration for Wagner in Germany."
 elgar.518.f: "Lohengrin is a romantic opera in three acts by the German composer Richard Wagner. With Lohengrin, Wagner created the new operatic form of through-composed musical drama. The composition is not divided into individual numbers, but is played through act by act without interruption. Wagner thus sets himself apart from the conventional structure of number operas with arias, recitatives and choral parts. In order to be able to translate the inner life of the stage characters into clearly legible musical motifs, Wagner used leitmotifs (e.g. the Grail motif and the question ban motif). The opera has inspired other works of art. King Ludwig II of Bavaria named his castle Neuschwanstein Castle after the Swan Knight."
 elgar.518.g: "Inspiring."
 elgar.519.t: "Kunstwerk der Zukunft"
 elgar.519.d: "During his stay in Switzerland, the composer Richard Wagner wrote numerous treatises on music and art that were to become groundbreaking for the German and international understanding of aesthetics."
 elgar.519.f: "The 'Artwork of the Future' is an art-theoretical writings by Richard Wagner that he wrote between 1849 and 1852 in Zurich. As in his writing 'Art and the Revolution', Wagner laments the decay of the arts and develops his model of the new unity of the arts, the 'Gesamtkunstwerk'. As in his previous writings, Wagner developed his conviction that Greek art was embedded in Greek religion and mysticism and that, through the destruction of religion, art was also loosing its cohesion and becoming 'individual arts' (drama, music and dance) had to degenerate. He complains that the art of music as a pure accompaniment to the word has withered away. In the further course of hisexplanations he goes into great detail on the development of the different arts, from the ideal state during antiquity to the decadence of his time. In his next and most important written work, Opera and Drama, Richard Wagner then explains very precisely (and very theoretically) how he imagines the optimal 'union' of music and poetry. A little later he set to work on the 'practical' execution and wrote and composed his 'Ring des Nibelungen' as the music drama par excellence after years of work."
 elgar.519.g: "Who is supposed to understand these hard-to-read boxed sentences?"
 elgar.520.t: "Tristan und Isolde"
 elgar.520.d: "Tristan und Isolde is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner to a German libretto by the composer, based largely on the 12th-century romance Tristan and Iseult by Gottfried von Strassburg. The opera was enormously influential among Western classical composers and provided direct inspiration to composers such as Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and Benjamin Britten. Other composers like Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky formulated their styles in contrast to Wagner's musical legacy. Many see Tristan as a milestone on the move away from common practice harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century."
 elgar.520.f: "'The work that has always aroused my greatest admiration is Tristan. A shuddering astonishment seizes me in front of this gigantic building, and it still seems incredible to me how a human being could conceive and realize it. I consider the second act to be one of the most sublime creations of the spirit ever created. This second act is wonderful, wonderful, unspeakably wonderful.' - Giuseppe Verdi"
 elgar.521.t: "Richard Wagner Festival"
 elgar.521.d: "The establishment of Richard Wganer's Festspielhaus is considered one of the highlights of 19th-century music culture."
 elgar.521.f: "The Bayreuth Festival is a music festival held annually, at which performances of operas by the 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner are presented. Wagner himself conceived and promoted the idea of a special festival to showcase his own works, in particular his monumental cycle 'Der Ring des Nibelungen' and 'Parsifal'. Performances take place in a specially designed theatre, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. Wagner personally supervised the design and construction of the theatre, which contained many architectural innovations to accommodate the huge orchestras for which Wagner wrote as well as the composer's particular vision about the staging of his works. The Festival has become a pilgrimage destination for Wagnerians and classical-music enthusiasts. Present at this unique musical event were Kaiser Wilhelm, Dom Pedro II of Brazil, King Ludwig, and other members of the nobility, as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and such accomplished composers as Anton Bruckner, Edvard Grieg, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Franz Liszt, and the young Arthur Foote."
 elgar.521.g: "A peak of german culture!"
 elgar.523.t: "Tannhäuser Scandal"
 elgar.523.d: "A performance of Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser caused a real scandal that outraged all of Parisian society. In addition to Wagner's breach of the good rules of French opera life, animosity between the German and French musical worlds also played a role."
 elgar.523.f: "Wagner has always had a difficult time in Paris, not only because of his competition with the popular Giacomo Meyerbeer. In order to accommodate his opera Tannhäuser at the Grand Opera, he had to bow to French customs - such as the installation of a ballet. But Wagner vehemently resisted the specifications and only included a bacchanal. At the same time, Wagner made himself unpopular with the musicians with agonizingly long rehearsals. The premiere caused a scandal: the gentlemen of the Paris 'Jockey Club' felt betrayed when the ballet didn't appear after the overture. The gentlemen didn't come because of the music, but to watch the beautiful women and to visit them later in the changing room. Since they didn't get what they wanted, they sabotaged the event with whistles and shouts. The next day was no better: the Parisian press teared the performance up in the air. Not only France, but also Wagner's friends and enemies in Germany will be watching our reaction closely."
 elgar.523.g: "He should never show up in Paris again!"
 elgar.523.h: "We have to appease Herrn Wagner."
 elgar.524.t: "Holberg Suite"
 elgar.524.d: "Edvard Grieg's Holberg Suite, which premiered in Oslo, has not only turned out to be a musical masterpiece, but has also inspired Norwegian national sentiment."
 elgar.524.f: "The Holberg Suite, subtitled 'Suite in olden style', is a suite of five movements based on eighteenth-century dance forms, written by Edvard Grieg in 1884 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Dano-Norwegian humanist playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754). It exemplifies nineteenth-century music which makes use of musical styles and forms from the preceding century. The Holberg Suite was originally composed for the piano, but a year later was adapted by Grieg himself for string orchestra. The suite consists of an introduction and a set of dances. It is an early essay in neoclassicism, an attempt to echo as much as was known in Grieg's time of the music of Holberg's era. Although not as famous as Grieg's incidental music from Peer Gynt, which is itself usually performed as arranged in a pair of suites, many critics regard the works as of equal merit."
 elgar.525.t: "New Lanes"
 elgar.525.d: "In the 'Neue Magazin für Musik', Robert Schumann mentioned a new artist who suddenly became famous overnight. His name is Johannes Brahms and he made a strong impression on both Schumann and his wife Clara."
 elgar.525.f: "'And he has come, young blood, at whose cradle graces and heroes have kept watch. His name is Johannes Brahms, he came from Hamburg, worked there in a dark silence, but was trained by an excellent and enthusiastic teacher in difficult settings of art, recommended to me shortly before by a revered, well-known master. On the outside, too, he wore all the signs that announce to us: He is a called man.' - Robert Schumann"
 elgar.525.g: "We expect great things from Mr. Brahms."

 elgar.526.d: "Johannes Brahms's 'Song of the Fates' was premiered in Basel. Along with Vienna, Switzerland was one of Brahms' most important places to stay."
 elgar.526.f: "The Gesang der Parzen (Song of the Fates) is the last composition for choir and orchestra by Johannes Brahms. More than 10 years after the cantata Rinaldo op. 50 and the Alto Rhapsody op. 53, Brahms again used a text by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. According to Max Kalbeck, Brahms was inspired to compose by the actress Charlotte Wolter, who appeared in the role of Iphigenia at the Burgtheater in Vienna. On June 13, 1896, Brahms wrote about the piece: 'I often hear philosophizing about the sixth verse of the Parzenlied. I think the heart of the unsuspecting listener should grow soft and the eye wet at the mere entrance of the major; only then does the misery of mankind seize him.'"

 elgar.527.d: "The son of the well-known wool entrepreneur Julius Delius took lessons from an organist and published some of his first compositions."
 elgar.527.f: "Frederick Delius, a born Englishman, was the son of the German wool entrepreneur Julius Delius. The father wanted his son to be the successor in the company, but the son paid little attention to business in Europe and was more interested in art and music. Therefore, Delius jr. transferred to an orange plantation in Florida to keep him away from the influences of the European metropolises. However, it was this transfer that was to be of outstanding importance for his later musical creativity. In Jacksonville, Delius met the Catholic organist Thomas Ward, who Delius says was the only one who actually taught him anything. A little later Delius was to publish his first compositions in Danville, Virginia."

 elgar.528.d: "After disputes in his Austrian homeland, Gustav Mahler found an audience in New York, with whom his works were very well received. Some of those responsible in the US music world would like to engage him on a long-term basis."
 elgar.528.f: "For some, the German doublet was too tight when they heard the name Mahler. Some out of excitement, but most out of anger. It has been like this from day one. He had an immediate effect, inciting, provocative, alarming - it doesn't matter: he belongs to the electric and electrifying natures that give off sparks or ignite at the slightest touch. In the beginning, of course, only his frenetic unpopularity made him popular. Carried by the favor of hate, carefully illuminated by envy, that eternally sleepless and powerful protector of all that is real, by ridicule, by envy and slander, proclaimed by the loudest sound carriers on every street corner, he has become famous. […] And so it was heard every day that he mistreats his musicians, whips them into inhuman work, almost incites them to death, and that if they were only able, they would all like to drown him in a spoonful of water. It was said that he shortened his singers, drilled them like recruits, played with them like the Great Turk with his slaves. […] The intensity of his being seemed to fill the whole city of New York. - Felix Salten"

 elgar.529.t: "Scythian Suite"
 elgar.529.d: "Sergei Prokofiev, one of the most promising young talents in Russian music, shocked the audience today with a scandalous performance."
 elgar.529.f: "Prokofiev originally wrote the music for the ballet Ala i Lolli, the story of which takes place among the Scythians. Commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, the ballet was written to a scenario by Russian poet Sergey Gorodetsky. But when Diaghilev rejected the score even before its completion, the composer reworked the music into a suite for concert performance. The performance became the biggest scandal in the history of Prokofiev's premieres. The director of the Conservatory at the time, Alexander Glazunov, left the hall during the concert, the majority of the audience was outraged and the reviews were devastating. However, Prokofiev was not very impressed and the next day wrote succinctly to Moscow that the performance had gone on 'with a real racket'."

 elgar.530.t: "The Rhenish Symphony"
 elgar.530.d: "Robert Schumann took a job in Düsseldorf on the Rhine and was suddenly inspired by the construction work on Cologne Cathedral to write a new work."
 elgar.530.f: "Robert Schumann is regarded as one of the most representative composers of the Romantic era. In 1850, he suceeded Ferdinand Hiller as musical director and moved to Düsseldorf. Although criticized regarding his poor conductor skills and scoffed because of his 'creative decay', Schumann composed his last symphony, the 'Rhenish'. He used Beethoven's and Mendelssohn's symphonies as a model, but was also inspired by his impressions of the Rhineland. Schumann himself stated that his journey to Cologne and the sight of the cathedral were his main inspiration for this composition, which became one of his most famous works."
 elgar.530.g: "It was a good idea to continue building the cathedral, wasn't it?"
 elgar.531.t: "Schumann's Suicide Attempt"
 elgar.531.d: "The composer Robert Schumann was rescued from the river at the last minute today - he had apparently wanted to take his own life in mental confusion. It is still completely unclear how to deal with him."
 elgar.531.f: "On February 10, 1854, Schumann's psychological suffering increased dramatically. He mainly complained about 'hearing problems'. Tones, chords, entire musical pieces raged in his head and robbed him of sleep. Meanwhile, Schumann was watched day and night by his wife and children and was already under medical supervision, but was still able to leave the apartment on February 27, 1854 at an unobserved moment. He headed for the nearby pontoon bridge, climbed over the railing and, after throwing his wedding ring into the water, threw himself into the river. He was rescued by the bridge master and other unknown men, taken home and looked after by a doctor who was summoned. After his suicide attempt, he wished to be admitted to the institution for the treatment and care of mentally ill and insane people in Endenich near Bonn, which was opened in 1844 by the psychiatrist Franz Richarz."
 elgar.531.g: "There is nothing we can do."
 elgar.531.h: "Send him to the modern mental asylum near Endenich."
 elgar.532.t: "The Death of Schumann"
 elgar.532.d: "After several years of mental derangement, Robert Schumann, once a promising musical talent, died in a mental asylum, ignored by the world."
 elgar.532.f: "Brahms saw Schumann on March 31 and August 19, 1854 without being able to speak to him. On January 11th, February 23rd and April 2nd, 1855, however, both were able to talk in detail. Schumann was doing so well that he was able to play music on the square piano with Brahms and accompany him part of the way to the Bonn train station under the supervision of a guard. On April 10, 1856, Brahms found Schumann in a precarious condition. Schumann could no longer speak intelligibly. On May 1, 1856, it was last mentioned in the medical records that Schumann played the piano. Most of the time he could hardly express himself intelligibly. Clara Schumann's plan from April 1856 to bring Schumann to Düsseldorf and look after him there herself was not realized. From mid-July 1856, Schumann ate less and less. On July 26, 1856 he had 'twitches in various muscles, the face and the limbs'. Mucous rales suggested pneumonia. Robert Schumann died on July 29th; no one was present."
 elgar.533.t: "The miraculous recovery of Robert Schumann"
 elgar.533.d: "Apparently the modern methods in the Endenich sanatorium have had an effect. Schumann is showing signs of improvement, although his return to work will still take a few months."
 elgar.533.f: "Schumann's miraculous recovery began after he told Peters in September 1854, shortly before their 14th wedding anniversary, that Düsseldorf had collapsed and Clara and the children were dead. In order to dispel this delusion, Peters asked Clara Schumann for a letter to her husband. This led to the first exchange of letters since the admission. From now on, Schumann again took an active part in life outside the institution. He also corresponded with his children, Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim and with publishers. Between September 1854 and May 1855 he wrote around 25 letters. During this time, Schumann often expressed his wish to be able to leave Endenich again. He played the piano every now and then. He studied compositions by Brahms. On January 11, 1855 he had his first visit from Johannes Brahms. From then on, Schumann's condition steadily improved until the doctors allowed Clara Schumann to visit. With her support and that of Brahms, Schumann soon began composing again - and thus initiated a self-healing process."
 elgar.533.g: "But how is that possible?"
 elgar.534.t: "Tango"
 elgar.534.d: "Tango interpreter Carlos Gardel has recorded his first record hit with Mi noche triste."
 elgar.534.f: "Carlos Gardel was the most prominent figure in the history of tango. He was one of the most influential interpreters of world popular music in the first half of the 20th century. Gardel is the most famous popular tango singer of all time and is recognized throughout the world. He created the tango-canción in 1917 with his rendition of Pascual Contursi and Samuel Castriota's Mi noche triste. With 'Mi noche triste', the birth of sentimental tango took place. Nostalgic, melodramatic, and sad, the new lyrics and the music embodied Buenos Aires and its people."

A funeral procession with several bands, hundreds of torchbearers and thousands of spectators marks the farewell for a man who is said to have lived a perfect life."
 elgar.614.f: "In 1867 Berlioz received the news that his son had died in Havana of yellow fever. Macdonald suggests that Berlioz may have sought distraction from his grief by going ahead with a planned series of concerts in St Petersburg and Moscow, but far from rejuvenating him, the trip sapped his remaining strength.  He went to Nice to recuperate in the Mediterranean climate, but fell on rocks by the shore, possibly because of a stroke, and had to return to Paris, where he convalesced for several months. In August 1868, he felt able to travel briefly to Grenoble to judge a choral festival.  After arriving back in Paris he gradually grew weaker and died at his house in the Rue de Calais on 8th March 1869, at the age of 65. He was buried in Montmartre Cemetery with his two wives, who were exhumed and re-buried next to him."
 elgar.615.f: "After the failed marriage to Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, Liszt increasingly devoted himself to compositions with religious themes. In Rome, where he mostly stayed until 1870, he led a part mundane, part monastic life and withdrew to a monastery in the summer of 1863, where Pope Pius IX also visited him. In 1865 Liszt underwent tonsure and received the four minor orders. From then on, as a cleric, he wore the Roman collar and was addressed as an abbe. In 1886 Liszt attended the Wagner Festival. At the time of the trip, Liszt was already seriously ill and died a few days after his arrival on July 31, 1886 as a result of pneumonia. Bernhard Schnappauf, doctor and friend of Richard Wagner, spent the last few days on his deathbed and reported that Liszt died quietly and with dignity. He closed his eyes and made the death mask, for which, according to the old custom, he was entitled to the shroud and pillowcase."
 elgar.616.f: "On September 16, 1882, Wagner traveled with his family to Venice, where he spent several weeks with Franz Liszt. On December 25, as a birthday present for Cosima, he gave a joint concert for the last time in the Teatro La Fenice; he conducted his youth symphony in C major. On February 13, 1883, he stayed in the side wing of the Palazzo Vendramin-Calergi that he and his family lived in. Around 3 p.m., the family waited at the table for Wagner, who, despite having a heart attack, was in his study writing an essay on the feminine in the human. The maid found him slumped at his desk over the words 'Nevertheless, the process of woman's emancipation proceeds only with ecstatic convulsions. Love - Tragedy'. He said: 'My wife and the doctor' before falling unconscious and dying in Cosima's arms around 3:30 p.m."
 elgar.617.f: "Edvard Grieg died at the Municipal Hospital in Bergen, Norway, on 4 September 1907 at age 64 from heart failure. He had suffered a long period of illness. His last words were: 'Well, if it must be so.' The funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people to the streets of his home town to honor him. Obeying his wish, his own Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak was played with orchestration by his friend Johan Halvorsen, who had married Grieg's niece. In addition, the Funeral March movement from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played. Grieg was cremated in the first Norwegian crematorium opened in Bergen just that year, and his ashes were entombed in a mountain crypt near his house, Troldhaugen. After the death of his wife, her ashes were placed alongside his."
 elgar.618.f: "Brahms died on April 3, 1897 in the early morning at the age of 63 in his apartment at Karlsgasse 4, where he had lived since 1872 - according to some biographies of liver cancer, according to more recent information of pancreatic carcinoma. His last public appearance was on March 7, 1897 when he saw Hans Richter conduct his Symphony No. 4; there was an ovation after each of the four movements. After being laid out in the mourning house, where Carl Kundmann removed his death mask and Ludwig Michalek made a last pastel picture, the consecration took place on April 6 in the Lutheran City Church."
 elgar.619.f: "'Morning and Vienna. A chaos. You cling to details that no one can yet know. He is to be buried in the small cemetery in Grinzing, next to his little daughter. The corpse is brought. The other morning. The road 'an den Langen Lüssen' leads across country to cypress trees. The chapel is a small space, just for the coffin and some wreaths. The others line the paths to the grave. A woman comes by and says to another: 'Now he's in peace inside. Everything was too small for him.' The church in Grinzing is small, the churchyard narrow. And a spectacle for the Viennese is imminent. The church and cemetery will be cordoned off. Only cards will give access. We learn that Franz Schalk, Gregor, and the board of directors have requested that the opera be closed on the day of the funeral. No word on that. The court, the municipality of Vienna, does not move. And then the celebration. We are standing in front of the church when the coffin is carried out. It's raining. We get to the grave more quickly via a vineyard path. The procession arrives. The rain stops. A nightingale sings, the clods fall. A rainbow. And the hundreds are silent.' - Paul Stefan"

 elgar.701.d: "To mark the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution, Hector Berlioz composed a piece that attracted great public admiration."
 elgar.701.f: "The French government commissioned the symphony for the celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution which had brought Louis-Philippe I to power, for which it was erecting the July Column in the Place de la Bastille. Berlioz had little sympathy for the régime, but welcomed the opportunity to write the work because the government had offered him 10,000 francs for it. The Symphonie militaire (later renamed Symphonie funèbre et triomphale), rather than following the model Berlioz had established in Romeo and Juliet, represents a reversion to an earlier pre-Beethovenian style in the tradition of monumental French public ceremonial music. Berlioz revised the score in January 1842, adding an optional part for strings and a final chorus to a text by Antony Deschamps. Richard Wagner attended a performance of this new version at the Salle Vivienne on 1 February 1842. On 5 February, he told Robert Schumann that he found passages in the last movement of Berlioz's symphony so 'magnificent and sublime that they can never be surpassed.'"
 elgar.702.t: "Liszt in Weimar"
 elgar.702.d: "After many years of concert tours, the piano virtuoso and composer Franz Liszt is considering settling in Weimar."
 elgar.702.f: "The Weimar years were Franz Liszt's most artistically productive period. He wrote many of his piano works in Weimar, such as the Piano Sonata in B minor, the Harmonies poétiques et religieuses cycle, fifteen Hungarian Rhapsodies, as well as numerous transcriptions, piano reductions and revisions of earlier piano works, such as the Paganini Etudes. Two of his previously conceived piano concertos also received their final form here. In Weimar, Liszt conducted many works by contemporary composers, some of whom were controversial at the time, and also performed their operas. He conducted works by Richard Wagner, who was particularly close to him and whom he helped to flee to Zurich in the spring of 1849 after the Dresden uprising. In the years that followed, he supported Wagner financially as well as morally and maintained a lively correspondence with him. Later, Liszt and Wagner often appeared together as conductors. From 1865, after Wagner had a relationship with Liszt's daughter Cosima, the relationship cooled off for a long time."

 elgar.703.f: "'No subsequent experience has given me feelings even remotely similar to those I had on this day of the first performance of Rienzi. The only too well-founded anxiety as to their success has so dominated my feelings at all subsequent first performances of my works that I could never really enjoy them or take much notice of the way the audience was behaving. [...] The initial success of Rienzi was no doubt assured beforehand. But the uproarious way in which the public declared its partiality for me was extraordinary ... The public had been forcibly predisposed to accept it, because everyone connected with the theatre had been spreading such favourable reports ... that the entire population was looking forward to what was heralded as a miracle ... In trying to recall my condition that evening, I can remember it only as possessing all the features of a dream.' - Richard Wagner" 
 elgar.704.t: "Piano Concerto in A minor"
 elgar.704.d: "A piano concerto by Edvard Grieg celebrated its world premiere today in Copenhagen. It is already foreseeable that this will be one of his most popular pieces."
 elgar.704.f: "The Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 16, composed by Edvard Grieg in 1868, was the only concerto Grieg completed. The work is among Grieg's earliest important works, written by the 24-year-old composer in 1868 in Søllerød, Denmark, during one of his visits there to benefit from the climate. Grieg's concerto provides evidence of his interest in Norwegian folk music; the opening flourish is based on the motif of a falling minor second followed by a falling major third, which is typical of the folk music of Grieg's native country. The work was premiered by Edmund Neupert on 3 April 1869, in Copenhagen, with Holger Simon Paulli conducting. Some sources say that Grieg himself, an excellent pianist, was the intended soloist, but he was unable to attend the premiere owing to commitments with an orchestra in Christiania (now Oslo). Among those who did attend the premiere were the Danish composer Niels Gade and the Russian pianist Anton Rubinstein, who provided his piano for the occasion. Grieg revised the work at least seven times, usually in subtle ways, but the revisions amounted to over 300 differences from the original orchestration."

The premiere took place on November 2, 1873 in Vienna under Brahms' direction. The piece falls into an epoch in which Brahms wanted to celebrate his stay in Vienna. On the one hand he left Detmold and Hamburg disappointed years ago. On the other hand, he strived to live where his great classical role models had lived and to continue the Viennese tradition."

 elgar.706.f: "'And there he was in person in the theater office when I came out from my first visit to Pollini: pale, thin, small in stature, long face, the steep forehead framed by deep black hair, important eyes behind glasses, furrows of suffering and of humor in his countenance, which, while speaking to another, showed the most amazing change of expression, just as interesting, demonic, intimidating incarnation of Kapellmeister Kreisler as the youthful reader of E.T.A. Hoffmann's fantasies could imagine; he kindly asked me about my musical ability and knowledge - to which I replied, to his evident satisfaction with a mixture of shyness and self-confidence - and left me in a sort of dazed and shaken state. [...] Mahler appeared to me in face and demeanor as genius and demon [...]' - Bruno Walter"
 elgar.707.t: "Piano Concerto No. 2"
 elgar.707.d: "After many setbacks, the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff has made an impressive return: his Second Piano Concerto caused frenetic applause."
 elgar.707.f: "After the disastrous 1897 premiere of his First Symphony, Rachmaninoff suffered a psychological breakdown that prevented composition for three years. Although depression sapped his energy, he still engaged in performance. Conducting and piano lessons became necessary to ease his financial position. In 1899, he was supposed to perform the Second Piano Concerto in London, which he had not composed yet due to illness, and instead made a successful conducting debut. Relatives decided to introduce him to the neurologist Nikolai Dahl, whom he visited daily from January to April 1900, which helped restore his health and confidence in composition. Rachmaninoff dedicated the concerto to Dahl for successfully treating him. After he fulfilled his 1908 London concert engagement at the Queen's Hall under Serge Koussevitzky  a flattering review by The Times emerged: 'The direct expression of the work, the extraordinary precision and exactitude of Rachmaninoff's playing, and even the strict economy of movement of arms and hands which he exercises, all contributed to the impression of completeness of performance.'"

 elgar.708.f: "'Rehearsal of the Classical Symphony with the State Orchestra, I conducted it myself, completely improvising, having forgotten the score and never indeed having studied it from a conducting perspective. I thought it might be a complete debacle, but nothing happened and in any case the parts has so many mistakes in them that the session turned mainly into one for making corrections. In Kislovodsk, I had worried that there would be some antagonism from a 'Revolutionary Orchestra' playing my new works, but the opposite was the case: the State Orchestra, infused with much new young blood, was flexible and attentive, and played the Symphony with evident enjoyment.' - Sergei Prokofiev"
 elgar.709.t: "Romeo and Juliet"
 elgar.709.d: "Pyotr Tchaikovsky, an aspiring young composer, has presented his overture Romeo and Juliet. The audience received the work with mixed feelings."
 elgar.709.f: "Not only at the beginning, but throughout his entire career, Tchaikovsky had to assert himself against critics and competitors. The overture Romeo and Juliet, for example, was intended to be a failure when it was published. On the other hand, this criticism, which Tchaikovsky repeatedly received throughout his life, led the composer to overcritically edit this and other works; Tchaikovsky remained one of the greatest critics of his own work throughout his career. It was also not without irony that the national Russian-minded composers praised precisely this work, even though they would later be among Tchaikovsky's harshest critics. Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky was to become one of the most important Russian composers from this period at the latest and, in just a few years, to achieve international fame that hardly any other musician of the century achieved."
 elgar.710.t: "Viva Verdi"
 elgar.710.d: "With the creation of the Italian National State and the addition of the opera city of Milan to our territory, we have the unique opportunity to engage one of the most important figures in Italian musical history: Giuseppe Verdi."
 elgar.710.f: "Giuseppe Verdi was an Italian composer and politician, universally recognized as one of the greatest opera artists and composers of all time, together with other protagonists of nineteenth-century Italian musical theater: Gioachino Rossini, Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti. He sympathized with the Risorgimento movement which pursued the unification of Italy and actively participated for a short time in political life; over the course of his long existence he established a unique position among his compatriots, becoming a profound artistic symbol of the country's unity. It was for this reason that a month after his death, a solemn and endless procession crossed Milan, accompanying his remains with the notes of 'Va, pensiero' from Nabucco, written by him 60 years earlier, effectively expressing the feelings of Italians towards their missing hero. This demonstrated the extent to which Verdi's music had been assimilated into the national consciousness. His works still remain among the best known and performed in theaters around the world, in particular Aida (1871), the aforementioned Nabucco (1842) and the so-called 'Verdi triad': Rigoletto (1851), Il Trovatore (1853) and La traviata (1853)."
 elgar.711.t: "Spring Symphony"
 elgar.711.d: "Robert Schumann's First Symphony was performed today under the direction of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. Schumann is married to the important pianist Clara (née Wieck) and has so far attracted attention more as a music critic than as a composer. Opinions differ about his pieces for piano."
 elgar.711.f: "With the exception of Franz Schubert, no German-speaking composer was as misjudged during his lifetime as Robert Schumann. While Schubert's importance was only recognized after his early death, Schumann was accused of starting as a genius and ending as a talent. Contemporaries often had no access to his work or simply did not understand his works. His piano pieces, which make up part of his fame today, were mostly unknown at the time. Mockers only saw him as the man at the side of the pianist Clara Schumann. In his native Saxony he stood in the shadow of Mendelssohn. Wagner later opposed him, while Brahms became a close confidant of Clara and Robert. Liszt saw Schumann as a pioneer of musical progress in Germany, but had no success with audiences when he included Schumann's works in his repertoire. Hopes of a permanent position at an important musical institution were repeatedly dashed. Similar to Schubert, Schumann also met a premature, tragic end."
 elgar.712.t: "King Olaf"
 elgar.712.d: "Edward Elgar has distinguished himself in recent years with his cantatas and choral works. 'Scenes from the Saga of King Olaf', his most recent work, was well received by audiences."
 elgar.712.f: "In the 1890s, Edward Elgar built up a growing reputation as a major British composer. Initially strongly influenced by continental influence - 'King Olaf' also shows echoes of the Wganer style - he gradually found his own sound language, which would encourage later British composers to take completely new paths. Elgar felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. Nevertheless, Elgar can be considered the most important British composer since Henry Purcell."
 elgar.713.t: "Hofball Music Director"
 elgar.713.d: "The position of Hofball music director has been open for years. A prestigious position that was actually supposed to go to the composer Johann Strauss. He had previously been denied this honor for political reasons. There are now increasing voices to offer the position to the son of the composer who died early."
 elgar.713.f: "Johann Strauss was an Austrian-German bandmaster and composer and was internationally recognized as the 'Waltz King'. He had already composed his first waltz at the age of six and had secretly taken violin lessons because his father had planned a career as a civil servant. Because the latter had broken with the family, his mother supported his musical training against his will. His first appearance at the Casino Dommayer, an entertainment venue known throughout the region, was a huge success. Tours initially took him through the Danube Monarchy with his own orchestra (which increased his rivalry with his father). After his father's death, he took over his orchestra and merged it with his. Because he had composed some works for the revolutionaries of 1848 and thus showed sympathy for the insurrectionary movement, he attracted the attention of the censorship authorities and fell out of favor at court despite his popularity. As a result, he was denied the position of court ball music director until 1863."
 elgar.713.g: "He missed his chance, but he is welcome to compose."
 elgar.713.h: "Give the Waltz King the place he deserves!"
 elgar.714.t: "Winner of the State Prize for Composition"
 elgar.714.d: "The winner of this year's State Prize for Composition is an exceptional Czech talent. His name is Antonín Dvořák."
 elgar.714.f: "Antonín Dvořák was a Czech composer, who frequently employed rhythms and other aspects of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia. Dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt violin student from age six. In 1874, he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two symphonies and other works. Although Dvořák was not aware of it, Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed. The prize was awarded to Dvořák in 1874 and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to him. Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock."

 elgar.715.t: "The Bohemian Composer"
 elgar.715.d: "Claude Debussy started out as the winner of the Prix de Rome, but has so far done little with his certified talent other than writing small, provocative piano pieces. What will become of this bohemian?"
 elgar.715.f: "Even at the conservatory, assessments of Claude Debussy's talent varied widely. Some praised him as a pianist and had great hopes for him. Others described him as careless. During this time he was already a pianist in the household of Nadezhda von Meck, Tchaikovsky's patron. In 1884 Debussy won the Prix de Rome, but was unambitious during his stay in Rome. He found Italian opera boring and had little use for the prevailing style of Giuseppe Verdi. He traveled back to Paris early and lived an unstable life there: 'I am sure the Institute would not approve, for, naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one. But there is no help for it! I am too enamoured of my freedom, too fond of my own ideas!'"
 elgar.715.g: "Nice piano music, but we have enough musical vagabonds."

 elgar.1011.t: "Don Pasquale"
 elgar.1011.d: "A great composer has just completed a musical masterpiece!"
 elgar.1011.f: "Don Pasquale is an opera buffa in three acts. The opera is one of the most famous of its genre and, along with L'elisir d'amore and Lucia di Lammermoor, is one of the few works by Donizetti that has had an almost continuous performance tradition since the 19th century. Based on the comedies of Carlo Goldoni, the characters are more or less closely based on types of the commedia dell'arte, but are given sentimental traits, i. H. through the ability to feel and express sadness, pain or remorse, a differentiation that goes beyond their type. Don Pasquale was an instant hit, such as only Bellini's I puritani (1835) had previously had in Paris."
 elgar.1011.g: "Bravissimo!"
 elgar.1012.t: "Dom Sébastien"
 elgar.1012.f: "Dom Sébastien is a French grand opera in five acts by Gaetano Donizetti.  It is a historic-fiction about King Sebastian of Portugal (1554-1578) and his ill-fated 1578 expedition to Morocco. At the time, Donizetti was attempting to compose an opera competitive with similar historical operas by Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy and Giacomo Meyerbeer. One critical description of the nature of Dom Sébastien is 'a funeral in five acts'. The work was received with reluctance, which Donizetti himself felt was a fiasco. Although Donizetti considered his last opera to be one of his most important works, Dom Sébastien is largely forgotten today. It was written at a time when Donizetti 'no longer had unrestricted control over his imagination', so the opera was already marked by Donizetti's incipient illness."
 elgar.1021.t: "Les Troyens"
 elgar.1021.f: "Les Troyens is a French grand opera in five acts by Hector Berlioz. The libretto was written by Berlioz himself from Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid; the score was composed between 1856 and 1858. Les Troyens is Berlioz's most ambitious work, the summation of his entire artistic career, but he did not live to see it performed in its entirety. Under the title Les Troyens à Carthage, the last three acts were premièred with many cuts by Léon Carvalho's company, the Théâtre Lyrique, at their theatre (now the Théâtre de la Ville) on the Place du Châtelet in Paris on 4 November 1863, with 21 repeat performances. After decades of neglect, today the opera is considered by some music critics as one of the finest ever written."
 elgar.1022.t: "La damnation de Faust"
 elgar.1022.f: "La damnation de Faust is a work for four solo voices, full seven-part chorus, large children's chorus and orchestra by the French composer Hector Berlioz. He called it a "légende dramatique" (dramatic legend). The French composer was inspired by a translation of Goethe's dramatic poem Faust and produced a musical work that, like the masterpiece on which it is based, defies easy categorisation. Conceived at various times as a free-form oratorio and as an opera its travelogue form and cosmic perspective have made it an extreme challenge to stage as an opera. Berlioz himself was eager to see the work staged, but once he did, he conceded that the production techniques of his time were not up to the task of bringing the work to dramatic life. Most of the work's fame has come through concert performances."
 elgar.1023.t: "Treatise on Instrumentation"
 elgar.1023.f: "'This Traité d'Instrumentation is a highly paradoxical work. It begins with a preface of several lines unrelated to the subject, in which the author takes a stand against musicians who abuse modulations and whose penchant for dissonance matches the taste that certain animals have for salty plants and thorny bushes. Then he turns to the orchestral instruments and mixes strange assertions with the most solid truths and valuable advice.[...] In his treatise, as in his orchestration, Berlioz, for all its oddities, is simply fabulous. To him my generation owes its education, and I dare say a good one. Berlioz possessed the invaluable gift of igniting the imagination and arousing love for the art he taught.[...] These seemingly superfluous musical examples made one dream, they opened the door to a new world, to a vast one and fascinating glimpse of the future, of the Promised Land.' - Camille Saint-Saëns"
 elgar.1031.t: "Les Préludes"
 elgar.1031.f: "Les Préludes is the third of Franz Liszt's thirteen symphonic poems. The music was composed between 1845-54, and began as an overture to Liszt's choral cycle Les quatre élémens (The Four Elements), then revised as a stand-alone concert overture, with a new title referring to a poem by Alphonse de Lamartine. Les préludes is the earliest example of an orchestral work entitled 'Symphonic Poem'. Liszt sees the phases of life as preludes to the melody of death. These phases of life are struggles and storms, love happiness and pain, consolation, experiencing nature. Despite the contrasts in these moods reflected in Les Préludes, the work is of great coherence. It begins with a melancholy melody, from which the first stormy main theme develops, which leads to the second theme via a pastoral part. These two themes are developed in glidingly changing moods. In a climax, the original theme flows into the first main theme as a majestic, glamorous fanfare."
 elgar.1032.t: "Hungarian Rhapsodies"
 elgar.1032.f: "The Hungarian Rhapsodies is a set of 19 piano pieces based on Hungarian folk themes, composed by Franz Liszt during 1846-1853, and later in 1882 and 1885. Liszt also arranged versions for orchestra, piano duet and piano trio. Some are better known than others, with Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 being particularly famous and No. 6, No. 10, No. 12 and No. 14 (especially as arranged for piano and orchestra as the Hungarian Fantasy) also being well known. Liszt incorporated many themes he had heard in his native western Hungary and which he believed to be folk music, though many were in fact tunes written by members of the Hungarian upper middle class, or by composers such as József Kossovits. In their original piano form, the Hungarian Rhapsodies are noted for their difficulty."
 elgar.1033.t: "Dante Symphony"
 elgar.1033.f: "The 'Dante Symphony' is a choral symphony composed by Franz Liszt. Written in the high romantic style, it is based on Dante Alighieri's journey through Hell and Purgatory, as depicted in The Divine Comedy. Some critics have argued that the Dante Symphony is not so much a symphony in the classical sense as it is two descriptive symphonic poems. Liszt's original intention was to compose the work in three movements: an Inferno, a Purgatorio and a Paradiso. The first two were to be purely instrumental, and the finale choral. Wagner, however, persuaded Liszt that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral Magnificat at the end of the second movement. Liszt scholar Humphrey Searle argues that while Liszt may have felt more at home portraying the infernal regions than the celestial ones, the task of portraying Paradise in music would not have been beyond his powers."
 elgar.1041.t: "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg"
 elgar.1041.f: "'Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg' is a music drama, or opera, in three acts, by Richard Wagner. It is the longest opera commonly performed, taking nearly four and a half hours, not counting two breaks between acts, and is traditionally not cut. The Meistersinger of Nuremberg occupies a unique place in Wagner's oeuvre. It is the only comedy among his mature operas and is also unusual among his works in being set in a historically well-defined time and place rather than in a mythical or legendary setting. It is the only mature Wagner opera based on an entirely original story. It incorporates many of the operatic conventions that Wagner had railed against in his essays on the theory of opera: rhymed verse, arias, choruses, a quintet, and even a ballet."
 elgar.1042.t: "Die Walküre"
 elgar.1042.f: "'Die Walküre' forms together with the operas 'Das Rheingold', 'Siegfried' and 'Götterdämmerung' the complete work 'Der Ring des Nibelungen'. Wagner largely followed the principles related to the form of musical drama, reflecting the feelings and moods behind the work, using a system of recurring leitmotifs to represent people, ideas, and situations rather than the conventional operatic units of arias, ensembles, and choruses. The story of Die Walküre is based on the Norse mythology told in the Völsunga saga and the Poetic Edda."
 elgar.1043.t: "Parsifal"
 elgar.1043.f: "Richard Wagner's Parsifal contains religious elements such as sacred music, the unveiling of the monstrance (Grail), baptism and the Christian communion ritual. Already in his Zurich art writings, he developed the idea of using art to clarify the core of religion. Wagner explained that in order to transform his parable-like message of salvation and regeneration of mankind through compassion - represented by the searching Parsifal and the suffering Amfortas - he chose an art form which, with religious symbolism, was intended to have a 'rapturing effect on the mind'. Wagner himself described the three-act play as a stage consecration festival play and decreed that it should only be performed in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus."
 elgar.1051.t: "Peer Gynt"
 elgar.1051.f: "Peer Gynt, Op. 23, is the incidental music to Henrik Ibsen's 1867 play of the same name, written by the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. Although composing many short piano pieces and chamber works, the work Grieg did for Henrik Ibsen stood out. Originally composing 90 minutes of orchestral music for the play, he later went back and extracted certain sections for the suites. Peer Gynt's travels around the world and distant lands are represented by the instruments Grieg chooses to use. Grieg later created two suites from his Peer Gynt music. Some of the music from these suites has received coverage in popular culture, especially the pieces 'Morning Mood', 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' and 'Solveig's Song'."
 elgar.1052.t: "Lyric Pieces"
 elgar.1052.f: "Lyric Pieces is a collection of 66 short pieces for solo piano written by Edvard Grieg. They were published in 10 volumes, from 1867 to 1901. The collection includes several of his best known pieces, such as Wedding Day at Troldhaugen, To Spring, March of the Trolls, and Butterfly. The theme of the first piece in the set, Arietta, was one of the composer's favorite melodies. In the words of pianist Andrei Gavrilow, the Lyric Pieces are 'a very special kind of diary that Grieg kept throughout his life, or a confession, because they reflect the most intimate moments in the composer's life'."
 elgar.1053.t: "Norwegian Dances"
 elgar.1053.f: "The Norwegian Dances were the Norwegian's answer to the hugely successful Slavonic Dances of Antonín Dvořák and the Hungarian Dances of Johannes Brahms. The two colleagues had published their dance series for piano four hands in 1878 and 1881 by the Simrock publishing house. At that time Grieg did not dare to orchestrate his dances, since the terrain was occupied by his friend Johan Svendsen's 'Norwegian Rhapsodies'. The orchestral version of his Norwegian Dances was therefore arranged by Robert Henriques - much to Grieg's satisfaction. For the first dance, Grieg used the popular Sinklar march, for the last three so-called "Hallings", traditional Norwegian bridal dances for young men, which are fast and very acrobatic to perform."
 elgar.1061.t: "Deutsches Requiem"
 elgar.1061.f: "'There is little to tell here, but I still have to tell you that I am completely filled with your Requiem, it is a very powerful piece, it grips the whole person in a way like few other things. The deep seriousness, combined with all the magic of poetry, has a wonderful, shocking and soothing effect. As you know, I can never really put it into words, but I feel the whole rich treasure of this work to the core, and the enthusiasm that speaks from every piece moves me deeply, which is why I can't help myself pronounce … Oh, if I could hear it, what would I give for it.' - Clara Schuman"
 elgar.1062.t: "Hungarian Dances"
 elgar.1062.f: "The Hungarian Dances by Johannes Brahms are a set of 21 lively dance tunes based mostly on Hungarian themes, completed in 1879. They vary from about a minute to five minutes in length. They are among Brahms's most popular works and were the most profitable for him. Each dance has been arranged for a wide variety of instruments and ensembles. Brahms originally wrote the version for piano four hands and later arranged the first ten dances for solo piano. The violinist Joseph Joachim, who was a friend of Brahms, created a virtuoso arrangement of all Hungarian Dances for violin and piano."
 elgar.1063.t: "Symphony No. 4"
 elgar.1063.f: "Symphony No. 4 is the last symphony written by Johannes Brahms. Today it is one of the composer's most popular and most frequently performed orchestral works. At first glance, the uncompromising way in which the work is designed was disconcerting. When Brahms and Ignaz Brüll played the symphony to friends on two pianos, Clara Schumann and Brahms' later biographer Max Kalbeck, among others, reacted with rejection. Eduard Hanslick is said to have exclaimed: 'Throughout the movement I felt as if I were being beaten through by two terribly clever people.' Elisabeth von Herzogenberg described the work as 'a small world for the clever and knowledgeable, in which the people who walk in the dark could only have a small part'. When Brahms attended a performance of the symphony in 1897, shortly before his death, he received thunderous applause from the Viennese audience, which the work has received to this day."
 elgar.1071.t: "Symphony No. 5"
 elgar.1071.f: "Like some of Mahler's other symphonies, the 5th symphony was not understood after its premiere. In 1905, after an unsuccessful performance in Hamburg, Mahler complained: 'The Fifth is a cursed work. Nobody gets it.' Music reviews in the years following the premiere were mostly negative. The music critic Ferdinand Pfohl, for example, judged that the 5th symphony was one of Mahler's weaker works. Only the Neue Zeitung für Musik gave the symphony a benevolent testimony and spoke of an 'overwhelming wealth of beauty'. Especially in comparison to the 4th symphony written two years earlier, it represents a major difference in content and form. With the rougher sound world of the 5th symphony, Mahler begins a new creative phase, which is further developed in the following 6th symphony. Only after Mahler's death did the work become more and more appreciated."
 elgar.1072.t: "Lied von der Erde"
 elgar.1072.f: "'Is it really the same man who, 'in harmony with the infinite', erected the edifice of the Eighth that we now find in the drinking song of Earth's woes? Who creeps lonely in the autumn to his beloved resting place, longing for refreshment? Who looks at youth with a friendly look of old age, with gentle emotion at beauty? Who seeks to forget the meaningless earthly existence in drunkenness and finally says goodbye in melancholy? […] It is hardly the same person and composer. All works up to that point had arisen from the feeling of life [...] The earth is disappearing, a different air is blowing in, a different light shines over it. [...] When I brought the autograph back to him, almost unable to say a word about it, he opened the 'Abschied' and said, 'What do you think? Is that bearable at all? Won't people kill themselves afterwards?' He then pointed to the rhythmic difficulties and asked jokingly, 'Any idea how to conduct that? Not me!' - Bruno Walter"
 elgar.1073.t: "Kindertotenlieder"
 elgar.1073.f: "'I can well understand that one composes such terrible lyrics when one has no children or when one has lost children. But I can't understand how you can sing about the death of children if you hugged and kissed them half an hour before, happy and healthy!' - Alma Mahler-Werfel, wife of Gustav Mahler"
 elgar.1081.t: "Piano Concerto No. 3"
 elgar.1081.f: "At that time Mahler was the only conductor whom I considered worthy to be classed with Nikisch. He devoted himself to the concerto until the accompaniment, which is rather complicated, had been practiced to perfection, although he had already gone through another long rehearsal. According to Mahler, every detail of the score was important - an attitude too rare amongst conductors. ... Though the rehearsal was scheduled to end at 12:30, we played and played, far beyond this hour, and when Mahler announced that the first movement would be rehearsed again, I expected some protest or scene from the musicians, but I did not notice a single sign of annoyance. The orchestra played the first movement with a keen or perhaps even closer appreciation than the previous time. - Sergei Rachmaninoff"
 elgar.1082.t: "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini"
 elgar.1082.f: "The piece consists of 24 variations on a theme that Niccolò Paganini himself used as the starting point for a series of variations. This melody has repeatedly served as a template for various composers, including Johannes Brahms and Franz Liszt. In some variations, Rachmaninoff uses another, much older melody: the sequence 'Dies irae', once an integral part of the Latin mass for the dead. Rachmaninoff used this theme again and again in his works. It appears in all the symphonies, the Symphonic Dances, the symphonic poem Die Toteninsel and the first piano sonata. The combination of a Paganini theme with the 'Dies irae' prompts the search for a programmatic background to the work. According to legend, the great violinist sold his soul to the devil in order to achieve perfection on his instrument and the love of a woman. The 'Dies irae' motif stands for the devil, the Paganini theme for the composing violinist himself."
 elgar.1083.t: "Symphony No. 3"
 elgar.1083.f: "'It was played in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, etc. At the first two performances I was present. It was played wonderfully. Its reception by both the public and critics was sour. One review sticks painfully in my mind: that I didn't have a Third Symphony in me any more. Personally, I am firmly convinced that this is a good work. But—sometimes composers are mistaken too! Be that as it may, I am holding to my opinion so far.' - Sergei Rachmaninoff"
 elgar.1091.t: "Romeo and Juliet"
 elgar.1091.f: "Romeo and Juliet is Sergei Prokofiev's longest and best-known ballet and is widely regarded as his most important contribution to the genre. It is considered a highlight of his musical work. The rich and varied instrumentation as well as the rhythmic complexity of the score still pose challenges for orchestra and dancers. In some places, dissonances border on atonality. The famous 'Dance of the Knights', with its dotted rhythms, is now better known as a quasi-symphonic theme. In contrast, the themes associated with Juliet's awakening to love are at once tender and youthfully lively. Prokofiev reused music from the ballet in three suites for orchestra and a solo piano work."
 elgar.1092.t: "Lieutenant Kijé"
 elgar.1092.f: "Lieutenant Kijé music was originally written to accompany the film of the same name. It was Prokofiev's first attempt at film music, and his first commission. In the early days of sound cinema, among the various distinguished composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance. Soon after the film's release, Prokofiev received an invitation from the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra to create an orchestral suite from his Kijé film music - probably the first instance of a film score being adapted into a significant musical work. While Prokofiev was in the United States for the Boston premiere he was greatly sought after by film producers, but although he was flattered and attracted by their offers he never composed a Hollywood film score."
 elgar.1093.t: "Peter and the Wolf"
 elgar.1093.f: "Peter and the Wolf is a 'symphonic fairy tale for children'. It is Prokofiev's most frequently performed work and one of the most frequently performed works in the entire classical repertoire. The narrator tells a children's story, while the orchestra illustrates it by using different instruments to play a 'theme' that represents each character in the story: 'Each character of this tale is represented by a corresponding instrument in the orchestra: the bird by a flute, the duck by an oboe, the cat by a clarinet playing staccato in a low register, the grandfather by a bassoon, the wolf by three horns, Peter by the string quartet, the shooting of the hunters by the kettle drums and bass drum. Before an orchestral performance it is desirable to show these instruments to the children and to play on them the corresponding leitmotifs. Thereby, the children learn to distinguish the sounds of the instruments during the performance of this tale.'"

 vikelas.511.f: "The first car races at the beginning of the 20th century were distance races with the greatest possible range. They should test the speed and reliability of the racing cars. While France dominated racing in the early stages, like in Great Britain they soon moved on to Grand Prix racing. That didn't change the fact that there were still important international long-distance races. The most traditional race was the Targa Florio in Sicily. From 1906 to 1977 it was held mostly in May as an important international event, some with World Cup status. After the Targa Florio, the Thousand Miles (Mille Miglia) was considered a classic among long-distance road races (the Carrera Panamericana was added in the 1950s) and the basis for the term 'Gran Turismo' (GT), which describes fast touring sports cars for long-distance racing, such as those developed by Ferrari specifically for the MM."
