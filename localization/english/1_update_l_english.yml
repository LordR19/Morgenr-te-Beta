 je_artists_realism_reason: "Realism as an art form is gaining increasing popularity. Painters in various places are already committed to this new school. However, realism still lacks its own, real center. The aversion of the traditional artistic elite to the new style has meant that it has so far only remained a phenomenon outside the academy. We need our own art academy that teaches this style, with a gallery where realistic painting finds its place - and of course a [concept_klimt_painter] who is the model figure of realism in our country."

[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] played a significant role in this and is now considered a leading figure of the realistic school of painting."
 artists.2007.f: "In art history, realism refers to a new conception of art that began in Europe in the middle of the 19th century, which turned against representations of classicism and romanticism. In art, realism attempts to recreate reality as closely as possible. The artist's appropriation of reality and its subsequent transformation into a work of art as well as its political connotations are characteristic of realism. It promotes everydayness and objectivity. Its best-known representative was the French painter Gustave Courbet, who appropriated the term realistic art and used it for his art because of its provocative effect."
 artists.2007.g: "But can you find true beauty in reality?"

 klimt.421.f: "In Rome, [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] is confronted with some of the most important painters in art history as well as with the remains of Roman architecture.

 klimt.422.f: "Bamberg is not just a picturesque place with numerous half-timbered houses and a rich baroque heritage that invite you to linger romantically. There is something about this city that made it incredibly attractive to the romantics. Ludwig Tieck and Heinrich Wackenroder were important romantics who actually came from Berlin, but on whom Franconian left their mark. They too were less interested in their studies and more interested in the country, its people and the rich heritage of the cities in the area. E. T. A. Hoffmann, another romantic from Prussia, experienced his literary breakthrough during his five-year stay in Bamberg. What his trip to Italy was for Goethe, this part of Germany was for young romantics. In the cultural landscape they not only found a connection to the idealized German Middle Ages, but also to the paintings of Albrecht Dürer in Nuremberg and to Catholicism, whose spirituality appealed more to the Romantics than secularized Protestantism."
 klimt.422.g: "The life of a good-for-nothing..."
 klimt.423.t: "Conversion"
 klimt.423.d: "Actually, [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] hasn't had much of a relationship with faith so far. However, the strong Catholicism he was confronted with, both in art and in everyday life, triggered something in [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]. More and more [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] feels a connection that [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] would never have thought possible until then. Inspired by this, [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] painted [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] first religious picture."
 klimt.423.f: "'See Bamberg and become Catholic' was a motto among German Romantics. In fact, German Romanticism was one of the few eras influenced more by Catholic than Protestant thinkers, including many converts. In a similar way, Rome also brought doubters into the fold of the Church. This may be surprising in a materialistic age in which progress and science played a leading role in society, but it was precisely the need for a counter-response that ultimately led a hedonist to the monastery."
 klimt.423.g: "I hope this isn't a cheesy picture of the Madonna."
