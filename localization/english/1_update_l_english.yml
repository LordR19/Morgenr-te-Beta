 lepsius_anthropology_tech_desc: "Paleoanthropology or simply anthropology is a branch of paleontology and anthropology which seeks to understand the early development of anatomically modern humans, a process known as hominization, through the reconstruction of evolutionary kinship lines within the family Hominidae, working from biological evidence (such as petrified skeletal remains, bone fragments, footprints) and cultural evidence (such as stone tools, artifacts, and settlement localities)."
 lepsius_invented_anthropology_loc: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_anthropologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastNameNoFormatting] is the first scientist to record human bones and skeletons meticulously and very precisely. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_anthropologist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] is seen as the #o pioneer of Anthropology#!."

 verrier_astro_physics_tech_desc: "Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. As one of the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, Astrophysics 'seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space - what they are, rather than where they are'." #Please replace

 verrier_modern_physics_tech_desc: "Modern physics is a branch of physics that developed in the early 20th century. Notable branches of modern physics include quantum mechanics, special relativity and general relativity. It is concerned with extreme conditions, such as high velocities that are comparable to the speed of light, small distances comparable to the atomic radius, and very high energies."
