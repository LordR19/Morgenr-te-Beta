 curtiss.322.f: "Although the Zeppelin attacks only caused comparatively little damage, they spread disproportionate fear and terror among the enemy in the military and civilian population and tied up large amounts of resources that were important for the war effort. To combat German military airships, the Entente Cordiale, with its approximately 15,000 men and an average of around 25 airships, had to provide weapons, material and people at a ratio of almost 1:33. Although other branches of the armed forces, such as the naval forces, also adopted such retention strategies, the efficiency of the airships remained unmatched, even by the German submarines.

Unique monuments, museums and art galleries, archaeological sites, centers of art as well as high values in the various cultural traditions are factors that make a nation an attractive tourist destination.
