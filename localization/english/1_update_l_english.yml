 concept_manzoni_literature_desc: "#b Literary Culture#!is one of the main features of [concept_morgenroete]. Print culture and newspaper culture in particular experienced significant upheavals in the 19th and 20th centuries. The mass of printed products and everyday use is represented by the printing industry. The cultural value of the literature produced is reflected in the [concept_manzoni_literary_tradition]. The latter depends largely on the [Concept('concept_manzoni_writer','$concept_manzoni_writers$')] of a country, and there are [Concept('concept_manzoni_local_writer','$concept_manzoni_national_writers$')] and [Concept('concept_manzoni_national_writer','$concept_manzoni_local_writers$')].

 mendelejew_synthetic_fuel_tech: "Synthetic Fuel"
 mendelejew_synthetic_fuel_tech_desc: "The Bergius-Pier process is a large-scale process for coal liquefaction by direct hydrogenation of coal. The macromolecules of the coal are broken down into smaller molecules by hydrogen at high pressures and temperatures. Gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons are created as products and are used as fuels and lubricants. Between 1910 and 1925, the German chemist Friedrich Bergius developed the basics of the process. Commercial process and catalyst development was carried out by BASF from 1925 under the project management of Matthias Pier."

 verrier.9020.t: "The Pułtusk meteor shower"
 verrier.9020.d: "People in Mazowia witnessed something in the sky"
 verrier.9020.f: "Nestled in the heart of Mazowia, the quaint town of Pułtusk holds a secret from the cosmos. It was here, on a cold winter's day, that a celestial event of unprecedented magnitude unfolded, forever linking this peaceful settlement with the vast, mysterious universe beyond. The year was 1868. On January 30th, the residents of Pułtusk went about their daily routines, unaware that their lives were about to intersect with an extraordinary phenomenon. As the afternoon gave way to the evening, an unusual silence fell over the town. Without warning, a brilliant light pierced the sky. A fireball, more radiant than the sun, blazed across the heavens. Witnesses described it as a blazing orb, trailing a luminous tail, splitting the sky with a thunderous roar. The fireball, later identified as a meteorite, fragmented explosively as it entered Earth's atmosphere. Thousands of pieces rained down over Pułtusk and its surrounding areas, creating a shower of meteoritic stones. This event became known as the Pułtusk meteorite shower."

 verrier.9021.f: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], an esteemed astronomer, stood at the edge of the field where the Pultusk meteor fragments had fallen. Their eyes shone with excitement as they surveyed the debris scattered across the frozen ground. Clad in a heavy coat against the January cold, they carefully picked up a fragment, their heart racing. This celestial event was a rare opportunity, and they were eager to unlock the secrets of the universe hidden within these ancient stones. Their portable lab buzzed with activity, each new discovery deepening their passion for the mysteries of the heavens."
 verrier.9021.g: "Our astronomer must give all the meteoroids to our Academy of science!"
 verrier.9021.h: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] can study one of the meteorites"

After several years of preparatory work, the company succeeded in 1931 in using an airship for a purely scientific polar expedition for the first time. Through the Arctic flight of the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, knowledge of the geography of the polar regions flown over was significantly expanded. As early as 1926 Umberto Nobile flew over the North Pole with his airship 'Norge' and later undertook an expedition with the 'Italia'."
