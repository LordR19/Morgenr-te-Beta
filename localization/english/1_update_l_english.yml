 rapanui.405.f: "In advance of the infamous Franklin expedition to cross the Northwest Passage, the ships Erebus and Terror were modernized, including additional steel reinforcement on the bow and hull flanks, which was intended to prevent the ships from being crushed by the pressure of the pack ice. In order to keep Erebus and Terror maneuverable in the drifting ice even when there is calm or unfavorable wind direction, an approximately 15-ton steam engine was installed in each of the ships, which drove a specially designed, two-meter-high propeller. They were the first ships in the Royal Navy to be equipped with steam propulsion and screw propellers. The propellers and rudders were mounted so that if they got stuck in the pack ice they could be removed and brought to safety. In retrospect, this additional drive was far too weak."

The name #YELLOW [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting] Expedition#! after their leader [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetFullName] has already established itself colloquially."
 rapanui.407.f: "In the first half of the 19th century, some parts of the Northwest Passage were explored separately by many expeditions, including those by John Ross, Elisha Kent Kane, William Edward Parry, and James Clark Ross; overland expeditions were also led by John Franklin, George Back, Peter Warren Dease, Thomas Simpson, and John Rae. In 1826 Frederick William Beechey explored the north coast of Alaska, discovering Point Barrow. In 1845, a lavishly equipped two-ship expedition led by Sir John Franklin sailed to the Canadian Arctic to chart the last unknown swaths of the Northwest Passage. Confidence was high, as they estimated there was less than 500 km (310 mi) remaining of unexplored Arctic mainland coast. When the ships failed to return, relief expeditions and search parties explored the Canadian Arctic, which resulted in a thorough charting of the region, along with a possible passage."
 rapanui.407.g: "Good luck!"

 rapanui.410.t: "Amundsen crosses the North West Passage"
 rapanui.410.d: "The Norwegian adventurer Roald Amundsen was the first person to sail through the Northwest Passage by boat. The campaign lasted three years. This is a great day for our country!"
 rapanui.410.f: "Amundsen managed to sail the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific with his wooden ship Gjøa and a crew of six between 1903 and 1906. However, the chosen route from Baffin Bay via Lancaster Sound and Peel Sound and further through James Ross Strait and Simpson Strait was unsuitable for regular shipping as the sea depth was less than one meter in places. However, this does not detract from the nautical and exploratory achievement of the six Norwegians and the Dane Godfred Hansen in conquering the Northwest Passage from east to west for the first time, which many expedition teams had attempted over more than four centuries. During their trip, Amundsen's expedition team found skeletal remains and equipment from John Franklin's lost expedition."
 rapanui.410.g: "Glory to Norway!"
 rapanui.411.t: "The Northwest Passage discovered!"
 rapanui.411.d: "The #YELLOW [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting] Expedition#! made a breakthrough in the Arctic Ocean between Canada and the Arctic, thereby proving that this sea route does not represent an insurmountable obstacle to progress. [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetFullName] Expedition is celebrated as a hero!"
 rapanui.411.f: "Crossing the Northwest Passage did not open up a new, profitable trade route, contrary to what was hoped for in its theoretical projections. Driving through the thick ice was far too risky for that. Possible overwintering delayed a crossing. Nevertheless, the discovery was a milestone. Previously unknown areas were mapped and travel to the North Pole or South Pole was no longer out of the question. Nautical, cartographic, meteorological, geomagnetic and biological knowledge was expanded. And for some brave adventurers, the area was no longer terra incognita."
 rapanui.411.g: "For the glory of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]!"
 rapanui.412.t: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting]'s Lost Expedition"
 rapanui.412.d: "It's been around 4 years since we haven't heard anything about the #YELLOW [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting] Expedition#!. The Admiralty therefore declared the expedition officially missing. The prevailing belief is that the crew and ship are trapped in the pack ice."
 rapanui.412.f: "A lost expedition does not necessarily mean that it is the worst possible case scenario. However, it is certain that the actual goal, the discovery and crossing of the Northwest Passage, has definitely failed. The fate of the crew is another story. If the #V Success Chance#! of the expedition was not too low, then there is hope that not everything is lost."
 rapanui.412.g: "That's not good news."

 rapanui.413.d: "To the happy surprise of all of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting], the #YELLOW [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting] Expedition#! has returned. The crew has suffered a few deaths and the ship is in poor condition, but it brought back valuable scientific knowledge."
 rapanui.413.f: "The McClure Arctic expedition, one of many attempts to find the missing Franklin expedition, was significant for being the first to successfully discover and transit the Northwest Passage, which it accomplished by both boat and sledging. However, it is precisely for this reason that it is doubtful whether this can be considered an actual passage. It was only Roald Amundsen who made the first real passage through the Northwest Passage between 1903 and 1905."
 rapanui.413.g: "What a relief!"
 rapanui.414.t: "Expedition members return"
 rapanui.414.d: "The meager remnant of what's left of the #YELLOW [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting] Expedition#! crossed the border into civilization in Canada a few days ago. The emaciated figures explained that they had to abandon the ships in the pack ice. The men saved what they needed on a few puny sledges. Captain [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetFullName] was seriously ill at times, but has now returned home safely. Other crew members did not survive cold, hunger, illness and exhaustion."
 rapanui.414.f: "In 1852 Edward Belcher was given command of the government Arctic expedition in search of Franklin. It was unsuccessful; Belcher's inability to render himself popular with his subordinates was peculiarly unfortunate on an Arctic voyage and he was not wholly suited to commanding vessels among ice. Four of the five ships (HMS Resolute, Pioneer, Assistance and Intrepid) were abandoned in pack ice, for which Belcher was court-martialled but acquitted. One of these ships, HMS Resolute, was eventually recovered intact by an American whaler and returned to the United Kingdom."
 rapanui.414.g: "At least, they are alive."
 rapanui.415.t: "No sign of the [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting] Expedition"
 rapanui.415.d: "After weeks of waiting, the terrible suspicion becomes clear that the expedition searching for the Northwest Passage will not return. We probably have to get used to the terrible certainty that this is one of the greatest tragedies in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] maritime history."
 rapanui.415.f: "The Franklin Expedition was the third major and final research trip by the British polar explorer Sir John Franklin. Their goal was to sail completely through the Northwest Passage from east to west for the first time, to map it and thus find a shorter sea route from Europe to Asia. The expedition failed disastrously; From 1845 to 1848 everyone involved died in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The last traces of the expedition members were only discovered many years later near King William Island. The tragic fate of the Franklin expedition, long obscured, attracted widespread attention in the mid-19th century. Newspapers achieved high circulation with reports and speculations about Franklin's fate and exploited the topic according to all the rules of modern mass media. The expedition itself, as well as Lady Jane Franklin's intensive efforts to save her husband by sending new search expeditions, occupied the British public for years."
 rapanui.415.g: "We have to accept that they are all dead..."
 rapanui.415.h: "Send a rescue mission!"
 rapanui.415.tt: "There is a small chance of finding the expedition members alive. In most cases we will find nothing, or at least a few remains. However, there is also the - very small - risk that this expedition could also go missing."

The bad weather meant that the mission had to be aborted to avoid suffering a similar fate."
 rapanui.417.f: "The members of the lost expedition are most likely dead and their ships sunk. However, the uncertainty leaves its mark. Stories are making the rounds in the press. Stories are told of cannibalism or demons, of good gentlemen who became wild animals and fell into madness. The fate of the #YELLOW [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting] Expedition#! will probably never be clarified and will provide material for many horror tales."

But alive. A little later, [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_hero').GetFullName] reached the home port with what was left of the crew. The rescue mission was a complete success."
 rapanui.418.f: "All ships of the #YELLOW [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting] Expedition#! were trapped in the pack ice. They had been abandoned months ago. The sick and weak who were left there met a certain death. Others died while marching with improvised sledges made from the ship's wood. Hunger and cold had claimed more victims. About one in three men had died. But the joy was even greater that at least they were able to return home - as if by a miracle, [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_hero').GetFullName] had found them in an ice-free bay and taken them on board. The important scientific findings of the successful expedition were also saved. Although [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_leader').GetFullName] has lost his fleet, he is celebrated at home along with [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_northwest_expedition_hero').GetLastName] as if he had crossed the passage."

It is to be feared that they both suffered the same fate."
 rapanui.419.f: "'Rae had heard from Eskimos in April 1854 at Pelly Bay (latitude 69° north, longitude 72° west) that 10-12 days' journey further west a number of more than 40 white men had died due to lack of food. Continuing his journey, he learned that in the spring of 1850 some Eskimos, who had gone out to catch seals near the northern shore of King William's Island, had seen about 40 white men migrating across the ice towards the south; A few weeks later, 30 bodies of white men were found on the coast of the American continent, a day's journey to the northwest of a large river, and 5 others on a nearby island. It turned out that the Eskimos had still found powder, bullets, shot, watches, compasses, telescopes and guns, since at least parts of these items, as well as silver spoons, forks, etc., were discovered and purchased by Rae.'"
