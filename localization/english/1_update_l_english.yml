Glass manufacturers in Joachimsthal (Bohemia) used this technique as early as 1826. Uranium was used to color glass until the middle of the 20th century, only then was it replaced by other, less harmful coloring minerals. Uranium-containing ceramic glazes ranging from orange to bright red were used on everything from tableware to architectural accessories. This ceramic, called 'Fiestaware' in the USA because of the name of a manufacturer, is probably one of the most radioactive items that can still be found in many American households."

 manzoni.3.d: "Fundamental changes in audience tastes, due to political, social and cultural changes in the country, have led to a change in the preference for a literary genre in [GetPlayer.GetName]."
 manzoni.3.f_juvenile: "In the 17th and 18th centuries, Puritans in England and America published children's books steeped in Protestant ethics. Some of the first children's books that had a purely educational message as well as entertainment value were published by John Newbery in the 1740s. A few years earlier, Thomas Boreman had written the Gigantick Histories. Nevertheless, moralistic values continued to shape many children's books until the late 19th century, although from the middle of the 18th century the purely religious message was increasingly replaced by the rational moralism propagated by Locke and Rousseau. From the middle of the 19th century, pure fantasy and adventure stories became more and more accepted as children's literature."
 manzoni.3.f_crime: "Even though the origins of the crime novel go back further, it only became established as a literary genre in the 19th century. It usually focuses on a crime and its prosecution and investigation by the police, a detective or a private individual. The possibilities of describing psychological moments that drive the criminal, providing descriptions of the environment or plunging the investigator into his own troubles of conscience were also processed in a sophisticated literary manner. Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment can be understood as a crime novel. The transition to thriller and mystery can be fluid."
 manzoni.3.f_adventure: "Adventure literature is as old as literature itself. Adventure literature can be traced back to antiquity, even to the Ancient Near East. The medieval Arthurian novel and chivalric novel are considered further forerunners of modern adventure novels. A variety of adventurous literature appeared from the 19th century onwards, the best-known representatives of which were Alexandre Dumas, Robert Louis Stevenson, Karl May and Jules Verne. "
 manzoni.3.f_science: "Even before the term science fiction was developed, visions of future technical developments can be found since the Middle Ages at the latest. The term itself was first used in 1851 by the British poet and essayist William Wilson. Parallel to the belief in science, fear of science and technology emerged in the 19th century. This belief and this fear merged into the epochally new and divided attitude to life of being a neo-mythical titan who is afraid of his own power. This is why dystopias emerged, such as those of Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. This ambivalence characterizes science fiction."
 manzoni.3.f_social: "The origins of modern social criticism go back at least to the Enlightenment period. Fictional literature can have a significant social impact. For example, the 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe furthered the anti-slavery movement in the United States. George Orwell and Charles Dickens wrote Animal Farm and A Tale of Two Cities, respectively, to express their disillusionment with society and human nature."
 manzoni.3.f_literary: "Literary fiction is often used as a synonym for literature, in the exclusive sense of writings specifically considered to have considerable artistic merit. Literary fiction includes classic books: that is works in any discipline that have been accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy. While literary fiction is commonly regarded as artistically superior to genre fiction, the two are not mutually exclusive."
 manzoni.3.f_devotional: "Devotional Literature originally describes popular writings with a religious motivation. It is not theological literature because it does not pursue scientific discourses and has no dogmatic intentions. Rather, with the changes of modern times there was a concentration on inwardness, which was characterized by increased piety. It was a guide to virtuous living that was intended to emotionally uplift the spirit."
 manzoni.3.f_romance: "The popular romance novel refers to an extensive genre of trivial literature that is aimed primarily at the female readership and whose structure mostly follows trivial, i.e. easily accessible, basic patterns. However, not every romance novel can be classified as trivial literature, as topics such as child deaths, abuse, fatal illnesses or similarly complex topics cannot be easily trivialized."

 manzoni.301.f: "The term bibliomania refers to an excessive passion for collecting books that exhibits hallmarks of addiction and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder. In contrast to harmless bibliophilia, which often accompanies the accumulation of a private library, bibliomania involves either the aspect of compulsive hoarding, the financial ruin caused by collecting, or the commission of crimes to satisfy bibliomania. The first known case of a criminal bibliomaniac in Germany was the Saxon priest Johann Georg Tinius. He embezzled church funds and committed several attempted robbery-murders (in which he used narcotics) to finance his passion for collecting. The auction catalog of Tinius' remaining library alone contained 16,650 works. An example of a bibliotaph is the Comte de Lignerolles, who supposedly withdrew completely from social life from 1848 and devoted himself only to expanding and maintaining his book collection, which he kept in one in a specially designed apartment in Paris. He did not share his knowledge with others and even denied owning certain books. The size and value of his collection only became apparent when the books were auctioned after his death."

 manzoni.303.f: "Though women had formed Bible study groups since the 1600s, it wasn't until the late 1700s that secular reading circles emerged in both America and Europe. Reading circles were not limited to particular races or classes, with one of the first reading groups for Black women being formed in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1827. Throughout the 1800s, women's reading circles expanded, with some becoming outspoken on social issues such as abolition—foreshadowing the club movement of the end of that century. Well into the 1900s, book clubs continued to serve as both an intellectual outlet and a radical political tool."

However, the small edition books have now become audience favorites, which is why the company has expanded its divisions and now wants to focus more on mass taste.

It seemed a stroke of luck that another publishing house was soon found that wanted to take over the entire company and promised that no cuts would be made. However, there is a catch. Behind the generous offer is [SCOPE.sCharacter('publisher_ig_leader').GetInterestGroup.GetName], which holds a large stake in the publisher. The corporate merger would therefore take place under the leadership of a political party. Critics have already noted that this could lead to a relevant influence on the media market that does not only affect the region.

We have been asked to stop this piracy."
 manzoni.323.f: "Unfortunately, in the 18th century it was still commonplace for authors and their publishers to be cheated out of their income because competitors copied works without the consent of the authors. From the 19th century onwards, improvements came into force that protected the rights of authors and publishers, but these improvements were often only possible at the national level. Publishers abroad often still printed copies and translations without the authors' consent. This even affected internationally renowned authors such as Jules Verne, whose books were distributed in English-speaking countries without permission and were sometimes massively altered."

Finding more planets might even help to unravel the mysteries of the universe.\n\n#b Historical Context:#! The 6 planets were known for a long time, as they were easy to observe even with bare eyes thanks to their brightness.
