 je_artists_realism: "Center of Realism"
 je_artists_realism_reason: "Realism as an art form is gaining increasing popularity. Painters in various places are already committed to this new school. However, realism still lacks its own, real center. The aversion of the traditional artistic elite to the new style has meant that it has so far only remained a phenomenon outside the academy. We need our own art academy that teaches this style, with a gallery where realistic painting finds its place - and of course a [concept_klimt_painter] who is the model figure of realism in our country."

 artists.2007.t: "The Center of Realism"
 artists.2007.d: "[SCOPE.sState('elgar_culture_capital').GetCityHubName] is developing into the center of the Expressionist style of art. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetLastFullName] played a significant role in this and is now considered a leading figure of the realistic school of painting."
 artists.2007.f: "In art history, realism refers to a new conception of art that began in Europe in the middle of the 19th century, which turned against representations of classicism and romanticism. In art, realism attempts to recreate reality as closely as possible. The artist's appropriation of reality and its subsequent transformation into a work of art as well as its political connotations are characteristic of realism. It promotes everydayness and objectivity. Its best-known representative was the French painter Gustave Courbet, who appropriated the term realistic art and used it for his art because of its provocative effect."
 artists.2007.g: "But can you find true beauty in reality?"
