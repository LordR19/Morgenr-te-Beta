 je_klimt_rossetti: "Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood"
 je_klimt_rossetti_reason: "The Pre-Raphaelites are a group of artists who see a cultural break in the Renaissance art of Raphael and Michelangelo. They prefer Italian painting from the Trecento and Quattrocento. They saw themselves as a reform movement. Their rivalry was less with the actual Renaissance artists than with the neoclassicists who modeled themselves on them. They particularly took up medieval subjects. One of its most famous representatives was Dante Gabriele Rossetti."
 je_klimt_fattori: "Macchiaioli"
 je_klimt_fattori_reason: "The Macchiaioli were a unique Italian artistic group who anticipated innovations in Impressionism, but remained largely unnoticed in their time. The term Macchiaioli is derived from the Italian word macchia, which means spot (a second meaning is scrub, maquis). Their most important representative was Giovanni Fattori."
 je_klimt_barbizon: "The Barbizon School"
 je_klimt_barbizon_reason: "The Barbizon School was formed by a group of French landscape painters towards the end of the first third of the 19th century. The artists stayed in the village of Barbizon near the Fontainebleau Forest. The painter's colony, which was founded by Théodore Rousseau and existed until around 1870, had a significant influence on landscape painting throughout Europe, especially impressionism."

 klimt.601.t: "The Death of [SCOPE.sCharacter('klimt_painter_scope').GetLastName]"
 klimt.601.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('klimt_painter_scope').GetFullName], a nationally and internationally highly regarded painter and one of our country's outstanding artistic personalities, died today. He leaves a gap that can hardly be filled."
 klimt.601.f: "On June 26, 1835, Caspar David Friedrich suffered a stroke with symptoms of paralysis. He took a cure in Teplitz, which he could only afford by selling some pictures about the poet Zhukovsky to the Russian tsar's court. After the treatment, Friedrich started painting again, which caused him difficulties. Nevertheless, the oil painting Seaside by Moonlight was created in 1835/36. Until 1839, he mostly produced sepia drawings and watercolors, fewer landscapes and more death allegories. Friedrich sent some sepia drawings to the Dresden art exhibitions in 1836 and 1838. In the last year of my life, work came to a standstill. Friedrich died at the age of 65 on May 7, 1840 in Dresden and was buried in the Trinity Cemetery."
 klimt.601.g: "But who is painting his death portrait now?"
 klimt.602.f: "As Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant. His father's death in 1829 had a profound effect on him, and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression. Turner died of cholera at the home of Sophia Caroline Booth, in Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, on 19 December 1851. He is buried in St Paul's Cathedral, where he lies near the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. Apparently his last words were "The Sun (or Son?) is God", though this may be apocryphal."
 klimt.603.f: "On February 6, 1848, the Cole family attended a morning service at Saint Luke's Episcopal Church in Catskill. After lunch, Cole complained of lassitude and by midnight his condition worsened and the doctor was summoned. An attack of pleurisy and congestion of his lungs followed. Thomas Cole died in the Main House at Cedar Grove at 8 pm on Friday, February 11th, 1848."
 klimt.604.f: "The winter of 1862/63 was extremely rough for Delacroix; he was suffering from a bad throat infection that seemed to get worse over the course of the season. On a trip to Champrosay, he met a friend on the train and became exhausted after having a conversation. On 1 June he returned to Paris to see his doctor. Two weeks later, on 16 June, he was getting better and returned to his house in the country. But by 15 July he was sick enough to again see his doctor, who said he could do nothing more for him. By then, the only food he could eat was fruit. Delacroix realized the seriousness of his condition and wrote his will, leaving a gift for each of his friends. For his trusted housekeeper, Jenny Le Guillou, he left enough money for her to live on while ordering everything in his studio to be sold. He also inserted a clause forbidding any representation of his features, 'whether by a death-mask or by drawing or by photography. I forbid it, expressly.' On 13 August, Delacroix died."
 klimt.605.f: "In the last years of his life, Eckersberg's eyesight began to fail. This eventually led to him having to give up painting altogether. He died in Copenhagen of cholera on July 22, 1853 during the great epidemic. He is buried in Copenhagen's Assistens Cemetery."
