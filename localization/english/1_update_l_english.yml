 klimt.1300.t: "Carl Spitzweg, The Poor Poet"
 klimt.1300.d: "The Poor Poet (German: Der arme Poet) is the best known and most popular painting by German painter Carl Spitzweg. It was executed in 1839 and had three versions. It is considered an early masterpiece."
 klimt.1300.f: "Carl Spitzweg was a German romanticist painter and poet. He is considered to be one of the most important artists of the Biedermeier era. His father, a wealthy merchant, had Carl trained as a pharmacist. He attained his qualification from the University of Munich, but while recovering from an illness he also took up painting. Spitzweg was self-taught as an artist, and began by copying the works of Flemish masters. He contributed his first work to satiric magazines. Upon receiving an inheritance in 1833, he was able to dedicate himself to painting. His later paintings and drawings were often humorous genre works. Many of his paintings depict sharply characterized eccentrics."
 klimt.1300.g: "Ahahah, a funny painter!"
 klimt.1300.h: "Wait! Satire against whom?"

He realized that globally distributed measurements would have to be carried out at the same time in order to be able to localize the causes of the fluctuations and measure the static field more precisely. From 1836 onwards, the Magnetic Association founded for this purpose and the British Royal Society provided data that he and Wilhelm Weber evaluated. The aim was to measure the fluctuations of the earth's magnetic field in a coordinated manner using numerous measuring stations distributed all over the world. Up to 50 observatories took part in this project, including 35 in Europe, six in Asia, two in Africa, three in North America and four in Oceania. The results were delivered to Göttingen and scientifically processed by Gauß and Weber."

Together with Weber, he published the results in six volumes under the title 'Results from the Observations of the Magnetic Association'. Maps were published in an additional volume that gave the magnetic data valid at the time for every location on the globe.

The first telegram in the United States was sent by Morse on 11 January 1838, across two miles (3 km) of wire at Speedwell Ironworks near Morristown, New Jersey, although it was only later, in 1844, that he sent the message "WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT" over the 44 miles (71 km) from the Capitol in Washington to the old Mt.

Wireless telegraphy claimed Dr. Braun's full attention in 1898, and for many years after that he applied himself almost exclusively to the task of solving its problems.

However, the project was stopped after about 9.3 miles of wire was laid because the line was failing. Morse learned that Cooke and Wheatstone were using poles for their lines in England and decided to follow their lead. A test of the still incomplete line occurred on May 1, 1844, when news of the Whig Party's nomination of Henry Clay for U.S. President was sent from the party's convention in Baltimore to the Capitol Building in Washington.
