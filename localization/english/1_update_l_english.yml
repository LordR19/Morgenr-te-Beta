The question remains whether the theory is also recognized by the scientific community."
 agassiz.401.f: "From the beginning of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, the determination of the age of the earth remained vague and was, for the most part, subject to repeated debates and hostility. The question of the age of the earth was often related to the question of evolution, because this needed a sufficiently long period of time to function as a theory. Until the turn of the century, many scientists believed that the Earth was only a few million years old - at the end of his life, Lord Kelvin only assumed it was 20 million years old. But even Charles Darwin, who was one of the 'maximalists' who defended his thesis, believed in around 300 million years. It was not until the discovery of radioactivity that the age of the Earth could be correctly determined and the true extent of the age of the Earth (and therefore of the entire solar system) became known."

 agassiz.501.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has just published a book in which he puts forward a thesis that is already highly controversial. Accordingly, the continents in their current form are of more recent geological origin. Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] postulates that today's continents formed a unit he calls 'Pangea'. In order to convince the international geological community of this thesis, he invited them to a congress."
 agassiz.501.f: "The oldest suggestion that continental drift was the cause came from the Flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius. In the 1596 edition of his Atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, the similarity of the two coastlines can already be clearly seen. Alexander von Humboldt described the similarity of the opposite coasts of South America and Africa and their vegetation in 1801 and 1845 and speculated that the Atlantic was washed out by a catastrophic current. In 1858, geographer Antonio Snider-Pellegrini went a step further when he published the first map showing the Old and New Worlds without a separating ocean. However, it was above all Alfred Wegener who, with his theory of continental drift, led to a rethinking from fixism (the thesis that the continents are firmly rooted in the earth) to mobilism. During his lifetime, however, his explanation model remained a minority opinion in science, which only became established in the second half of the 20th century."

But the opponents are numerous and do not want to deviate from the prevailing doctrine of fixism."
 agassiz.504.f: "Fixism was the key geotectonic hypothesis until the 1960s. It was assumed that the earth's crust was firmly connected to the subsoil, so that large-scale tectonic processes were local. From this it followed that the development of the earth was predominantly characterized by vertical and very little by horizontal tectonic movements of the earth's crust. Most theories of classical geology were based on the idea of fixism. At the beginning of the 10th century, fossils of the same species were found in South America and Africa. Under the assumption of fixism, the land bridge hypothesis was put forward, according to which there were once land bridges connecting Africa to South America, allowing animals to migrate to the other continent. Through the echo sounder measurements of the research ship Meteor between 1924 and 1927, during which the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - an undersea mountain range that runs from north to south - was discovered and not, as expected, the remnants of a land bridge that should have run from east to west, the land bridge hypothesis began to falter but was not completely abandoned until the 1960s. The opposite of fixism is mobilism, which sees horizontal movements of the earth's crust as having a decisive influence. The theory of mobilism developed from Alfred Wegener's discovery of continental drift."

 verrier.511.f: "'I repeated the examination in the early part of the night of 11th [August 1877], and again found nothing, but trying again some hours later I found a faint object on the following side and a little north of the planet. I had barely time to secure an observation of its position when fog from the River stopped the work. This was at half-past two o'clock on the night of the 11th. Cloudy weather intervened for several days. On 16 August the object was found again on the following side of the planet, and the observations of that night showed that it was moving with the planet and if a satellite, was near one of its elongations. Until this time I had said nothing to anyone at the Observatory of my search for a satellite of Mars, but on leaving the observatory after these observations of the 16th, at about three o'clock in the morning, I told my assistant, George Anderson, to whom I had shown the object, that I thought I had discovered a satellite of Mars.' -Asaph Hall"

 verrier.511.f: "'On 17 August [1877] between one and two o'clock, while I was reducing my observations, Professor Newcomb came into my room to eat his lunch and I showed him my measures of the faint object near Mars which proved that it was moving with the planet. On 17 August while waiting and watching for the outer moon, the inner one was discovered. The observations of the 17th and 18th put beyond doubt the character of these objects and the discovery was publicly announced by Admiral Rodgers.' -Asaph Hall"

 verrier.521.f: "Amalthea was discovered on September 9, 1892 using a 91 cm telescope from the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton (California, USA) by astronomer Edward E. Barnard during a systematic search for additional moons of Jupiter. It was the fifth moon of Jupiter discovered after the first observation of the four Galilean moons in 1610. As the fifth moon of Jupiter to be discovered, Amalthea was systematically named Jupiter V because the Roman numeral V represents the number 5. The French astronomer Camille Flammarion suggested naming the moon Amalthea, which is why this name was in unofficial use for decades until it was officially named."
 verrier.522.t: "Himalia discovered"
 verrier.522.d: "[ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s months-long search has paid off: [ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] has discovered a previously unknown satellite in the orbit of Jupiter! The celestial body was named #YELLOW Himalia#!."
 verrier.522.f: "Himalia is the largest of the outer or irregular moons of the planet Jupiter. Himalia was discovered on December 3, 1904 by astronomer Charles Dillon Perrine at the Lick Observatory (San Jose, California). The moon was named after the nymph Himalia, a lover of Zeus from Greek mythology."

 verrier.523.f: "Elara was discovered on January 2, 1905 by astronomer Charles Dillon Perrine at the Lick Observatory (San Jose, California). It is the second largest of the outer or irregular moons and the eighth largest moon of the planet Jupiter. The moon was named after Elara, a lover of Zeus from Greek mythology."
 verrier.524.t: "Pasiphae discovered"
 verrier.524.d: "[ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s months-long search has paid off: [ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] has discovered a previously unknown satellite in the orbit of Jupiter! The celestial body was named #YELLOW Pasiphae#!."
 verrier.524.f: "Pasiphae was discovered on January 27, 1908 by astronomer Philibert Jacques Melotte. It was first found on photographic plates exposed at the Royal Greenwich Observatory (England) on the night of February 28, 1908. Examination of other plates showed that the object had already been recorded on January 27th. Since it was initially not clear whether it was an asteroid or a moon, it was given the provisional asteroid designation 1908 CJ. On April 10th, the discovery of an eighth moon near Jupiter was finally confirmed. The moon was named after Pasiphae, the wife of Minos and mother of the Minotaur from Greek mythology. Pasiphae is the namesake of a group of Jupiter's moons that move on similar orbits. The Pasiphae group consists of thirteen members, with Pasiphae being the largest."
 verrier.525.t: "Sinope discovered"
 verrier.525.d: "[ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s months-long search has paid off: [ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] has discovered a previously unknown satellite in the orbit of Jupiter! The celestial body was named #YELLOW Sinope#!."
 verrier.525.f: "Sinope was discovered on July 1, 1914 by astronomer Seth Barnes Nicholson at Lick Observatory. The moon was named after Sinope, a nymph from Greek mythology who was courted by Zeus and kidnapped by Apollo. Sinope is assigned to the Pasiphae group due to its orbital properties."
 verrier.526.t: "Lysithea discovered"
 verrier.526.d: "[ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s months-long search has paid off: [ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] has discovered a previously unknown satellite in the orbit of Jupiter! The celestial body was named #YELLOW Lysithea#!."
 verrier.526.f: "Lysithea was discovered on July 6, 1938 by astronomer Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory. The moon was named after Lysithea, a lover of Zeus from Greek mythology. Due to its orbital properties, it is assigned to the Himalia group, named after Jupiter's moon Himalia."
 verrier.527.t: "Carme discovered"
 verrier.527.d: "[ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s months-long search has paid off: [ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] has discovered a previously unknown satellite in the orbit of Jupiter! The celestial body was named #YELLOW Carme#!."
 verrier.527.f: "Carme was discovered on July 30, 1938 by astronomer Seth Barnes Nicholson at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California. Nicholson photographed Jupiter between July 5 and August 25, with Carme visible on a photographic plate exposed on July 30. The discovery of a new moon near Jupiter was then announced at the end of August of that year. The moon was named after Carme, a lover of Zeus from Greek mythology."
