 agassiz_seismology_tech: "Seismology"
 agassiz_seismology_tech_desc: "In response to a series of earthquakes near Comrie in Scotland in 1839, a committee was formed in the United Kingdom in order to produce better detection methods for earthquakes. The outcome of this was the production of one of the first modern seismometers by James David Forbes. From 1857, Robert Mallet laid the foundation of modern instrumental seismology and carried out seismological experiments using explosives. He is also responsible for coining the word 'seismology'."

 je_agassiz_geological_research: "Geological Research"
 je_agassiz_geological_research_reason: "A geologist who can devote himself entirely to his geological studies is primarily interested in minerals. If the geologist has the Mineralogist trait, the country will receive twice the number of minerals it normally receives each year. If this is not the case, then the geologist will receive the mineralogist trait at the end of his five-year research period.

Geologists can find access to formations, caves or uranium during these five years. If no state has such special features, other geological events can also occur."
 je_agassiz_geological_research_goal: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] can spend five years undisturbed with extremely boring rock formations."

 agassiz.301.t: "Geological research completed"
 agassiz.301.d: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has completed his five-year research work in the field of extremely boring rock formations and depressive-looking hilly landscapes and is returning to the university at his leisure to torment students there with equally exciting lectures."
 agassiz.301.f: "'The entire universe has been neatly divided into things to (a) mate with, (b) eat, (c) run away from, and (d) rocks.' -Terry Pratchett"
 agassiz.301.g: "More stones for everyone!"

 agassiz.401.t: "A New Calculation"
 agassiz.401.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has summarized all of [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] previous experiences and knowledge throughout [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] life to provide a new estimate of the age of the Earth. The question remains whether the theory is also recognized by the scientific community."
 agassiz.401.f: "From the beginning of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, the determination of the age of the earth remained vague and was, for the most part, subject to repeated debates and hostility. The question of the age of the earth was often related to the question of evolution, because this needed a sufficiently long period of time to function as a theory. Until the turn of the century, many scientists believed that the Earth was only a few million years old - at the end of his life, Lord Kelvin only assumed it was 20 million years old. But even Charles Darwin, who was one of the 'maximalists' who defended his thesis, believed in around 300 million years. It was not until the discovery of radioactivity that the age of the Earth could be correctly determined and the true extent of the age of the Earth (and therefore of the entire solar system) became known."
 agassiz.401.g: "Send the paper to all well-known geologists worldwide."
 agassiz.402.t: "A Geologist presents a New Calculation"
 agassiz.402.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has proposed a calculation of the real age of the Earth. The scientist considers the previous measurement to be incorrect and estimates the age of the earth to be significantly higher. Since our geologist is one of the esteemed representatives of this subject, we were also sent a copy of the thesis."
 agassiz.402.g: "These calculations are convincing."
 agassiz.402.h: "Who is supposed to believe this pseudo-geological nonsense?"
 agassiz.403.t_yes: "Geological Study Accepted"
 agassiz.403.d_yes: "Fortunately, the majority of the International Geological Society rated our geologist's new calculations as a milestone and recognized his theory as valid."
 agassiz.403.f_yes: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName]'s estimate for determining the Earth's age was accepted by a majority. [GetGlobalVariable('agassiz_age_of_earth_yes_global_var').GetValue|+0] scientists #G accepted#! the study, [GetGlobalVariable('agassiz_age_of_earth_no_global_var').GetValue|+0] #R rejected#! it. This meant that the theory was officially recognized and the age of the Earth was significantly increased."
 agassiz.403.g: "A triumph for Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName], a triumph for geology!"
 agassiz.403.t_no: "Geological Study Rejected"
 agassiz.403.d_no: "The ignorant, so-called 'elite' of international geologists have rejected our geologist's new study. We have yet to determine whether there was fraud in the election or whether it was a hostile maneuver to undermine our proud nation."
 agassiz.403.f_no: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName]'s estimate for determining the Earth's age was rejected by the majority. [GetGlobalVariable('agassiz_age_of_earth_yes_global_var').GetValue|+0] scientists #G accepted#! the study, [GetGlobalVariable('agassiz_age_of_earth_no_global_var').GetValue|+0] #R rejected#! it. The previous assessment of the age of the Earth therefore remains the same."
