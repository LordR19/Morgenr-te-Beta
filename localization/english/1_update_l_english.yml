### Concepts ###
 concept_verrier_astronomical_prestige: "Astronomical Prestige"
 concept_verrier_astronomical_prestige_desc: "#b Astronomical Prestige#! is the amount of [concept_prestige] you gain from Astronomy. Various factors influence your #b Astronomical Prestige#!:\n- Finding a new Planet will grant you between #V 15#! and #V 100#! Prestige depending on the difficulty to find it.\n- Each discovered [concept_verrier_satellite] will grant you 10 Prestige.\n- A great Comet will grant you 10 Prestige.\n- Every [concept_verrier_meteorite] will grant you #V 1#! Prestige.\n- Every #V 100#! [Concept('concept_verrier_astronomical_object','$concept_verrier_astronomical_objects$')] will grant you #V 1#! Prestige."

 concept_verrier_moon_photo_desc: "If you have an [concept_verrier_observatory] and researched the Camera Technology, you will be able to order your [concept_verrier_astronomer] to begin photographing the Moon. This will reduce the amount of [Concept('concept_verrier_astronomical_object','$concept_verrier_astronomical_objects$')] from your #b Astronomer#! but give you #b Moon Photos#! every year.\nIf you collect enough #b Moon Photos#!, you will create an accurate map of Earth's Companion. Completing the Moon Map will grant your nation some [concept_verrier_astronomical_prestige]" #Please replace

 concept_verrier_satellite: "Satellite"
 concept_verrier_satellites: "Satellites"
 concept_verrier_satellite_desc: "#b Satellites#! or Moons are [Concept('concept_verrier_astronomical_object','$concept_verrier_astronomical_objects$')] that are orbiting a planet. Some #b Satellites#! like the Earth's Moon are already discovered, but an [concept_verrier_astronomer] can try to find more of them.\nEach #b Satellite#! discovered by your country will grant it a small amount of [concept_verrier_astronomical_prestige]."

 concept_agassiz_volcano_desc: "#b Volcanoes#! are a new state trait in #r Morgenröte#!. Unlike the base game for Victoria 3, it is not strategic regions but rather states with volcanoes that are tied to whether a volcanic eruption takes place. The volcanic activity is significantly greater, but it is not always destructive. In countries with volcanoes, a #b $building_agassiz_volcano_observatory$#! can be built, which not only helps to predict and mitigate eruptions through observations, but is also the starting point for a volcano expedition. [Concept('concept_agassiz_geologist','$concept_agassiz_geologists$')] can acquire new [concept_agassiz_geological_knowledge], [Concept('concept_agassiz_rare_mineral','$concept_agassiz_rare_minerals$')], experience and the volcanologist trait on a volcano expedition." #Please replace

 concept_agassiz_geological_knowledge: "Geological Knowledge"
 concept_agassiz_geological_knowledge_desc: "#b Geological Knowledge#! includes a nation's general understanding of the nature of the earth. It is a very rare resource that can be acquired primarily in the course of geological milestones. #b Geological Knowledge#! is not the same as the [concept_agassiz_geological_score], but it is the most important component of it and is considered particularly valuable."
 concept_agassiz_geological_score: "Geological Score"
 concept_agassiz_geological_score_desc: "The #b Geological Score#! includes all of a nation's achievements and knowledge that are related to geology. The most important component is [concept_agassiz_geological_knowledge], but there are many other important factors; such as the experience of a [concept_agassiz_geologist], [agassiz_oceanographic_knowledge], the number of [Concept('concept_agassiz_mineral','$concept_agassiz_minerals$')], [Concept('concept_dubois_fossil','$concept_dubois_fossils$')] or [Concept('concept_dubois_specimen','$concept_dubois_specimens$')], and geological technologies. The Geological Score is crucial for re-dating the [concept_agassiz_age_of_earth]."
 agassiz_oceanographic_knowledge: "Oceanographic Knowledge"
 agassiz_oceanographic_knowledge_desc: "#b Oceanographic Knowledge#! forms part of [concept_agassiz_geological_knowledge] and corresponds to knowledge about the seas, in particular ocean currents, but also general marine research combined with geophysical considerations. #b Oceanographic Knowledge#! is largely gained on [Concept('concept_dubois_pacific_expedition','$concept_dubois_pacific_expeditions$')]. 50 #b Oceanographic Knowledge#! is necessary to acquire [concept_agassiz_geological_knowledge]."
 concept_agassiz_age_of_earth: "Age of the Earth"
 concept_agassiz_age_of_earth_desc: "One of the big questions of the 19th century was the question of the #b Age of the Earth#!. It had natural history implications, particularly regarding the validity of the theory of evolution and the sequence of geological events. Only a [concept_agassiz_geologist] can determine a new earth age. To do this, his nation must have a higher [concept_agassiz_geological_score] than the nation that last determined an Earth age. He will then share his research results with other colleagues. He doesn't necessarily have to be successful - geologists who are too young and inexperienced will not be heard. However, foreign nations are a little more accommodating when no new theory has been presented for many years. Geologists can only estimate the age of the Earth once in their lives - but this only applies if they are successful. If you fail, you can try again after a phase of motivation."
 concept_agassiz_geology: "Geology"
 concept_agassiz_geology_desc: "#b Geology#! is one of the main features of [concept_morgenroete]. Even before the beginning of the Victorian Age, geology had already experienced a significant boom, which is why it is available to many nations at the start of the game.\n\n[Concept('concept_agassiz_geologist','$concept_agassiz_geologists$')] can be used in a variety of ways: they can find [Concept('concept_dubois_formation','$concept_dubois_formations$')], [Concept('concept_lepsius_cave','$concept_lepsius_caves$')] and [concept_curie_uranium] deposits during a geological search, go on [concept_agassiz_volcano] expeditions, determine [concept_agassiz_age_of_earth], find new ore and oil deposits or go on [concept_dubois_pacific_expedition] and [concept_dubois_mountaineering] expeditions useful as scientific companions. A [concept_agassiz_geological_score] evaluates the overall knowledge of a nation and is crucial in determining the age of the earth. [Concept('concept_agassiz_mineral','$concept_agassiz_minerals$')] and [Concept('concept_agassiz_rare_mineral','$concept_agassiz_rare_minerals$')] are an essential part of geology; The latter can be used to establish a mineral cabinet in the [concept_dubois_zoo]. A special geological facility is the #b $building_agassiz_volcano_observatory$#!, which carries out volcanological and seismic studies."

 ### Agassiz ###
 agassiz_seismology_tech: "Seismology"
 agassiz_seismology_tech_desc: "In response to a series of earthquakes near Comrie in Scotland in 1839, a committee was formed in the United Kingdom in order to produce better detection methods for earthquakes. The outcome of this was the production of one of the first modern seismometers by James David Forbes. From 1857, Robert Mallet laid the foundation of modern instrumental seismology and carried out seismological experiments using explosives. He is also responsible for coining the word 'seismology'."

 je_agassiz_geological_research: "Geological Research"
 je_agassiz_geological_research_reason: "A geologist who can devote himself entirely to his geological studies is primarily interested in minerals. If the geologist has the Mineralogist trait, the country will receive twice the number of minerals it normally receives each year. If this is not the case, then the geologist will receive the mineralogist trait at the end of his five-year research period. Geologists can find access to formations, caves or uranium during these five years. If no state has such special features, other geological events can also occur."
 je_agassiz_geological_research_goal: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] can spend five years undisturbed with extremely boring rock formations."

 agassiz.301.t: "Geological research completed"
 agassiz.301.d: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has completed his five-year research work in the field of extremely boring rock formations and depressive-looking hilly landscapes and is returning to the university at his leisure to torment students there with equally exciting lectures."

The question remains whether the theory is also recognized by the scientific community."
 agassiz.401.f: "From the beginning of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, the determination of the age of the earth remained vague and was, for the most part, subject to repeated debates and hostility. The question of the age of the earth was often related to the question of evolution, because this needed a sufficiently long period of time to function as a theory. Until the turn of the century, many scientists believed that the Earth was only a few million years old - at the end of his life, Lord Kelvin only assumed it was 20 million years old. But even Charles Darwin, who was one of the 'maximalists' who defended his thesis, believed in around 300 million years. It was not until the discovery of radioactivity that the age of the Earth could be correctly determined and the true extent of the age of the Earth (and therefore of the entire solar system) became known."
 agassiz.401.g: "Send the paper to all well-known geologists worldwide."
 agassiz.402.t: "A Geologist presents a New Calculation"
 agassiz.402.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_geologist_scope').GetLastName] has proposed a calculation of the real age of the Earth. The scientist considers the previous measurement to be incorrect and estimates the age of the earth to be significantly higher.

 agassiz.403.t_no: "Geological Study Rejected"
 agassiz.403.d_no: "The ignorant, so-called 'elite' of international geologists have rejected our geologist's new study. We have yet to determine whether there was fraud in the election or whether it was a hostile maneuver to undermine our proud nation."
 agassiz.403.f_no: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName]'s estimate for determining the Earth's age was rejected by the majority.

 je_agassiz_advanced_oceanography: "Advanced Oceanography"
 je_agassiz_advanced_oceanography_reason: "After the previous oceanographic studies were primarily intended to bring practical benefit to the military in order to strategically exploit the current conditions of the Pacific, scientists have now advocated using the findings of marine research to learn more about our planet - purely for the sake of knowledge."
 je_agassiz_advanced_oceanography_success: "We will finish our studies if we have gained #G 50#! @rapanui_oceanographic_knowledge! #E Oceanographic Knowledge#!."

 agassiz.313.f: "A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is usually crystalline and formed by geological processes. The majority of the approximately 6,000 mineral species known today and recognized as independent are inorganic, but some organic substances such as mellite and evenkite or the kidney stone formers whewellite and weddellite are also recognized as minerals because geological processes were also involved in their formation. Including all known mineral varieties and synonymous names as well as mineral species that are not yet recognized, there are over 7,000 mineral names."

 agassiz.11.t: "The Dynamics of Earthquakes"
 agassiz.11.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has attracted international attention today because [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] has revolutionized previous knowledge of this aspect of geology with a book about earthquakes. Words [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] coined such as 'epicenter' and 'seismology' have already found their way into science."
 agassiz.11.f: "On February 9, 1846, Robert Mallet presented his work 'The Dynamics of Earthquakes' to the Royal Irish Academy, which is considered one of the foundations of modern seismology. Between 1852 and 1858, with the help of his son John William Mallet, he prepared the British Association's Earthquake Catalog, which appeared in 1858 and listed the known earthquakes and described their effects. During this time he also carried out explosion experiments to determine the travel time of seismic waves in loose and solid rock."

 agassiz.501.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has just published a book in which he puts forward a thesis that is already highly controversial. Accordingly, the continents in their current form are of more recent geological origin. Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] postulates that today's continents formed a unit he calls 'Pangea'. In order to convince the international geological community of this thesis, he invited them to a congress."
 agassiz.501.f: "The oldest suggestion that continental drift was the cause came from the Flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius. In the 1596 edition of his Atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, the similarity of the two coastlines can already be clearly seen. Alexander von Humboldt described the similarity of the opposite coasts of South America and Africa and their vegetation in 1801 and 1845 and speculated that the Atlantic was washed out by a catastrophic current. In 1858, geographer Antonio Snider-Pellegrini went a step further when he published the first map showing the Old and New Worlds without a separating ocean. However, it was above all Alfred Wegener who, with his theory of continental drift, led to a rethinking from fixism (the thesis that the continents are firmly rooted in the earth) to mobilism. During his lifetime, however, his explanation model remained a minority opinion in science, which only became established in the second half of the 20th century."

 agassiz.504.t: "Fixism or Mobilism?"
 agassiz.504.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_alfred_wegener_scope').GetFullName] gave a highly acclaimed lecture to the assembled international geological community in which [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_alfred_wegener_scope').GetSheHe] vehemently advocates the reversal of geology to mobilism - that is, continental drift. But the opponents are numerous and do not want to deviate from the prevailing doctrine of fixism."
 agassiz.504.f: "Fixism was the key geotectonic hypothesis until the 1960s. It was assumed that the earth's crust was firmly connected to the subsoil, so that large-scale tectonic processes were local. From this it followed that the development of the earth was predominantly characterized by vertical and very little by horizontal tectonic movements of the earth's crust. Most theories of classical geology were based on the idea of fixism. At the beginning of the 10th century, fossils of the same species were found in South America and Africa. Under the assumption of fixism, the land bridge hypothesis was put forward, according to which there were once land bridges connecting Africa to South America, allowing animals to migrate to the other continent. Through the echo sounder measurements of the research ship Meteor between 1924 and 1927, during which the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - an undersea mountain range that runs from north to south - was discovered and not, as expected, the remnants of a land bridge that should have run from east to west, the land bridge hypothesis began to falter but was not completely abandoned until the 1960s. The opposite of fixism is mobilism, which sees horizontal movements of the earth's crust as having a decisive influence. The theory of mobilism developed from Alfred Wegener's discovery of continental drift."

Its resplendency is so intense, that for the first time the earth illuminates the sky, and gives it the appearance of continued lightning; the sky, in its turn reflects this lustre upon the water, and thus nature seems to be set in flames by this three-fold image of fire.' -Germaine de Staël"

 agassiz.614.f: "Volcanic gases are gases that emerge from the earth's surface during volcanic activity. Emergence can occur either in narrowly defined areas or diffusely over a large area from the flanks of a volcano. Volcanic gases were collected and analyzed as long ago as 1790 by Scipione Breislak in Italy. The composition of volcanic gases is dependent on the movement of magma within the volcano. Therefore, sudden changes in gas composition often predict a change in volcanic activity."

It split, and crackled, and sparkled, and smoked and flamed up and ever moved on in one vast compact body. Pieces detaching themselves rolled down, leaving behind a glare so fierce that I could have imagined myself at the mouth of an iron furnace; and as every mass fell down with the noise of thunder the trees flamed up, and the crowds uttered shouts of admiration and regret.' -Luigi Palmieri"

 agassiz.619.f: "Most volcanic rocks share a number of common minerals. Differentiation of volcanic rocks tends to increase the silica (SiO2) content mainly by fractional crystallization. Thus, more evolved volcanic rocks tend to be richer in minerals with a higher amount of silica such as phyllo and tectosilicates including the feldspars, quartz polymorphs and muscovite. While still dominated by silicates, more primitive volcanic rocks have mineral assemblages with less silica, such as olivine and the pyroxenes. Bowen's reaction series correctly predicts the order of formation of the most common minerals in volcanic rocks. Occasionally, a magma may pick up crystals that crystallized from another magma; these crystals are called xenocrysts. Diamonds found in kimberlites are rare but well-known xenocrysts; the kimberlites do not create the diamonds, but pick them up and transport them to the surface of the Earth."

The doctrine, therefore, that volcanoes are safety-valves, and that the subterranean convulsions are probably most violent when first the volcanic energy shifts itself to a new quarter, is not modern.' -Charles Lyell"

 agassiz.625.f: "'If we skirt the fertile region at the base of Etna on its southern and eastern sides, we behold marine strata of clay sand, and volcanic tuff, cropping out from beneath the modern lavas. The marine fossil shells occurring in these strata are all of them, or nearly all, identical with species now inhabiting the Mediterranean; and as they appear at the height of from 600 to 800 feet above the sea near Catania, they clearly prove that there has been in this region, as in other parts of Sicily farther to the south, an upward movement of the ancient bed of the sea.

In 1845 he took over Pasquale Galluppi's teaching position in logic and metaphysics at the University of Naples. After Gallupi's death in 1847, his chair was entrusted to him. In 1860 he gave up the chair and instead took over the chair of geophysics and meteorology that he had initiated. Attached to the chair were the meteorological observatory and the Vesuvius Observatory, founded in 1842, which Palmieri also took over management. He headed the chair and the two observatories until his death. Palmieri became known in particular for improved measuring devices, such as an electromagnetic seismograph and devices for measuring electrical voltages in the atmosphere.

Upon closer examination of the volcanic vent, Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] found that there were boxes and sacks with private belongings there, including the bag of an academic. Inside was a diary - belonging to Professor Otto Lidenbrock. Lidenbrock was a Hamburg geologist and mineralogist specializing in volcanism and subterranean cave systems.

As [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetSheHe] was to tell us later, there was one passage that had intrigued [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetHerHim] for months. In addition to personal notes, a much older manuscript page was found between the pages. Creator: a 16th-century Icelandic alchemist named Arne Saknussemm. He left a mysterious inscription on runes that turned out to be more difficult to crack than [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetFullName] first thought. Then, as if by intuition, [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetSheHe] solved the riddle. As it turned out, [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetSheHe] was right. The book had a secret; a mystery so great and monstrous that it shook [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetHerHim] to the core. Because the alchemist's message was: \n\n 'Go down into the crater of Snaefells Jökull, which Scartaris's shadow caresses just before the calends of July, O daring traveler, and you'll make it to the center of the earth. I've done that.' \n\n What got [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetFullName] even more excited: Lidenbrock had added new runes to the text with his own handwriting. They were: 'And me too'. For the geologist it is clear that these sensational statements require scientific verification. [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetSheHe|U] has therefore demanded that we support [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetHerHis] trip to Iceland - [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetSheHe] wants to travel to the center of the earth [SCOPE.sCharacter('agassiz_journey_coe_leader').GetHerselfHimself]!"

 agassiz.911.f: "It would not be easy to lose your way in Rejkiavik. I was therefore under no necessity to inquire the road, which exposes one to mistakes when the only medium of intercourse is gesture. The town extends along a low and marshy level, between two hills. An immense bed of lava bounds it on one side, and falls gently towards the sea. On the other extends the vast bay of Faxa, shut in at the north by the enormous glacier of the Snæfell, and of which the Valkyria was for the time the only occupant. Usually the English and French conservators of fisheries moor in this bay, but just then they were cruising about the western coasts of the island. The longest of the only two streets that Rejkiavik possesses was parallel with the beach. I had soon explored these melancholy ways; here and there I got a glimpse of faded turf, looking like a worn-out bit of carpet, or some appearance of a kitchen garden, the sparse vegetables of which, would have figured appropriately upon a Lilliputian table. A few sickly wallflowers were trying to enjoy the air and sunshine. In three hours I had seen not only the town but its environs. The general aspect was wonderfully dull. No trees, and scarcely any vegetation. Everywhere bare rocks, signs of volcanic action."

 agassiz.912.t: "Snaefells Jökull"
 agassiz.912.d: "The team has reached the crater of the Icelandic volcano and is about to descend."
 agassiz.912.f: "Supper was rapidly devoured, and the little company housed themselves as best they could. The bed was hard, the shelter not very substantial, and our position an anxious one, at five thousand feet above the sea level. Next morning we awoke half frozen by the sharp keen air, but with the light of a splendid sun. I rose from my granite bed and went out to enjoy the magnificent spectacle that lay unrolled before me. I raised my head and saw straight above me the upper aperture of the cone, framing a bit of sky of very small circumference, but almost perfectly round. Just upon the edge appeared the snowy peak of Saris, standing out sharp and clear against endless space. I had not yet ventured to look down the bottomless pit into which I was about to take a plunge. The supreme hour had come. I have already mentioned that it was a hundred feet in diameter, and three hundred feet round. I bent over a projecting rock and gazed down. My hair stood on end with terror. The bewildering feeling of vacuity laid hold upon me. I felt my centre of gravity shifting its place, and giddiness mounting into my brain like drunkenness."
 agassiz.912.g: "Was it really all such a good idea?"
 agassiz.913.t: "Search for water"
 agassiz.913.d: "After descending into the volcano, water supplies run out. After only a few days, the journey is already in serious danger."
 agassiz.913.f: "Never had mineralogists found themselves in so marvellous a situation to study nature in situ. What the boring machine, an insensible, inert instrument, was unable to bring to the surface of the inner structure of the globe, we were able to peruse with our own eyes and handle with our own hands. Through the beds of schist, coloured with delicate shades of green, ran in winding course threads of copper and manganese, with traces of platinum and gold. I thought, what riches are here buried at an unapproachable depth in the earth, hidden for ever from the covetous eyes of the human race! About six o'clock this brilliant fête of illuminations underwent a sensible abatement of splendour, then almost ceased. As I had foretold, the water failed entirely by the end of the first day's retrograde march. Our fluid aliment was now nothing but gin; but this infernal fluid burned my throat, and I could not even endure the sight of it. I found the temperature and the air stifling. Fatigue paralysed my limbs. More than once I dropped down motionless. Then there was a halt; and my uncle and the Icelander did their best to restore me. But I saw that the former was struggling painfully against excessive fatigue and the tortures of thirst.  We arrived on our hands and knees, and half dead, at the junction of the two roads. There I dropped like a lifeless lump, extended on the lava soil."
 agassiz.913.g: "We are too deep in the earth - we have to look for water there."
 agassiz.913.h: "We need to get back to the surface and look for water there."
 agassiz.914.t: "Mare internum"
 agassiz.914.d: "After following a stream through the cave system, the travelers encounter a vast subterranean sea."
 agassiz.914.f: "As if by a miracle we found water: a torrent led cold water deep into the earth's interior and filled our supplies. But when we followed it and came to its end, an even greater surprise awaited us. At first I could hardly see anything. My eyes, unaccustomed to the light, quickly closed. When I was able to reopen them, I stood more stupefied even than surprised.  A vast sheet of water, the commencement of a lake or an ocean, spread far away beyond the range of the eye, reminding me forcibly of that open sea which drew from Xenophon's ten thousand Greeks, after their long retreat, the simultaneous cry, 'Thalatta! thalatta!' the sea! the sea! The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine shining sand, softly lapped by the waves, and strewn with the small shells which had been inhabited by the first of created beings. The waves broke on this shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to vast inclosed spaces.  It was quite an ocean, with the irregular shores of earth, but desert and frightfully wild in appearance. It will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven days in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to breathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles."
 agassiz.914.g: "Build a raft."
 agassiz.915.t: "The Giant"
 agassiz.915.d: "Runic marks on mysterious, primeval giant mushrooms suggest that Arne Saknussemm was here. But in order to find evidence for the thesis, one would have to go past a gigantic, uncanny prehistoric man."
 agassiz.915.f: "The diffused light revealed the smallest object in the dense and distant thickets. I had thought I saw - no! I did see, with my own eyes, vast colossal forms moving. They were gigantic animals; it was a herd of mastodons - not fossil remains, but living and resembling those the bones of which were found in the marshes of Ohio in 1801. I saw those huge elephants whose long, flexible trunks were grouting and turning up the soil under the trees like a legion of serpents. I could hear the crashing noise of their long ivory tusks boring into the old decaying trunks. I looked, shaking my head incredulously. But though at first I was unbelieving I had to yield to the evidence of my senses. In fact, at a distance of a quarter of a mile, leaning against the trunk of a gigantic kauri, stood a human being, the Proteus of those subterranean regions, a new son of Neptune, watching this countless herd of mastodons. Yes, truly, huger still himself. It was no longer a fossil being like him whose dried remains we had easily lifted up in the field of bones; it was a giant, able to control those monsters. In stature he was at least twelve feet high. His head, huge and unshapely as a buffalo's, was half hidden in the thick and tangled growth of his unkempt hair. It most resembled the mane of the primitive elephant. In his hand he wielded with ease an enormous bough, a staff worthy of this shepherd of the geologic period."
 agassiz.915.g: "We have to take the risk."
 agassiz.915.h: "This is too dangerous - return to the surface, now!"
 agassiz.916.t: "Arne Saknussemm's Manuscript"
 agassiz.916.d: "After having escaped the giant human beeing, the travelers found a gallery with the initials of Arne Saknussem everywhere. After some searching, they find proof that the Icelandic alchemist was really here - the legendary manuscript was found deep within the earth!"
 agassiz.916.f: "In another quarter of an hour our nimble heels had carried us beyond the reach of this horrible monster. And yet, now that I can reflect quietly, now that my spirit has grown calm again, now that months have slipped by since this strange and supernatural meeting, what am I to think? what am I to believe? I must conclude that it was impossible that our senses had been deceived, that our eyes did not see what we supposed they saw. No human being lives in this subterranean world; no generation of men dwells in those inferior caverns of the globe, unknown to and unconnected with the inhabitants of its surface. It is absurd to believe it! I had rather admit that it may have been some animal whose structure resembled the human, some ape or baboon of the early geological ages, some protopitheca, or some mesopitheca, some early or middle ape like that discovered by Mr. Lartet in the bone cave of Sansau. But this creature surpassed in stature all the measurements known in modern palæontology. But that a man, a living man, and therefore whole generations doubtless besides, should be buried there in the bowels of the earth, is impossible. However, we had left behind us the luminous forest, dumb with astonishment, overwhelmed and struck down with a terror which amounted to stupefaction. We kept running on for fear the horrible monster might be on our track. It was a flight, a fall, like that fearful pulling and dragging which is peculiar to nightmare. And, wonderfully interested, we peered all along the high wall, peeping into every fissure which might open out into a gallery. There, upon a granite slab, appeared two mysterious graven letters, half eaten away by time. They were the initials of the bold and daring traveller: 'A. S.,' shouted my uncle. 'Arne Saknussemm! Arne Saknussemm everywhere!'"
 agassiz.916.g: "Finally - it's ours!"
 agassiz.917.t: "Journey to the Center of Earth vanishes"
 agassiz.917.d: "The journey to the center of the earth has failed. We suspect that all members of the expedition died of thirst due to lack of water."
 agassiz.917.f: "It was eight in the evening. No signs of water had yet appeared. I was suffering horribly. My uncle strode on. He refused to stop. He was listening anxiously for the murmur of distant springs. But, no, there was dead silence. And now my limbs were failing beneath me. I resisted pain and torture, that I might not stop my uncle, which would have driven him to despair, for the day was drawing near to its end, and it was his last. At last I failed utterly; I uttered a cry and fell. 'Come to me, I am dying.' My uncle retraced his steps. He gazed upon me with his arms crossed; then these muttered words passed his lips: 'It's all over!' The last thing I saw was a fearful gesture of rage, and my eyes closed."
 agassiz.917.g: "What a tragedy!"
 agassiz.918.t: "Stromboli"
 agassiz.918.d: "The journey to the center of the earth was a complete success - our scientists have returned safely as heroes after an eruption of Stromboli volcano!"
 agassiz.918.f: "I have a confused impression left of continuous explosions, loud detonations, a general shaking of the rocks all around us, and of a spinning movement with which our raft was once whirled helplessly round. It rocked upon the lava torrent, amidst a dense fall of ashes. Snorting flames darted their fiery tongues at us. There were wild, fierce puffs of stormy wind from below, resembling the blasts of vast iron furnaces blowing all at one time; and I caught a glimpse of the figure of Hans lighted up by the fire; and all the feeling I had left was just what I imagine must be the feeling of an unhappy criminal doomed to be blown away alive from the mouth of a cannon, just before the trigger is pulled, and the flying limbs and rags of flesh and skin fill the quivering air and spatter the blood-stained ground. \n\n When I opened my eyes again I felt myself grasped by the belt with the strong hand of our guide. I found myself lying on the sloping side of a mountain only two yards from a gaping gulf, which would have swallowed me up had I leaned at all that way. Above our heads, at a height of five hundred feet or more, we saw the crater of a volcano, through which, at intervals of fifteen minutes or so, there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire, mingled with pumice stones, ashes, and flowing lava. I could feel the heaving of the mountain, which seemed to breathe like a huge whale, and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes. Beneath, down a pretty steep declivity, ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred feet, giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet. But the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich verdure, amongst which I was able to distinguish the olive, the fig, and vines, covered with their luscious purple bunches."
 agassiz.918.g: "What an adventure!"

The seismometer is a first step towards better detecting earthquakes."
 agassiz.801.f: "In response to a series of earthquakes near Comrie in Scotland in 1839, a committee was formed in the United Kingdom in order to produce better detection devices for earthquakes. The outcome of this was an inverted pendulum seismometer constructed by James David Forbes, first presented in a report by David Milne-Home in 1842, which recorded the measurements of seismic activity through the use of a pencil placed on paper above the pendulum. The designs provided did not prove effective, according to Milne's reports. It was Milne who coined the word seismometer in 1841, to describe this instrument."

It is significantly superior to the previous seismometer and can detect earthquake areas much better. This enables us to make more precise preparations for emergencies."
 agassiz.802.f: "The first seismographs were invented in the 1870s and 1880s. The first seismograph was produced by Filippo Cecchi in around 1875. However, the instrument was not sensitive enough, and the first seismogram produced by the instrument was in 1887, by which time John Milne had already demonstrated his design in Japan. In 1880, the first horizontal pendulum seismometer was developed by the team of John Milne, James Alfred Ewing and Thomas Gray, who worked as foreign-government advisors in Japan, from 1880 to 1895. Milne, Ewing and Gray, all having been hired by the Meiji Government in the previous five years to assist Japan's modernization efforts, founded the Seismological Society of Japan in response to an Earthquake that took place on February 22, 1880, at Yokohama."

Geysers depend on three factors: a water supply in the form of an aquifer, a heat source, and at least one reservoir with a constriction to the associated plumbing system. Over 300 active geysers, about half of all existing in the world, are located in Yellowstone National Park."

Barnard during a systematic search for additional moons of Jupiter. It was the fifth moon of Jupiter discovered after the first observation of the four Galilean moons in 1610. As the fifth moon of Jupiter to be discovered, Amalthea was systematically named Jupiter V because the Roman numeral V represents the number 5. The French astronomer Camille Flammarion suggested naming the moon Amalthea, which is why this name was in unofficial use for decades until it was officially named."

 verrier.524.f: "Pasiphae was discovered on January 27, 1908 by astronomer Philibert Jacques Melotte. It was first found on photographic plates exposed at the Royal Greenwich Observatory (England) on the night of February 28, 1908. Examination of other plates showed that the object had already been recorded on January 27th. Since it was initially not clear whether it was an asteroid or a moon, it was given the provisional asteroid designation 1908 CJ. On April 10th, the discovery of an eighth moon near Jupiter was finally confirmed. The moon was named after Pasiphae, the wife of Minos and mother of the Minotaur from Greek mythology. Pasiphae is the namesake of a group of Jupiter's moons that move on similar orbits. The Pasiphae group consists of thirteen members, with Pasiphae being the largest."

 verrier.531.f: "Enceladus was discovered on August 28, 1789 by the German-British astronomer Wilhelm Herschel. Enceladus is the sixth discovered moon of Saturn and the twelfth discovered moon (other than Earth's moon) in the entire solar system. Due to its orbit being the second closest to Saturn at the time, it was classified as the second innermost of the seven large moons of Saturn known to date. The moon was named after the giant Onkelados (Latin form: Enceladus) from Greek mythology. The name Enceladus, as well as names for seven other moons of Saturn, were suggested by Wilhelm Herschel's son, astronomer John Herschel."

 verrier.534.f: "Phoebe was discovered by William Henry Pickering on 18 March 1899 from photographic plates that had been taken starting on 16 August 1898 at the Boyden Observatory near Arequipa, Peru, by DeLisle Stewart. It was the first satellite to be discovered photographically. Phoebe is named after Phoebe, a Titaness in Greek mythology associated with the Moon, who was the sister of Cronus. 'In 1900, even I', Pickering stated, 'began to wonder if the four images of 1898 might not, after all, have been defects or faint stars occuring by a curious coincidence.' However, Pickeirng found Phoebe again. He believed he discovered a tenth Saturnian moon in 1905 from plates taken in 1904, which he called 'Themis'. For this discovery he was awarded the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1905. 'Themis' was later shown to not exist."

It was discovered by William Herschel on January 11, 1787, the same day he discovered Uranus's second largest moon, Oberon. He later reported the discoveries of four more satellites, although they were subsequently revealed as spurious. For nearly the next 50 years, Titania and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel's, although the moon can be seen from Earth with a present-day high-end amateur telescope. All of Uranus's moons are named after characters created by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. The name Titania was taken from the Queen of the Fairies in A Midsummer Night's Dream."

 verrier.545.f: "Miranda was discovered on 16 February 1948 by planetary astronomer Gerard Kuiper using the McDonald Observatory's 82-inch (2,080 mm) Otto Struve Telescope. Its motion around Uranus was confirmed on 1 March 1948. It was the first satellite of Uranus discovered in nearly 100 years. Kuiper elected to name the object 'Miranda' after the character in Shakespeare's The Tempest, because the four previously discovered moons of Uranus, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon, had all been named after characters of Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. However, the previous moons had been named specifically after fairies, whereas Miranda was a human."

 verrier.551.t: "Triton discovered"
 verrier.551.d: "[ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s months-long search has paid off: [ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] has discovered a previously unknown satellite in the orbit of Neptune! The celestial body was named #YELLOW Triton#!."
 verrier.551.f: "Triton is the largest natural satellite of the planet Neptune. It is the only moon of Neptune massive enough to be rounded under its own gravity and hosts a thin but well-structured atmosphere. Triton orbits Neptune in a retrograde orbit—an orbit in the direction opposite to the parent planet's rotation—the only large moon in the Solar System to do so. Triton was discovered by British astronomer William Lassell on October 10, 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, he wrote to Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell discovered Triton eight days later. A brewer by trade, Lassell spotted Triton with his self-built 61 cm (24 in) aperture metal mirror reflecting telescope (also known as the 'two-foot' reflector). Triton is named after the Greek sea god Triton, the son of Poseidon (the Greek god corresponding to the Roman Neptune)."
 verrier.552.t: "Nereid discovered"
 verrier.552.d: "[ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s months-long search has paid off: [ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] has discovered a previously unknown satellite in the orbit of Neptune! The celestial body was named #YELLOW Nereid#!."
 verrier.552.f: "Nereid is the third-largest moon of Neptune. It was discovered on 1 May 1949 by Gerard P. Kuiper using photographic plates taken with the 82-inch telescope at the McDonald Observatory. He proposed the name in the report of his discovery. It is named after the Nereids, sea-nymphs of Greek mythology and attendants of the god Neptune. It was the second, and last, moon of Neptune to be discovered before the arrival of Voyager 2."

 verrier.49.t: "Sun Spots"
 verrier.49.d: "Researchers at our observatory have observed unusual solar activity associated with sunspots."
 verrier.49.f: "Sunspots are dark spots on the sun's visible surface (photosphere) that are cooler and therefore emit less visible light than the rest of the surface. Their number and size form the simplest measure of so-called solar activity. The frequency of sunspots has a periodicity of an average of eleven years, which is called the sunspot cycle. The cause of the spots and the eruptions that occur near them are strong magnetic fields, which in some areas hinder the transport of heat from the interior to the sun's surface. A few unknown spots were discovered."
 verrier.49.g: "Fascinating!"
