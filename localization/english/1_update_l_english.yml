 dubois.271.d: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] today invited a group of colleagues to visit the new Prehistoric Scenery. The academics praised [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_paleontologist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] sense of detail."
 dubois.271.f_cretaceous: "The climate in the Cretaceous was generally warm and balanced. It enabled some dinosaurs to reach high southern and northern latitudes, at least during the summer months. The poles were ice-free and the sea level was correspondingly very high, reaching its maximum value in the Lower Turonian. It was only at the end of the Cretaceous in the Maastrichtian that cooling and a marked regression occurred. As in the preceding Jurassic period, the terrestrial macrofauna and megafauna were dominated by dinosaurs. In the Lower Cretaceous, club moss plants, ferns, tree ferns, ginkgoales, Bennettitales, and conifers were the predominant plants. In the Upper Cretaceous, many deciduous trees such as maple, oak and walnut competed with conifers such as Sequoia and Geinitzia. Grasses spread across the mainland and greatly changed erosion behavior."
 dubois.271.f_jurassic: "The Lower Jurassic period may have ended with massive eruptions in a large magmatic province on Gondwana. This led to global warming, coupled with a second-order mass extinction. Small-leaved, drought-adapted conifers then became an important part of the flora and modern sauropods developed among the dinosaurs. The Jurassic period, especially the late Jurassic period (Upper Jurassic), saw the first heyday of dinosaurs, with large theropods such as Allosaurus and giant sauropods such as Diplodocus and Giraffatitan. The flora was dominated by the gymnosperms (including the coniferous plants such as sequoias and pines, but also ginkgo trees and cycads). The Jurassic is also known as the age of cycads because they were very common. Ferns and horsetails formed the understory of the forests."
 dubois.271.f_triassic: "During the Triassic, a warm climate prevailed almost continuously, although this was subject to strong fluctuations at the beginning of the period. The climate also seems to have been rather dry worldwide: The reason was the shape of the supercontinent Pangea and a resulting monsoon effect. There were probably extensive deserts inland. The turn from the Permian to the Triassic is associated with a pronounced faunal change. This is so drastic that, due to the significantly changed fossil record, the turn from the Permian to the Triassic is not only the boundary between two periods, but also between two eras of earth's history, the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic. As a result, numerous groups of marine invertebrates disappear completely or permanently from the fossil record. The terrestrial vertebrate fauna is also undergoing significant changes. The change in the plant world from ferns to gymnosperms that had already taken place in the Permian continued in the Triassic."

 dubois.274.f: "Dinosaur Court in Crystal Palace Park in south London is a geological and paleontological theme park. It is known for the animal sculptures, which were created by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins in the middle of the 19th century as the world's first life-size figurative representations of extinct animals. The park was intended to serve both the amusement and education of its Victorian visitors. On the islands of the lake in the part of the complex designed as an English landscape garden, a theme park was designed that reflected the geological history of Britain. According to a concept based on the geologist David Thomas Ansted, each of the three islands was assigned to an era of the Phanerozoic and was designed with the sediments that originated in that period. Hawkins was advised by paleontologist Richard Owen. Although the prehistoric animals no longer corresponded to the state of research in the same century, they aroused great interest and provided large parts of the population with a basic level of paeontological knowledge."

 panum.201.g: "The white death seems unstoppable."
 panum.202.t: "A Hereditary Disease?"
 panum.202.d: "Despite all medical examinations, the origin of tuberculosis still remains a controversial area. Some of our medical staff assume that this is a hereditary disease, or at least one based on 'internal factors'. Other doctors are of the opinion that it is a classic, contagious disease and recommend radical measures."
 panum.202.f: "Regarding the concept of pathogenesis, different traditions existed in the European countries of the 18th and 19th centuries. Many medical authors of that time considered tuberculosis, or consumption, which was not always synonymous with it, to be the worst of the epidemics known at the time. They saw the causes as an unequal distribution of bodily humors, ominous exhalations from the soil, urbanization or the decline of customs. In Italy, on the other hand, there was a traditional tendency towards a contagious, i.e. h. transmittable cause. Consequently, in the middle of the 18th century, the Republic of Venice introduced the written obligation to report cases of phthisis (consumption due to pulmonary tuberculosis). The personal belongings of those who died of the disease were burned to reduce the risk of infection. In England and the Nordic countries, however, it was generally believed that the disease was due to a hereditary cause."
 panum.202.g: "It is a hereditary disease and there is nothing we can do."
 panum.202.h: "It is a contagious disease and we must do everything we can to stop it from spreading!"
 panum.203.t: "Spitting on the Streets"
 panum.203.d: "Due to the lack of knowledge about the causes of tuberculosis, the measures were also controversial. Those who assumed a contagious cause advocated radical bans - including spitting in public areas - to prevent the spread. This particularly affected the lower classes. Skeptics saw such regulations as just a way to harass ordinary people."
 panum.203.f: "Even if the rules of etiquette of the 18th century eradicated some 'bad habits' in the upper and middle classes, many hygienically dubious quirks remained widespread among the masses for a long time. Handkerchiefs and spittoons had not yet become widespread in society at the beginning of the 19th century, and it was only around the turn of the century that it became common practice to ban spitting on public transport, for example."
 panum.203.g: "Ban this disgusting habit!"

 panum.204.d: "The tuberculosis epidemic has also affected our artist [SCOPE.sCharacter('disease_victim_scope').GetFullName]! Surprisingly, [SCOPE.sCharacter('disease_victim_scope').GetSheHe] doesn't see it as the worst stroke of fate."
 panum.204.f: "At the beginning of the 19th century, but also well beyond, tuberculosis was considered a 'romantic disease'. It gave the victim enough time to prepare for death, and many saw the associated pallor as nothing short of noble. Writers created monuments to her with several works, such as Dumas the Younger with the 'Lady of the Camellias'. She finds similar transfiguration in the operas of Verdi (La Traviata) and Puccini (La Bohème). George Sand, Chopin's partner, is said to have noted: 'Chopin coughs with infinite grace.'"

 panum.205.d: "In view of the tuberculosis epidemic raging in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName], one of the doctors there has suggested that some wealthy patients be transferred to the mountains. The high altitude climate and the cleansing air are said to cure them of the disease. There should be a dedicated pulmonary sanatorium for this purpose, which would remain a respected institution in our country in the future. He suggested [SCOPE.sState('panum_davos_scope').GetName] as the perfect place for such a sanatorium."
 panum.205.f: "The air cure is a form of climatic therapy that was considered the standard therapy for tuberculosis for a long time from the 19th century onwards. The patients lay on deck chairs outdoors or in open lounges for several hours a day. The air treatment was carried out in special pulmonary sanatoriums. In Germany, the doctor Hermann Brehmer was the first to describe the previously incurable disease tuberculosis as curable with the help of air therapy. In 1856 he wrote his dissertation on the curability of chronic tuberculosis of the lungs. He assumed that there are 'immune places' that, on the one hand, due to their climate, effectively protect the residents from the occurrence of tuberculosis and, on the other hand, have a healing effect after the disease breaks out. In Switzerland, the German-born doctor Alexander Spengler was a pioneer of air therapy. He began practicing as a country doctor in Davos in 1853 and soon came to the conclusion that the residents of the area generally did not suffer from tuberculosis, which he attributed to the high mountain climate. Thomas Mann glorified Davos as a climatic health resort in his 'Zauberberg'."

 panum.206.f: "Tuberculosis gained widespread interest in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the endemic disease of the urban poor. In 1815 a quarter of deaths in England and in 1918 in France a sixth of deaths were caused by tuberculosis. Around 1880, every second death in Germany in the 15 to 40 age group was due to this disease."
