Glass manufacturers in Joachimsthal (Bohemia) used this technique as early as 1826. Uranium was used to color glass until the middle of the 20th century, only then was it replaced by other, less harmful coloring minerals. Uranium-containing ceramic glazes ranging from orange to bright red were used on everything from tableware to architectural accessories. This ceramic, called 'Fiestaware' in the USA because of the name of a manufacturer, is probably one of the most radioactive items that can still be found in many American households."
