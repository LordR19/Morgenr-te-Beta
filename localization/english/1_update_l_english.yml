Dufour and his team worked on the map from 1832 until 1865. The first two sheets were published in 1845 and the last of the 25 sheets was published in 1865. The topographic map was printed using a engraving print process and showed a scale of 1:100,000. Interestingly Dufour was the first general of modern Switzerland and lead the Swiss army against the Sonderbund in the Swiss civil war (Sonderbundskrieg) in 1848.\n\n#b Today #! the Carte Dufour is located at the Schweizer Landesmuseum in Zürich.

 dufour.902.d: "While they were surveying from one of the tall mountains of [SCOPE.sState('dufour_mapping_scope').GetName], our surveyors were surprised by a thunderstorm. It stormed and poured with rain. The surveyors sought shelter in their tent but a lightning strike killed one of them and injured the other."

 dufour.905.h: "Frau!"

 dufour.910.t: "First Sheets published: Jura and Basel"
 dufour.910.d: "The first few sheets of our new topographic map were published they are focusing on the area around Basel and the Jura."
 dufour.910.f: "The Jura is a range of small mountains that stretches from Savoy all the way to Basel and some Foothills even to Lake Constance. It encompases parts of Vaud, Neuchâtel, Bern, both Basel, Solothurn and Aaargau. many big cities are close to the Jura.\n Basel for example is one of the most important cities of Switzerland. Basel borders both the Alsace as well as Baden and is well connected thanks to the Rhine River.\nJust a few years ago the Canton of Basel was divided into the Cantons of Basel Stadt (City) and Basel Land (Countryside). Interestingly the countryside was more liberal during that time, while the city was ruled by Patricians. Basel is a quite international and has an old University that harbored great thinkers like Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli.\nGeneva on the other hand is a big city surrounded by France. during Napoléon's reign it was part of France and returned to Switzerland in 1815. Now the first private banks get founded and Geneva slowly becomes a hub of the financial sector. Additionally it was home to Voltaire and Jean-Jaques Rousseau, two of Switzerland's greatest philosophers."
 dufour.910.g: "Interesting!"
 dufour.910.h: "I do not want to hear anything about Switzerland!"
 dufour.910.no_more_information_tt: "You will #n no longer#! receive events that only describe Switzerland without any effects."

 dufour.911.t: "New Sheets published: Schaffhausen, Thurgau and St. Gallen"
 dufour.911.d: "More sheets were published. This time the focus lies on north and eastern Switzerland with the Cantons of Schaffhausen, Thurgau and St. Gallen."
 dufour.911.f: "Schaffhausen lies in the Northeast of Switzerland and is mostly surrounded by Germany. The city itself is located right nex to the Rhine and very close to the Rhinefalls at Neuhausen. Thanks to the energy of the river, Schaffhausen was able to industrialize quite early and thanks to the rural people it become a liberal Canton in 1831.\nThurgau was ruled by another Canton that changed every year until the French Revolution spread to Switzerland. It is a full Canton since 1815 and a center of textile industries and agriculture. The high amount of pear trees lead to the name \"Mostindien\" meaning Cider India which is a play on Ost (east) and Most (Cider). Thurgau is one of the liberal Cantons since 1831 and wants more centralization in Switzerland.\nSt. Gallen is a split Canton in regards to religion and was once the seat of monastery and a Prince Bishopric. It is a center of the textile industry and a liberal Canton. The Canton of St. Gallen surrounds both Appenzell Cantons and the remarkable Säntis mountain range, a part of the Alps."

 dufour.912.t: "New Sheets published: Grisons and the Rhaetian Alps"
 dufour.912.d: "More sheets were published. This time the focus lies on the huge Canton of Grisons and the Rhaetian Alps."
 dufour.912.f: "Grisons is not only the biggest Canton of Switzerland, it is also home to the Rumantsch speaking people, a minority in Switzerland and one group of the Alpine Romance language also found in South Tyrol and Friuli.\nGrisons is sparsely populated as it is dominated by the Alps. Particularily the Rhaetian Alps named after the ancien Rhaeti tribes. Grisons is mostly an agrarian Canton that profits from the transport of goods over the Alpine passes as well. The loss of some now Italian lands after the Napoleonic Wars was a catastrophe but Grisons still has some areas that have a majority of Italian speaking people making it a Canton with three language groups: German, Rumantsch and Italian\nPolitically Grisons is dominated by its municipalities that have a lot of power. But the liberal forces that want to centralize the Canton more gained ground lately."

 dufour.913.t: "New Sheets published: Central Switzerland"
 dufour.913.d: "More sheets were published. This time the focus lies on the many Cantons of Central Switzerland."
 dufour.913.f: "Central Switzerland is the birthplace of the \"Eidgenossenschaft\", the Swiss Confederation. First the Cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Underwalden (today separated in Nied- and Obwalden) formed a loose alliance which later was expanded more and more.\nThe main part of the economy of the many small Cantons in central Switzerland is the transport of goods mainly on the Gotthard route. Apart from that agriculture, logging and some textile production were important in the region.\nPolitically central Switzerland was dominated by conservative catholics. While the Canton of Luzern was the most liberal out of the Cantons in Central Switzerland thanks to the City of Luzern, the smaller Cantons of Uri, Schwyz, Ob- and Nidwalden, Glarus and Zug were even more conservative and dominated by the local upper classes.\nSchwyz was nearly split into two Cantons in the 1830s, when the outer parts of the Canton demanded equality and political participation. After inner Schwyz was occupied by troops of the Tagsatzung (the \"government\" of Switzerland) inner Schwyz agreed to those points in the end and Schwyz stayed one Canton."

 dufour.914.t: "New Sheets published: Ticino"
 dufour.914.d: "More sheets were published. This time the focus lies on the southernmost Canton of Switzerland, Ticino."
 dufour.914.f: "Ticino is the only remaining possession of the Swiss Confederation in Italy. As a conquest of the 15th and 16th centuries, the area was dominated by the old places (Cantons) until the founding of the Helvetic Republic. Since 1803, however, it has been a fully-fledged canton.\nThe dominant economic sectors in Ticino were agriculture and logging. Silk production was also a lucrative business. Agricultural products that did not grow elsewhere in Switzerland could be cultivated in Ticino: chestnuts, tobacco, silk and various fruits, for example.\nIn 1830 Ticino was one of the first Cantons to gain a liberal constitution. The political situation in the Canton however is unstable as the liberals want to centralize the state while the conservatives prefer regional autonomy."

 dufour.915.t: "New Sheets published: Bern and Friboug"
 dufour.915.d: "More sheets were published. This time focused on Bern and Fribourg."
 dufour.915.f: "Both the Canton of Bern and the Canton of Fribourg have French and German speaking parts. While Bern is a huge Canton Fribourg is a lot smaller. Bern reaches from the Jura mountain range all the way to the Alps in the south. Fribourg is located west of Bern and hosts towns like Fribourg and Gruyère where a well known chesse comes from.\nThe Canton of Bern is mostly dominated by agriculture but But watchmaking has slowly spread from neighboring Neuchâtel to the Bernese Jura. Hopefully industrialization will soon help develop the Canton.\nPolitically Bern was long dominated by the Patricians of the city itself but in the 1830s the liberals from the smaller towns in the Canton were able to draw up a new constitution that balanced the rights of the people of Berne and the rural population.\nFribourg is a Canton dominated by agriculture, especially grain production and cheese. The cheese from Gruyère is especially well known.\nPolitically, Fribourg was dominated by the conservative Patricians and the Clergy. Even when a new constitution was issued in 1831, the Canton remained conservative and in the elections the conservatives still gained the majority of the votes."

 dufour.916.t: "New Sheets published: Zürich and Aargau"
 dufour.916.d: "More sheets were published. This time focused on Zürich and Aargau."
 dufour.916.f: "Both Zürich and Aargau are located in the north of Switzerland mostly in the relatively flat Mittelland (central land). Both Cantons are rapidly industrializing and might become industrial powerhouses quite soon.\nZürich is one of the old Cantons and was dominated by the city itself for quite a long time. Zürich is a center of the mechanized textile industry as well as the machine industry. Many factories are located at rivers and get their energy from those rivers.\nPolitically Zürich was dominated by the Patricians of the City until 1830/31 when the people of the countryside forced a new constitution to be enacted. In the next elections, the liberals and radicals gained a majority and are now dominating the politics in Zürich.\nAargau was ruled by the other Cantons until the time of the Helvetic Republic. Now that it is a full Canton, Aaargau is industrializing fast, especially with textile factories. The many rivers of Aargau allowed for factories to get their energy from the water and lead to many decentralized factories.\nAargau was basically counterweight to the cantons of Zurich and Bern and nearly did not become a full Canton in 1814/15. Even after 1815 Aargau stayed quite liberal unlike other Cantons. In 1831, a new constitution gave the population even more rights. The government responded to the resistance of the Catholic population to the increased control of the church by the state by occupying rebellious regions."

 dufour.917.t: "New Sheets published: Vaud and Valais"
 dufour.917.d: "More sheets were published. This time focused on Vaud and Valais."
 dufour.917.f: "Valais is a big valley in the very south of Switzerland mostly seperated from the rest of the country by the Alps. The Rhône river flows through the valley and then into the Lac Léman. The Northern coast of the Lake is part of Vaud, but the Canton extends from Geneva and the Alps to the Jura.\nVaud is still dominated by agriculture but the liberals started to implement changes to grow the industry since 1826. Time will tell if Vaud will remain an agricultural Canton or become a center of industry.\nThanks to diplomatic skill, the canton of Vaud was confirmed after Napoleon's defeat. In return, however, the canton had to accept a more conservative constitution. Thanks to the authoritarian leadership, the liberals gained ground and were able to push through a new constitution in 1830. In the meantime, the radicals were gaining ground and trying to promote democratization.\nValais is dominated by agriculture and its rural population. There is no significant industry and outside connections are limited.\nThe main political conflict in Valais was the one between the german speaking upper Valais and the french speaking lower Valais. Upper Valais has been the dominant part of the Canton even though the Lower Valais had a higher population. The question is whether the liberals and radicals of the lower valley are in a position to promote the democratization of Valais or whether the old forces can stabilize their rule."

 je_manzoni_italian_national_identity: "Italian Identity"
 je_manzoni_italian_national_identity_reason: "After a few years of growing together and a few reforms, the feeling of being connected to a pan-Italian identity is increasingly spreading among the general population. This feeling will spread from region to region, no matter how the state sets the right framework: regions that are well served by government administrations, universities, barracks or naval bases are more likely to develop an all-Italian identity due to their integrative function. Heavily urbanized areas are more likely to find access to a concept that was previously only researched by intellectuals. Under perfect circumstances, one sub-state could adopt the new identity every year. If all Italians in the nation state feel like they are, this will also have an influence on the Italians abroad, who will then increasingly feel like our countrymen abroad rather than as Lombards, Sicilians or Tuscans."

 manzoni.914.f: "Even before the unification of Italy, the intellectual elite in particular had mostly identified themselves as Italian and viewed regional origins only as folklore. From the moment of unification, this awareness spread particularly in the Italian military - the army and the navy became the 'school of the nation'. In politics, the centralist forces prevailed over the regionalist forces early on."

 manzoni.915.t: "Brigands in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_brigant_state').GetName]"
 manzoni.915.d: "The poor conditions in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_brigant_state').GetName] have led to more and more people with no prospects joining the [SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_brigant_character').GetFullName] gang. They are now wreaking havoc in the surrounding area - to such an extent that the brigands have become a real problem. There are even supporters among the common people who see them as opponents of the government and increasing Italianization, and therefore as political and regional resisters."
 manzoni.915.f: "Brigandage in Southern Italy had existed in some form since ancient times. However its origins as outlaws targeting random travellers would evolve vastly later on in the form of the political resistance movement. After the conquest of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies in 1861 by the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia (later Kingdom of Italy), the most famous and well known form of brigandage in the area emerged. Amongst the brigands were a mixture of people, with different working backgrounds and motives; the brigands included former prisoners, bandits and other people who the Italian government regarded as common criminals, but also former soldiers and loyalists of the Bourbon army. They launched attacks not only against the Italian authorities and the land owning upper-classes, but also against common people, frequently looting villages, towns and farms, and committing armed robberies against both individuals and groups, including farmers, townspeople and rival brigand bands."
 manzoni.915.g: "Another bandit masquerading as Robin Hood!"
 manzoni.916.t: "Fear for regional heritage"
 manzoni.916.d: "Ordinary people in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_regionalist_state').GetName] fear that the new national Italian institutions and the popularization of the Italian language could destroy the traditional way of life there. [SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_rural_leader_scope').GetFullName] has argued that the region's special heritage should not be ignored and that the homogenization of Italy has already progressed too far."
 manzoni.916.f: "With the failed revolution of 1848/1849, the Neo-Guelphs, as the leading arm of the Italian unity movement, became de facto powerless. They had originally spoken out in favor of a federally structured Italy under the primus inter pares presidency of the Pope. In response, centralist circles gained absolute preeminence - a phenomenon that remained prevalent well into the 20th century. Regional sensitivities were no longer taken into account but, on the contrary, regional feelings were seen as dangerous tendencies that could destroy Italian efforts at unification."
 manzoni.916.g: "[SCOPE.sState('manzoni_regionalist_state').GetName] is an Italian region like any other."
 manzoni.916.h: "We should take this special heritage into account."
 manzoni.917.t: "Dialects or languages?"
 manzoni.917.d: "The leading teachers, lecturers and professors in our country have spoken out in favor of particularly promoting the implementation of the Italian language not only in public institutions, but also in everyday life. This should significantly improve the scientific and political processes in the new Italy - but among the general population, especially the rural population, it is an extremely unpopular demand, as people there continue to speak exclusively in dialect."
 manzoni.917.f: "Even in the 18th century there was no question that the individual language varieties of the Italian peninsula were independent languages. It wasn't just Tuscan that had great prestige because of Dante Alighieri. Venetian was the official and written language of the Republic of Venice, plays such as those by Carlo Goldoni and literature were written in Venetian, which also still had a special significance as a lingua franca in the Adriatic region. Something similar can be said about Neapolitan. In the 19th century, however, the view prevailed that there was only one standard Italian variety and that all other languages in Italy were mere dialects - even though the Italian spoken in the north already had a special linguistic status. However, in the course of political movements, the reality became more and more prevalent: a language differs from a dialect in that the former has a navy and an army."
 manzoni.917.g: "Our linguistic diversity is our prestige."
 manzoni.917.h: "Speak Italian, speak clear. The rest are merely dialects."
 manzoni.918.t: "The Fate of Foscolo"
 manzoni.918.d: "As national sentiment becomes more and more evident, voices are being raised calling for the body of the great Italian poet Ugo Foscolo to be transported from Great Britain to Italy."
 manzoni.918.f: "The new Italian nation was looking for landmarks: historical events but also historical personalities. The idea of creating a tomb of artists, scientists and other great personalities based on the model of the Parthenon, similar to that in France, arose early on. Santa Croce in Florence, which had previously served as the burial place of prominent citizens, seemed the right place for this. Personalities such as Machiavelli, Michelangelo and Galileo have long been more Italian than Tuscan. Ugo Foscolo, a poet of Venetian origin from the island of Zakynthos, lived in the revolutionary years and is considered a defining figure of early Italian liberalism and nationalism. He would be the perfect addition to this gallery of great Italian minds. However, Foscolo died in exile in 1827 - in Turnham Green near London."

 manzoni.920.d_foscolo: "The British government has agreed - Foscolo's body will soon be back on Italian soil and will find its final resting place in the church of Santa Croce!"
 manzoni.920.f_foscolo: "Ugo Foscolo's return to Italy is considered one of the first key points for the young nation-state. Foscolo was celebrated like a returned hero; his burial was like a procession - with people crying and cheering. With the 'Pantheon' of great Italian personalities in Santa Croce, a fixed point of Italian nationalism was inaugurated that people could orientate themselves towards. The Italian heroes should would be the focus of this ideology, rather than the Catholic saints."

We can therefore move our seat of government there without any disadvantages. If we have a zoo, a museum or an observatory in the old capital, they will be dismantled there, but we will immediately receive a corresponding replacement in the new capital."

 manzoni.921.d: "Italy is considered one of the countries that played a decisive role in the development of musical culture - whether in the field of instrument making, in the development of opera, in the training of famous singers or in terms of great composers. Musically, since the Renaissance at the latest, the peninsula has been characterized by a unique musical culture that has captivated the whole of Europe and provided new impulses. The fact that Italian was the only opera language until the 19th century is evidence of this great heritage."
 manzoni.921.f: "'Give me the laundress' bill and I will set to music even that.' -Gioachino Rossini"
 manzoni.921.g: "Italy has a rich musical history."

 manzoni.922.t: "Dante Cult"
 manzoni.922.d: "Dante Alighieri is considered the ultimate symbol of Italian culture, and his 'Divine Comedy' is considered one of the classics of world literature and the most important literary testimony of the Middle Ages. The worship of Dante has become a true cult among patriots and is at the same time seen as evidence to the outside world that a pan-Italian feeling existed long before the Risorgimento - after all, it was Dante who first defined the borders of Italy as the area in which the language of the 'Sì' would be spoken. A monument is to be erected in Florence that commemorates the 'supreme poet'."
 manzoni.922.f: "'Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\nmi ritrovai per una selva oscura,\nché la diritta via era smarrita.' -Dante Alighieri"

 je_manzoni_italian_greater_national_identity: "Dante's Legacy"
 je_manzoni_italian_greater_national_identity_reason: "Where does Italian identity end? For Dante it was clear: with the language! And even for many patriots, who were far removed from the heartland of Italian culture, it remained clear which were not only the true boundaries, but also the true language. The renegade peoples of the Alps with their crude Latin, and the Corsicans under the yoke of the French with their Tuscan tongue must also become part of the nation - not only politically but also spiritually. Malta is an exception - but a lost Italian people will soon relearn their language, like a child that has been taken away from its mother for too long."

 manzoni.924.t: "Lingua del Sì"
 manzoni.924.d: "After more than 500 years of Dante Alighieri defining Italy's language boundaries, this linguistic community is now a national one. From the Alpine valleys to Malta, from the coasts of Sardinia and Corsica to Istria, there is a single Italian language community that carries on the legacy of the greatest poet."
 manzoni.924.f: "Neapolitan? An Italian dialect. Venetian? An Italian dialect. Corsican? An Italian dialect. Ladin? An Italian dialect. Rumantsh? An Italian dialect. Maltese? Sort of an Italian dialect with Semitic vocabulary."

 manzoni.925.f: "'For some speak affirmatively Oc, others Oil, others Si, namely the Spaniards, French and Latins. But there is a sign that the languages of these three peoples descend from one and the same dialect, because they name many things with the same expressions, for example Deum, Caelum, Amorem, Mare, Terram and Vivit, Moritur, Amat, almost everything else. Of these, those who spoke Oc occupy the western part of southern Europe, beginning from the borders of the Genoese. But those who say Si assume the eastern one of the above-mentioned boundaries, namely as far as that promontory of Italy where the bosom of the Adriatic Sea begins, and as far as Sicily.' -Dante Alighieri"

### Nationalization ###

 je_nationalization_germanization: "Germanization"
 je_nationalization_germanization_reason: "After the founding of the German Empire in 1871, the Germans' sense of unity was already very widespread in the various federal states. The urgent need to unify the German states had existed since 1848. Only in Bavaria did a specific regional feeling prevail until well into the 20th century, but this was increasingly pushed back. Joint wars, a national education system, joint military service and the construction of national institutions such as barracks, military ports and administrative facilities are likely to ensure that a significantly stronger all-German identity emerges from the arduous process of national unity in the next few years."
 je_nationalization_germanization_goal: "#O National Identity Progress#! reaches #G 250#!."

 je_nationalization_german_national_identity: "German Identity"
 je_nationalization_german_national_identity_reason: "After a few years of growing together and a few reforms, the feeling of being connected to a pan-German identity is increasingly spreading among the general population. This feeling will spread from region to region, no matter how the state sets the right framework: regions that are well served by government administrations, universities, barracks or naval bases are more likely to develop an all-German identity due to their integrative function. Heavily urbanized areas are more likely to find access to a concept that was previously only researched by intellectuals. Under perfect circumstances, one sub-state could adopt the new identity every year."

 nationalization.103.d: "With the establishment of the German national state and the enforcement of the pan-German identity, those Germans outside the borders - whether as emigrants in the world or originally living under foreign rule - will also identify themselves primarily as Germans.

 je_nationalization_frenchization: "Frenchization"
 je_nationalization_frenchization_reason: "From 1881 onwards, children who spoke Occitan at school were punished in accordance with minister Jules Ferry's recommendations; this led to a deprecation of the language known as la vergonha (the shaming). This also applied to other parts of France, which had been struggling under centralization efforts since the French Revolution. From the end of the 19th century, the French state increased its efforts to further reduce regional differences in favor of a monolithic identity."

But this is misleading. He is given to every kind of listlessness, but when there is glory to be won he may be inspired with every kind of fury. Give him a pike and he will enact the tenth of August, a musket and you have Austerlitz. He was the springboard of Napoleon and the mainstay of Danton.
