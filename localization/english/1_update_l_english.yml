 je_lepsius_alexander: "The Tomb of Alexander"
 je_lepsius_alexander_reason: "Alexander the Great was one of the most important generals of all time and founded a world empire from which the Hellenistic empires emerged. Both revered and feared, his tomb became a place of pilgrimage in the ancient world. But from the 5th century AD at the latest, the exact location of the tomb was unknown. Most sources speak of Alexandria as the last burial site, but even this is not entirely without controversy. Our primary goal is to carry out an excavation - whether by license or by force - at sites where traces of Alexander have been found. By following clues, we can locate the tomb more precisely. To do this, however, we will have to move from one excavation site to the next like a scavenger hunt."

 je_lepsius_ark: "The Ark of the Covenant"
 je_lepsius_ark_reason: "The Ark of the Covenant is of the highest religious and archaeological value. The people of Israel considered it the center of their sanctuary, the Temple of Jerusalem. Since the times of Moses, as the keeper of the Ten Commandments, it has been a companion in the reconquest of the Holy Land. The Ark was the guarantor of God's presence in the midst of the people. It has been considered lost since the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar II (587/586 BC). Our primary goal is to carry out an excavation - whether by license or by force - at sites where traces of the Ark have been found. By following clues, we can locate the true location more precisely.

 je_lepsius_atlantis: "The Fate of Atlantis"
 je_lepsius_atlantis_reason: "Atlantis is one of the greatest human myths in world history. The fall of the legendary city has become a symbol: it represents the loss of a paradise, the prophecy of a great country in the West and the fall of a highly developed civilization. For the first time, Plato mentions the supposedly powerful sea power that dominated large parts of the Mediterranean until a natural disaster sealed its fate. The possible existence of Atlantis was already discussed in ancient times. While authors such as Pliny the Elder denied that the island kingdom in question existed, others, such as Krantor, Poseidonios and Strabo, considered its existence to be conceivable. Our primary goal is to carry out an excavation - whether by license or by force - at sites where traces of Atlantis have been found. By following clues, we can locate the position of the city more precisely. To do this, however, we will have to move from one excavation site to the next like a scavenger hunt."

 je_lepsius_eldorado_reason: "Were the conquistadors following mere fairy tales and tall tales? Without the stories of legendary gold peoples, Balboa would not have found the Pacific, Hernando de Soto would not have roamed what is now the USA. The discovery of the New World would have been different. The Cortés case and the Pizarro case confirmed the legends. Perhaps there is something to the fact that there is still an undiscovered, important city on the American continent - the archaeological facts speak for themselves. Our primary goal is to carry out an excavation - whether by license or by force - at sites where traces of El Dorado have been found. By following clues, we can locate the city more precisely.

 lepsius_specialization_aegean_button_desc: "Aegean civilization is a general term for the Bronze Age civilizations of Greece around the Aegean Sea. There are three distinct but communicating and interacting geographic regions covered by this term: Crete, the Cyclades and the Greek mainland. Crete is associated with the Minoan civilization from the Early Bronze Age. The Cycladic civilization converges with the mainland during the Early Helladic period and with Crete in the Middle Minoan period. From c. 1450 BC (Late Helladic, Late Minoan), the Greek Mycenaean civilization spreads to Crete, probably by military conquest."

The thesis that the eruption of the volcano was the origin of Plato's story about the sinking of Atlantis is one of the many localization hypotheses about Atlantis.

Because there are other pieces from the Ptolomaic period, some even from the time of the Greek conquest. Pieces of the puzzle that were previously impossible to interpret suddenly make sense. A hint that there could be more lying dormant in the Egyptian desert. Something so big and massive that the entire Sahara isn't enough to bury it. The final resting place of Alexander the Great remains a mystery to this day. But the many finds, the vast amount of knowledge, and the brilliant archaeological expertise of Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_archaeologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] are a mixture that is historically unique.

The creation account shows parallels to the Babylonian myths.

Since that day, the Ark of the Covenant, in which Moses is said to have placed the Ten Commandments, has also disappeared without a trace. It is one of the most important lost artifacts in world history. With an eye on the perfect collection, [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_archaeologist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has found clues that show that the Ark of the Covenant may not have been lost forever - and has been waiting to be recovered for 2,500 years."

Was an archaeologist allowed to dream? Nobody believed Schliemann when he searched for Troy. The Tower of Babel had also been dismissed as a mere metaphor.

 lepsius.1004.f: "Since the arrival of Europeans in America, rumors have been circulating. Deadly rumors. Countless men perished because their greed for gold drove them: into the arms of warring tribes, into malaria-infested swamps and into storms at sea. Ponce de Léon was looking for the fountain of youth. Vázquez de Coronado searched for the Seven Cities of Gold. Hernando de Soto traversed much of North America in search of unknown riches. The hope of becoming famous and wealthy like Cortés and Pizarro was too seductive, although deceptive. But now that [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_archaeologist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] is inspired by the supposed Inca idol and compares it with other artifacts from the rich pre-Columbian exhibition, [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_archaeologist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_archaeologist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerselfHimself] fears that [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_archaeologist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] may succumb to the same gold fever.
