Surely the Gallery will see many more great Painters in the future!"

 je_klimt_rossetti: "Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood"
 je_klimt_rossetti_reason: "The Pre-Raphaelites are a group of artists who see a cultural break in the Renaissance art of Raphael and Michelangelo. They prefer Italian painting from the Trecento and Quattrocento. They saw themselves as a reform movement. Their rivalry was less with the actual Renaissance artists than with the neoclassicists who modeled themselves on them. They particularly took up medieval subjects. One of its most famous representatives was Dante Gabriele Rossetti."
 je_klimt_fattori: "Macchiaioli"
 je_klimt_fattori_reason: "The Macchiaioli were a unique Italian artistic group who anticipated innovations in Impressionism, but remained largely unnoticed in their time. The term Macchiaioli is derived from the Italian word macchia, which means spot (a second meaning is scrub, maquis). Their most important representative was Giovanni Fattori."
 je_klimt_barbizon: "The Barbizon School"
 je_klimt_barbizon_reason: "The Barbizon School was formed by a group of French landscape painters towards the end of the first third of the 19th century. The artists stayed in the village of Barbizon near the Fontainebleau Forest. The painter's colony, which was founded by Théodore Rousseau and existed until around 1870, had a significant influence on landscape painting throughout Europe, especially impressionism."

 klimt.501.t: "The Pre-Raphaelites"
 klimt.501.d: "With the Pre-Raphaelites, a brotherhood was established that opposed classicism and realism, but at the same time saw itself as a reform movement. Their support could bring new talent to light, but that would contradict the style of our current painter, [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]."
 klimt.501.f: "'I have been here before,\nBut when or how I cannot tell:\nI know the grass beyond the door,\nThe sweet, keen smell,\nThe sighing sound, the lights around the shore.' -Dante Gabriele Rossetti"
 klimt.501.g: "Promote the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood."
 klimt.501.h: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] is way better"
 klimt.502.t: "The Macchiaioli"
 klimt.502.d: "The Macchiaioli artist group was founded in Florence today. Although its influence is small, the group inspires some young artists to seek new paths in art."
 klimt.502.f: "'The stain (macchia) is the solidity of bodies in front of the light' -Giovanni Fattori"
 klimt.502.g: "So they were avantgarde before the Avantgarde?"
 klimt.503.t: "Barbizon School"
 klimt.503.d: "With the establishment of a circle of painters near Fontainebleau under the direction of Théodore Rousseau, landscape painting experienced new impulses throughout the art scene."
 klimt.503.f: "'If my painting depicts faithfully and without over-refinement the simple and true character of the place you have frequented, if I succeed... in giving its own life to that world of vegetation, then you will hear the trees moaning under the winter wind, the birds that call their young and cry after their dispersion; you will feel the old chateau tremble; it will tell you that, as the wife you loved, it too will... disappear and be reborn in multiple forms... One does not copy with mathematical precision what one sees, but one feels and interprets a real world, all of whose fatalities hold you fast bound.' -Théodore Rousseau"
 klimt.503.g: "Fine Landscapes!"

 klimt.601.t: "The Death of [SCOPE.sCharacter('klimt_painter_scope').GetLastName]"
 klimt.601.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('klimt_painter_scope').GetFullName], a nationally and internationally highly regarded painter and one of our country's outstanding artistic personalities, died today. He leaves a gap that can hardly be filled."
 klimt.601.f: "On June 26, 1835, Caspar David Friedrich suffered a stroke with symptoms of paralysis. He took a cure in Teplitz, which he could only afford by selling some pictures about the poet Zhukovsky to the Russian tsar's court. After the treatment, Friedrich started painting again, which caused him difficulties. Nevertheless, the oil painting Seaside by Moonlight was created in 1835/36. Until 1839, he mostly produced sepia drawings and watercolors, fewer landscapes and more death allegories. Friedrich sent some sepia drawings to the Dresden art exhibitions in 1836 and 1838. In the last year of my life, work came to a standstill. Friedrich died at the age of 65 on May 7, 1840 in Dresden and was buried in the Trinity Cemetery."
 klimt.601.g: "But who is painting his death portrait now?"
 klimt.602.f: "As Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant. His father's death in 1829 had a profound effect on him, and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression. Turner died of cholera at the home of Sophia Caroline Booth, in Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, on 19 December 1851. He is buried in St Paul's Cathedral, where he lies near the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. Apparently his last words were "The Sun (or Son?) is God", though this may be apocryphal."
 klimt.603.f: "On February 6, 1848, the Cole family attended a morning service at Saint Luke's Episcopal Church in Catskill. After lunch, Cole complained of lassitude and by midnight his condition worsened and the doctor was summoned. An attack of pleurisy and congestion of his lungs followed. Thomas Cole died in the Main House at Cedar Grove at 8 pm on Friday, February 11th, 1848."
 klimt.604.f: "The winter of 1862/63 was extremely rough for Delacroix; he was suffering from a bad throat infection that seemed to get worse over the course of the season. On a trip to Champrosay, he met a friend on the train and became exhausted after having a conversation. On 1 June he returned to Paris to see his doctor. Two weeks later, on 16 June, he was getting better and returned to his house in the country. But by 15 July he was sick enough to again see his doctor, who said he could do nothing more for him. By then, the only food he could eat was fruit. Delacroix realized the seriousness of his condition and wrote his will, leaving a gift for each of his friends. For his trusted housekeeper, Jenny Le Guillou, he left enough money for her to live on while ordering everything in his studio to be sold. He also inserted a clause forbidding any representation of his features, 'whether by a death-mask or by drawing or by photography. I forbid it, expressly.' On 13 August, Delacroix died."
 klimt.605.f: "In the last years of his life, Eckersberg's eyesight began to fail. This eventually led to him having to give up painting altogether. He died in Copenhagen of cholera on July 22, 1853 during the great epidemic. He is buried in Copenhagen's Assistens Cemetery."

 klimt.901.f: "A nation's milestones also have an impact on the country's painters. Extraordinary cultural events, technological advances and scientific discoveries can inspire artists to capture them on canvas for eternity."

 klimt.902.t: "Treasures of the Pacific"
 klimt.902.d: "The return of an expedition from the Pacific has left its mark: exotic goods, fascinating art treasures, new oceanographic knowledge and wild animals have reached [GetPlayer.GetNameNoFlag]. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was inspired by this to create a painting that showcases our nation's will to discover and explore."
 klimt.903.t: "Oriental Art"
 klimt.903.d: "The increasing number of expeditions to the Middle East have awakened a euphoria in society for an art movement that can be described as 'Orientalism'. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was also captured by the fascination of the Orient and painted a fantasy painting from 1001 Nights."
 klimt.904.t: "The Impulse of a New Era"
 klimt.904.d: "[GetPlayer.GetNameNoFlag] is at the forefront of conquering the skies. New machines, whether airplanes or zeppelins, populate the sky.

 klimt.905.t: "Portrait with Tiger and Lion"
 klimt.905.d: "During his last visit to the zoo, [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was able to experience first hand the exotic animals that [GetPlayer.GetNameNoFlag] had already brought to the capital from all over the world. As a qualified zoologist, Prof. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_naturalist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] gave [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim|U] a tour and told him some interesting facts about the animals.

 klimt.907.t: "Secrets of the Jungle"
 klimt.907.d: "The archaeological discoveries in Yucatan and the adventurous circumstances in which researchers like Prof. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lepsius_archaeologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] repeatedly discovered new Mayan sites led [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] to immortalize our expeditions in pictures."
 klimt.908.t: "Portrait of [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('elgar_composer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]"
 klimt.908.d: "The tireless work and the constantly new highlights in Maestro [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('elgar_composer_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName]'s work have inspired [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] to create a portrait of the composer. Not only his unparalleled music, but also this painting will increase his fame."

 klimt.911.t: "A Portrait of the [SCOPE.sCharacter('klimt_ruler_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle]?"
 klimt.911.d: "A portrait of [SCOPE.sCharacter('klimt_ruler_scope').GetFullName] is still missing from the official gallery of [GetPlayer.GetNameNoFlag]'s heads of state. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] is considered an obvious candidate to properly showcase the ruler."
 klimt.911.f: "Every term there is a chance that a painter will be asked to paint a portrait of the head of government or head of state. Whether this succeeds depends on the reputation of the artist in question."
 klimt.911.g: "Create a portrait."
 klimt.911.h: "And if it goes wrong - who will pay for it?"
 klimt.912.t: "A... remarkable Portrait"
 klimt.912.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] publicly unveiled his portrait of the [SCOPE.sCharacter('klimt_ruler_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] today. While fellow artists emphasize the 'audacity' and 'innovation', parts of the government are horrified by it."
 klimt.912.f: "'That's disgusting!'\n'It's called Kubism, Sir.'"
 klimt.912.g: "Art is Art."
 klimt.912.h: "Destroy that painting!"
 klimt.913.t: "A Great Portrait"
 klimt.913.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('klimt_painter_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has outdone himself with his painting of the [SCOPE.sCharacter('klimt_ruler_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle]. The painting immediately aroused enthusiasm and is considered one of his best works."
