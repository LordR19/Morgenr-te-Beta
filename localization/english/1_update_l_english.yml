academics_goettinger_seven_monument_modifer: "Goettinger Seven Monument"

je_goettinger_seven_monument: "Goettinger Seven Monument"
je_goettinger_seven_monument_reason: "A united German nation could honor the memory of the Göttingen Seven - provided that the leading unifying power has already historically stood up for them. A monument would inspire generations of academics! Of course, this assumes that the German government shares the liberal ideas of the legendary professors."

academics.3101.t: "The Constitution of Hanover"
academics.3101.d: "As one of his first official acts, the King announced that he would abolish the constitution, the so-called Staatsgrundgesetz ('Basic Law of the State'). [SCOPE.sCharacter('dacademics_ruler_scope').GetFirstName] has emphasized that he does not feel bound to it."
academics.3101.f: "Hanover had received its first constitution, granted by the Prince Regent, in 1819; this did little more than denote Hanover's change from an electorate to a kingdom, guaranteed by the Congress of Vienna. The Duke of Cambridge, as King William's viceroy in Hanover, recommended a thorough reorganisation of the Hanoverian government. William IV had given his consent to a new constitution in 1833; the Duke of Cumberland's consent was neither asked nor received, and he had formally protested against the constitution's adoption without his consent. Immediately upon his arrival in Hanover, the King dissolved the Hanoverian Parliament, which had been convened under the disputed constitution. He proclaimed the suspension of the constitution, on the grounds that his consent had not been asked and that it did not meet the kingdom's needs."
academics.3101.g: "Suspend the constitution."
academics.3101.h: "The King is not above the law."
academics.3102.t: "The Göttingen Seven"
academics.3102.d: "Historian and politician Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann contested Ernest's plans to change the constitution to his liking, as Dahlmann himself had contributed to the constitution's framing. Six other famous professors from the University of Göttingen joined the protest and defended the constitution of 1833. Soon the men were known as the 'Göttingen Seven' - and were a nuisance to the King."
academics.3102.f: "Dahlmann's document met with an explosive influence—the students at the university produced many hundreds or even thousands of copies and disseminated them across Germany. The other six protesters were the Germanist brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm (famed fairy tale and folk tale writers and storytellers, known together as the Brothers Grimm), jurist Wilhelm Eduard Albrecht, historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus, physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber, and theologian and orientalist Heinrich Georg August Ewald. The protest's impact forced the king to take action, and the seven defiant professors were questioned before the university court."
academics.3102.g: "They should be removed from their positions and be banished!"
academics.3102.h: "Give in to their demands before the situation escalates."
academics.3103.d: "After Queen Victoria's accession to the throne in the United Kingdom, there was some sadness at the loss of the personal union with Hanover that had lasted over 120 years. But after the latest events in Germany, you can confidently say: it's good that we're going our separate ways."
academics.3103.f: "Only a few months after the new King's accession to the throne, Hanover dissolved the constitution that had been issued under British rule. The new King Ernest Augustus now faces a whole opposition from academics. People are already talking about this dispute all over Germany. Truly, as soon as a country leaves the beneficial British sphere of influence it falls into barbarism."
academics.3103.g: "It's so good to be British."
academics.3104.d: "The states of the German Confederation are shaken by the conflict between the King of Hanover and seven recalcitrant professors: after King Ernest Augustus abolished the constitution, the 'Göttingen Seven' rebelled against him. They lost their positions - but have gained plenty of sympathy in the liberal German camp."
academics.3104.f: "Historian and politician Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann contested Ernest's plans to change the constitution to his liking, as Dahlmann himself had contributed to the constitution's framing. Six other famous professors from the University of Göttingen joined the protest and defended the constitution of 1833. The other six protesters were the Germanist brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm (famed fairy tale and folk tale writers and storytellers, known together as the Brothers Grimm), jurist Wilhelm Eduard Albrecht, historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus, physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber, and theologian and orientalist Heinrich Georg August Ewald. The direct effects of the protest were limited, but public sensation and media interest was high in Germany and much of Europe, and the seven were popular among the general public."
academics.3104.g: "With all due respect, the King has gone too far."
academics.3104.h: "This academic rabble has received its just punishment."
academics.3105.t: "A heated debate about Hanover"
academics.3105.d: "The conflict with the 'Göttinger Seven' did not go unnoticed in the other states of the German Confederation. Even in Great Britain people are irritated that the King has repealed the constitution."
academics.3105.f: "[SCOPE.sCountry('academics_anti_hanover_country').GetName] is one of the numerous German states that have criticized Ernest Augustus' actions. But there are still countries, especially those with authoritarian rule, that have shown understanding towards the process. These include [SCOPE.sCountry('academics_pro_hanover_country').GetName]."
academics.3105.g: "That's none of their business!"
academics.3106.t: "Student Propaganda"
academics.3106.d: "Despite all efforts by the state to prevent the spread of propaganda in favor of the 'Göttingen Seven', liberal student circles managed to distribute leaflets on a large scale in large cities."
academics.3106.f: "Remember our heroes! Remember the Göttingen Seven! Praise their virtues!' When Professor Dahlmann published his documents against the King of Hanover, it received popular support by german students and liberals. It had an explosive influence in the states of the German Confederation. The students at the university of Göttingen produced many hundreds, or even thousands, of copies and disseminated them across Germany."
academics.3106.g: "This riotous student pack!"
academics.3107.t: "Jacob Grimm in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag]"
academics.3107.d: "After being banished from Hanover, the famous German scholar and lawyer Jacob Grimm is looking for a new home. Our sympathies for the 'Göttinger Seven' have spread to him, which is why he is hoping for a new job."
academics.3107.f: "Jacob Ludwig Karl Grimm was a German author, linguist, philologist, jurist, and folklorist. He formulated Grimm's law of linguistics, and was the co-author of the Deutsches Wörterbuch, the author of Deutsche Mythologie, and the editor of Grimms' Fairy Tales. He was the older brother of Wilhelm Grimm; together, they were the literary duo known as the Brothers Grimm."
academics.3107.g: "Welcome him."
academics.3107.h: "We don't need another cranky academic."
academics.3108.t: "Wilhelm Eduard Weber in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag]"
academics.3108.d: "After being banished from Hanover, the famous physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber is looking for a new home. Our sympathies for the 'Göttinger Seven' have spread to him, which is why he is hoping for a new job."
academics.3108.f: "Wilhelm Eduard Weber was a German physicist and, together with Carl Friedrich Gauss, inventor of the first electromagnetic telegraph."
academics.3111.t: "Der Grimm"
academics.3111.d: "The brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm have presented the first volume of a German dictionary that is intended to cover the entire German vocabulary. A mammoth task, but one that brings the German cultural nation even closer together."
academics.3111.f: "Das Deutsche Wörterbuch (The German Dictionary) is one of the most important dictionaries of the German language. It is for German what the Oxford English Dictionary is for English, containing detailed historical information about the origin and use over time of German words, with examples taken from actual documents. In German the dictionary is also known as 'Der Grimm'. It was started by the Grimm brothers in 1838. Initially they expected the project to take ten years and produce 6 or 7 volumes. In fact, the first volume was not published until 1854. Wilhelm Grimm died in 1859, and Jacob in 1863, while working on the entry for 'Frucht' (fruit). After their deaths multiple institutions were involved in the work, including the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Berlin Academy, with a center in Göttingen also involved. Finally completed in 1961, the dictionary will contain 32 volumes and include about 350,000 main entries. The 'Grimm' was not only a scientific, but also national work."
academics.3111.g: "This should be published in every German State!"
academics.3112.g: "I hoped they made a new fairy tale book instead of this..."

######GAUDÍ######

gaudi_captain: "Captain"
gaudi_nemo: "Nemo"

gaudi_nautilus_modifier: "Mobilis In Mobili"
gaudi_nautilus_strikes_modifier: "Anti-Imperialist Vengeance"

gaudi_nemo_button: "Hunt the Monster"
gaudi_nemo_button_desc: "A small expedition with an experienced naturalist on board should help us find out more about the danger posed by the unknown monster."

je_gaudi_nemo: "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas"
je_gaudi_nemo_reason: "A mysterious sea monster, which eyewitnesses believe is a giant narwhal, is attacking our commercial shipping and even attacking ports. With the help of a naturalist, we can send out an expedition to learn more about the creature - and possibly stop it."

gaudi.90.t: "Mysterious Whale sinks Ship!"
gaudi.90.d: "There are more and more reports that were initially dismissed as sailor's superstition but can no longer be dismissed. In essence, over a period of time several ships had encountered 'an enormous thing' at sea, a long spindle-shaped object, sometimes giving off a phosphorescent glow, infinitely bigger and faster than any whale.'\n\nSeveral ships of the merchant marine have been lost at sea over the past year to a strange phenomenon, believed by many to be a large and as of yet undiscovered species of whale."
gaudi.90.f: "The facts relating to this apparition agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, a surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the ichthyologists of the day."
gaudi.90.g: "But is it really a whale?"
gaudi.91.t: "Mysterious Whale attacks again!"
gaudi.91.d: "The mysterious monster has struck again! The entire merchant shipping industry is horrified."
gaudi.91.f: "The engineers visited the Scotia, which was put in dry-dock. They could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below water-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle. The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it could not have been more neatly done by a punch. It was clear, then, that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common stamp; and after having been driven with prodigious strength, and piercing an iron plate one and three-eighth inches thick, had withdrawn itself by a retrograde motion truly inexplicable."
gaudi.91.g: "This nefarious threat to the peace on the high seas must end!"
gaudi.92.t: "Mysterious Whale attacks coast!"
gaudi.92.d: "The whale - or whatever - has attacked a port city and left a path of destruction in its wake."
gaudi.92.f: "The hypothesis of the floating island, and the unapproachable sand-bank, supported by minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned. And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity? From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck was given up.\n\nThere remained then only two possible solutions of the question, which created two distinct parties; on one side, those who were for a monster of colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a submarine vessel of enormous motive power."
gaudi.93.t: "The Professor and his Monster"
gaudi.93.d: "After [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetFullName] inquired about the last crime scene of the unknown creature, he set out with a brave team to search for the monster."
gaudi.93.f: "'The great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us. Soundings cannot reach them. What passes in those remote depths—what beings live, or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the waters—what is the organization of these animals—we can scarcely conjecture. However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may modify the form of the dilemma. Either we do know all the varieties of beings which people our planet, or we do not. If we do not know them all, if Nature has still secrets in ichthyology for us, nothing is more conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or cetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organization formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an accident of some sort, either fantastical or capricious, has brought at long intervals to the upper level of the ocean.'"
gaudi.93.g: "Good luck!"
gaudi.94.t: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] is missing!"
gaudi.94.d: "The sea monster attacked the ship that wanted to investigate it. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetFullName] fell overboard in the fight with the monster! Despite searching for days, they couldn't find him."
gaudi.94.f: "'At this moment, leaning on the forecastle bulwark, I saw below me Ned Land grappling the martingale in one hand, brandishing his terrible harpoon in the other, scarcely twenty feet from the motionless animal. Suddenly his arm straightened, and the harpoon was thrown; I heard the sonorous stroke of the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard body. The electric light went out suddenly, and two enormous waterspouts broke over the bridge of the frigate, rushing like a torrent from stem to stern, over-throwing men, and breaking the lashing of the spars. A fearful shock followed, and, thrown over the rail without having time to stop myself, I fell into the sea.'"
gaudi.94.g: "No! Not Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName]!"
gaudi.95.t: "Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] washes ashore!"
gaudi.95.d: "The renowned naturalist [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetFullName] was found washed up on our shores today. The professor has been gone for quite some time since joining an expedition sent out to discover the truth behind a mysterious whale said to sink and devour ships on the high seas. The professor is shocked by the profound experience he has had, and his story is indeed remarkable. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] claims that he was washed overboard during a close encounter between his ship and the creature, and that the creature is in fact a human ship, capable of under water travel. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] maintains that the ship is, or was, commanded by a freedom-loving vigilante who has sworn off all contact with terra firma in favor of a free life on the world's oceans aboard his ship. Whatever the truth, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName]'s many detailed accounts of many strange new life forms - supposedly encountered during his voyage as a guest aboard this strange vessel - will be a boon for our scientific efforts for years to come."
gaudi.95.f: "'It is evidently a gigantic narwhal, and an electric one.' -[SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_nemo_scope').GetFullName]"
gaudi.95.g: "But is Captain Nemo really defeated?"
