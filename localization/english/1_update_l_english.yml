 agassiz_seismology_tech_desc: "In response to a series of earthquakes near Comrie in Scotland in 1839, a committee was formed in the United Kingdom in order to produce better detection methods for earthquakes. The outcome of this was the production of one of the first modern seismometers by James David Forbes. From 1857, Robert Mallet laid the foundation of modern instrumental seismology and carried out seismological experiments using explosives. He is also responsible for coining the word 'seismology'."

 je_agassiz_geological_research: "Geological Research"
 je_agassiz_geological_research_reason: "A geologist who can devote himself entirely to his geological studies is primarily interested in minerals. If the geologist has the Mineralogist trait, the country will receive twice the number of minerals it normally receives each year. If this is not the case, then the geologist will receive the mineralogist trait at the end of his five-year research period. Geologists can find access to formations, caves or uranium during these five years. If no state has such special features, other geological events can also occur."
 je_agassiz_geological_research_goal: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] can spend five years undisturbed with extremely boring rock formations."

 agassiz.401.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has summarized all of [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] previous experiences and knowledge throughout [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] life to provide a new estimate of the age of the Earth. The question remains whether the theory is also recognized by the scientific community."
 agassiz.401.f: "From the beginning of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, the determination of the age of the earth remained vague and was, for the most part, subject to repeated debates and hostility. The question of the age of the earth was often related to the question of evolution, because this needed a sufficiently long period of time to function as a theory. Until the turn of the century, many scientists believed that the Earth was only a few million years old - at the end of his life, Lord Kelvin only assumed it was 20 million years old. But even Charles Darwin, who was one of the 'maximalists' who defended his thesis, believed in around 300 million years. It was not until the discovery of radioactivity that the age of the Earth could be correctly determined and the true extent of the age of the Earth (and therefore of the entire solar system) became known."

 agassiz.313.f: "A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is usually crystalline and formed by geological processes. The majority of the approximately 6,000 mineral species known today and recognized as independent are inorganic, but some organic substances such as mellite and evenkite or the kidney stone formers whewellite and weddellite are also recognized as minerals because geological processes were also involved in their formation. Including all known mineral varieties and synonymous names as well as mineral species that are not yet recognized, there are over 7,000 mineral names."

 agassiz.11.t: "The Dynamics of Earthquakes"
 agassiz.11.d: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has attracted international attention today because [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] has revolutionized previous knowledge of this aspect of geology with a book about earthquakes. Words [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] coined such as 'epicenter' and 'seismology' have already found their way into science."
 agassiz.11.f: "On February 9, 1846, Robert Mallet presented his work 'The Dynamics of Earthquakes' to the Royal Irish Academy, which is considered one of the foundations of modern seismology. Between 1852 and 1858, with the help of his son John William Mallet, he prepared the British Association's Earthquake Catalog, which appeared in 1858 and listed the known earthquakes and described their effects. During this time he also carried out explosion experiments to determine the travel time of seismic waves in loose and solid rock."
