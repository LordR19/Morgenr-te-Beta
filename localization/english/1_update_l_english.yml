The macromolecules of the coal are broken down into smaller molecules by hydrogen at high pressures and temperatures. Gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons are created as products and are used as fuels and lubricants. Between 1910 and 1925, the German chemist Friedrich Bergius developed the basics of the process.

 mendelejew.601.d: "The preparations for the most important international meeting of chemists in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] are almost complete. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] took particular care to ensure that the event attracted the most important experts. Now all that's missing are the invitations."
 mendelejew.601.f: "Chemistry was established as a scientific discipline in the middle of the 19th century and still had a significant theoretical deficit. Different “schools” represented different views, particularly on questions of atomic and molecular construction. According to John Dalton, they were generally accepted as the smallest building blocks of chemical compounds, but next to nothing was known about their structure. Different views were also held on other fundamental theoretical questions such as the base size of atomic weights. The nomenclature and formula writing were also highly inconsistent. However, there was still no forum in which the current problems could be discussed. That's why three young professors of chemistry took the initiative to organize a congress in order to clarify the controversial questions in a discussion with colleagues in the field and invited the most important representatives of the subject to Karlsruhe for September 3rd to 5th, 1860."
 mendelejew.601.g: "Our guests will be the sodium chloride in the soup."
 mendelejew.602.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('mendelejew_congress_host_country').GetName] has invited to an international Chemist Congress. Apparently people want to debate an internationally set weight of atoms. Dr. [SCOPE.sCharacter('mendelejew_chemist_scope').GetLastName] has received a warm invitation."
 mendelejew.602.g: "We have to react quickly!"
 mendelejew.604.t: "The Weight of an Atom"
 mendelejew.604.d: "Although the conference began promisingly, the effort to finally establish the weight of atoms internationally soon stalled. A faction of national-minded chemists did not want to give up their previous systems."
 mendelejew.604.f: "There was no agreement on several topics at the Karlsruhe Congress of 1860. One of the most important topics was atomic and molecular weights. Based on the findings of previous chemists, there was agreement that atoms are discrete particles and molecules are built from them, but several systems of atomic weights were used side by side. One was based on hydrogen, which was assigned the value 1 as the base unit, carbon was assigned 6 and oxygen was assigned 8. As long as there were uncertainties about the atomic weights, the elemental composition of the compounds examined was doubtful. There were up to five different weighting options, and because of the complicated conversions, some chemists were inclined not to change anything at all."
 mendelejew.604.g: "There is no reason to abandon the old system when there is so much disagreement."
 mendelejew.604.h: "We need a common, international atomic weight."
 mendelejew.605.t: "Chemist Conversations"
 mendelejew.605.d: "On the sidelines of the science conference, Dr. [SCOPE.sCharacter('mendelejew_chemist_scope').GetLastName] has the opportunity to exchange ideas with many professional colleagues from all over the world. The question remains how best to take advantage of this unique opportunity."
 mendelejew.605.f: "'There is, indeed, nothing surprising in this necessity for a hypothesis to assist us in the comprehension of laws. It often happens that the mind of a person who is learning a new science, has to pass through all the phases which the science itself has exhibited in its historic evolution.' -Stanislao Canizzaro"
 mendelejew.605.g: "Our chemist is supposed to collect new insights for the future."
 mendelejew.605.h: "Our chemist should look for solutions to current problems in his research."
 mendelejew.605.i: "Our chemist should send his assistants ahead so that they can learn something."
 mendelejew.609.t_national: "Chemistry Congress ends inconclusively"
 mendelejew.609.d_national: "For three days, organizers and leading experts in the field of chemistry tried to save the event, but ultimately no universal rule could be found as to how atomic weight should be reported. The nation states will be stuck with the traditional systems for some time, which makes conversion tables necessary."
 mendelejew.609.f_national: "The Karlsruhe Congress was the first specialist congress of a scientific discipline. Even though there were no decisive results, the Karlsruhe Chemists' Congress can be considered the most important event in the history of chemistry in the 19th century. The meeting of so many chemists from home and abroad had a catalytic effect on the further development of theoretical chemistry."
 mendelejew.609.g: "This will set us back years."
 mendelejew.609.t_international: "Chemistry Congress ends with Agreement"
 mendelejew.609.d_international: "Fortunately, the chemists at the science congress found a uniform solution for atomic weight. It is now internationally recognized. The scientists refer to a theorem from Amedeo Avogadro. Dr. [SCOPE.sCharacter('mendelejew_chemist_scope').GetLastName] happily announced the success in a letter today."
 mendelejew.609.f_international: "An important long-term result of the Karlsruhe Congress was the adoption of the now-familiar atomic weights. Following the Karlsruhe meeting, values of about 1 for hydrogen, 12 for carbon, 16 for oxygen, and so forth were adopted. This was based on a recognition that certain elements, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, were composed of diatomic molecules and not individual atoms. "
 mendelejew.609.h: "A breakthrough for chemistry!"

It was here, on a cold winter's day, that a celestial event of unprecedented magnitude unfolded, forever linking this peaceful settlement with the vast, mysterious universe beyond. The year was 1868. On January 30th, the residents of Pułtusk went about their daily routines, unaware that their lives were about to intersect with an extraordinary phenomenon. As the afternoon gave way to the evening, an unusual silence fell over the town. Without warning, a brilliant light pierced the sky. A fireball, more radiant than the sun, blazed across the heavens. Witnesses described it as a blazing orb, trailing a luminous tail, splitting the sky with a thunderous roar. The fireball, later identified as a meteorite, fragmented explosively as it entered Earth's atmosphere. Thousands of pieces rained down over Pułtusk and its surrounding areas, creating a shower of meteoritic stones. This event became known as the Pułtusk meteorite shower."
