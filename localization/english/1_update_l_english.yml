 je_dufour_carte_dufour_reason: "Since 1822 land surveying is a matter for the Swiss Confederation and not the Cantons. General Dufour was commissioned to carry out the survey of Switzerland according to uniform standards and to record the survey results on a map.

Dufour and his team worked on the map from 1832 until 1865. The first two sheets were published in 1845 and the last of the 25 sheets was published in 1865. The topographic map was printed using a engraving print process and showed a scale of 1:100,000. Interestingly Dufour was the first general of modern Switzerland and lead the Swiss army against the Sonderbund in the Swiss civil war (Sonderbundskrieg) in 1848.\n\n#b Today #! the Carte Dufour is located at the Schweizer Landesmuseum in Zürich.

 dufour.902.t: "Surveyor killed in the Mountains"
 dufour.902.d: "While they were surveying from one of the tall mountains of [SCOPE.sState('dufour_mapping_scope').GetName], our surveyors were surprised by a thunderstorm. It stormed and poured with rain. The surveyors sought shelter in their tent but a lightning strike killed one of them and injured the other."

 dufour.910.t: "First Sheets published: Jura and Basel"
 dufour.910.d: "The first few sheets of our new topographic map were published they are focusing on the area around Basel and the Jura."
 dufour.910.f: "The Jura is a range of small mountains that stretches from Savoy all the way to Basel and some Foothills even to Lake Constance. It encompases parts of Vaud, Neuchâtel, Bern, both Basel, Solothurn and Aaargau. many big cities are close to the Jura.\n Basel for example is one of the most important cities of Switzerland. Basel borders both the Alsace as well as Baden and is well connected thanks to the Rhine River.\nJust a few years ago the Canton of Basel was divided into the Cantons of Basel Stadt (City) and Basel Land (Countryside). Interestingly the countryside was more liberal during that time, while the city was ruled by Patricians. Basel is a quite international and has an old University that harbored great thinkers like Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli.\nGeneva on the other hand is a big city surrounded by France. during Napoléon's reign it was part of France and returned to Switzerland in 1815. Now the first private banks get founded and Geneva slowly becomes a hub of the financial sector. Additionally it was home to Voltaire and Jean-Jaques Rousseau, two of Switzerland's greatest philosophers."
 dufour.910.g: "Interesting!"

 dufour.911.t: "New Sheets published: Schaffhausen, Thurgau and St. Gallen"
 dufour.911.d: "More sheets were published. This time the focus lies on north and eastern Switzerland with the Cantons of Schaffhausen, Thurgau and St. Gallen."
 dufour.911.f: "Schaffhausen lies in the Northeast of Switzerland and is mostly surrounded by Germany. The city itself is located right nex to the Rhine and very close to the Rhinefalls at Neuhausen. Thanks to the energy of the river, Schaffhausen was able to industrialize quite early and thanks to the rural people it become a liberal Canton in 1831.\nThurgau was ruled by another Canton that changed every year until the French Revolution spread to Switzerland. It is a full Canton since 1815 and a center of textile industries and agriculture. The high amount of pear trees lead to the name \"Mostindien\" meaning Cider India which is a play on Ost (east) and Most (Cider). Thurgau is one of the liberal Cantons since 1831 and wants more centralization in Switzerland.\nSt. Gallen is a split Canton in regards to religion and was once the seat of monastery and a Prince Bishopric. It is a center of the textile industry and a liberal Canton. The Canton of St. Gallen surrounds both Appenzell Cantons and the remarkable Säntis mountain range, a part of the Alps."

Corsica belonged to Genoa, Malta to Sicily and Dalmatia and the Ionian Islands were part of the Republic of Venice. Italian communities still exist in these areas. After the glorious unification of Italy and the great progress we have made, it is time to redeem the last italian territories, which are still under foreign rule. A last time we should cry: Va fuori, stranier'!"

Even if the saying is historically questionable, it still brings to the point the truth that after Italy's political unification, internal unity was anything but stable. This doesn't just apply to the south, where the brigands were up to mischief - even in the north, outside of the bourgeois elite, most people still felt connected to their regional identity. Joint wars, a national education system, joint military service and the construction of national institutions such as barracks, military ports and administrative facilities are likely to ensure that a significantly stronger all-Italian identity emerges from the arduous process of national unity in the next few years."

 je_manzoni_italian_national_identity: "Italian Identity"
 je_manzoni_italian_national_identity_reason: "After a few years of growing together and a few reforms, the feeling of being connected to a pan-Italian identity is increasingly spreading among the general population. This feeling will spread from region to region, no matter how the state sets the right framework: regions that are well served by government administrations, universities, barracks or naval bases are more likely to develop an all-Italian identity due to their integrative function. Heavily urbanized areas are more likely to find access to a concept that was previously only researched by intellectuals. Under perfect circumstances, one sub-state could adopt the new identity every year. If all Italians in the nation state feel like they are, this will also have an influence on the Italians abroad, who will then increasingly feel like our countrymen abroad rather than as Lombards, Sicilians or Tuscans."

 manzoni.911.d: "After years of social and political influence, the population in [SCOPE.sState('united_italian_culture_state').GetName] has developed a sense of belonging with the entire Italian peninsula. They are now fully committed to the pan-Italian identity."
 manzoni.911.f: "'The Italians wanted to create a new Italy, and to remain the old Italians of before, with the apprehensions and moral miseries that were their heritage from ancient times; because they think about reforming Italy, and no one realizes that to achieve this they must first reform themselves. -Massimo d'Azeglio"

 manzoni.912.t: "A Pan-Italian Consciousness"
 manzoni.912.d: "Now that the entire population of Italy no longer sees itself primarily as belonging to its regional identity but to its national identity, this has an impact not only on Italians at home but also across the world."
 manzoni.912.f: "With the establishment of the Italian national state and the enforcement of the pan-Italian identity, those Italians outside the borders - whether as emigrants in the world or originally living under foreign rule - will also identify themselves primarily as Italians."
 manzoni.912.g: "We've made the Italians!"
 manzoni_pan_italian_identity_tt: "Worldwide, all northern Italian and southern Italian populations will now identify themselves as a pan-Italian population. Northern Italian and Southern Italian homelands will only be Italian homelands worldwide."
 manzoni.913.d: "Now that the entire population of Italy no longer sees itself primarily as belonging to its regional identity but to its national identity, this has an impact not only on Italians at home but also across the world. In our country, too, there is now an urge to identify as Italian, instead of just referring to regional origins, as was previously the case."

 manzoni.914.f: "Even before the unification of Italy, the intellectual elite in particular had mostly identified themselves as Italian and viewed regional origins only as folklore. From the moment of unification, this awareness spread particularly in the Italian military - the army and the navy became the 'school of the nation'. In politics, the centralist forces prevailed over the regionalist forces early on."
 manzoni.914.g: "The days of campanilismo are over."
 manzoni.915.t: "Brigands in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_brigant_state').GetName]"
 manzoni.915.d: "The poor conditions in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_brigant_state').GetName] have led to more and more people with no prospects joining the [SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_brigant_character').GetFullName] gang. They are now wreaking havoc in the surrounding area - to such an extent that the brigands have become a real problem. There are even supporters among the common people who see them as opponents of the government and increasing Italianization, and therefore as political and regional resisters."
 manzoni.915.f: "Brigandage in Southern Italy had existed in some form since ancient times. However its origins as outlaws targeting random travellers would evolve vastly later on in the form of the political resistance movement. After the conquest of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies in 1861 by the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia (later Kingdom of Italy), the most famous and well known form of brigandage in the area emerged. Amongst the brigands were a mixture of people, with different working backgrounds and motives; the brigands included former prisoners, bandits and other people who the Italian government regarded as common criminals, but also former soldiers and loyalists of the Bourbon army. They launched attacks not only against the Italian authorities and the land owning upper-classes, but also against common people, frequently looting villages, towns and farms, and committing armed robberies against both individuals and groups, including farmers, townspeople and rival brigand bands."
 manzoni.915.g: "Another bandit masquerading as Robin Hood!"
 manzoni.916.t: "Fear for regional heritage"
 manzoni.916.d: "Ordinary people in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_regionalist_state').GetName] fear that the new national Italian institutions and the popularization of the Italian language could destroy the traditional way of life there. [SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_rural_leader_scope').GetFullName] has argued that the region's special heritage should not be ignored and that the homogenization of Italy has already progressed too far."
 manzoni.916.f: "With the failed revolution of 1848/1849, the Neo-Guelphs, as the leading arm of the Italian unity movement, became de facto powerless. They had originally spoken out in favor of a federally structured Italy under the primus inter pares presidency of the Pope. In response, centralist circles gained absolute preeminence - a phenomenon that remained prevalent well into the 20th century. Regional sensitivities were no longer taken into account but, on the contrary, regional feelings were seen as dangerous tendencies that could destroy Italian efforts at unification."
 manzoni.916.g: "[SCOPE.sState('manzoni_regionalist_state').GetName] is an Italian region like any other."
 manzoni.916.h: "We should take this special heritage into account."
 manzoni.917.t: "Dialects or languages?"
 manzoni.917.d: "The leading teachers, lecturers and professors in our country have spoken out in favor of particularly promoting the implementation of the Italian language not only in public institutions, but also in everyday life. This should significantly improve the scientific and political processes in the new Italy - but among the general population, especially the rural population, it is an extremely unpopular demand, as people there continue to speak exclusively in dialect."
 manzoni.917.f: "Even in the 18th century there was no question that the individual language varieties of the Italian peninsula were independent languages. It wasn't just Tuscan that had great prestige because of Dante Alighieri. Venetian was the official and written language of the Republic of Venice, plays such as those by Carlo Goldoni and literature were written in Venetian, which also still had a special significance as a lingua franca in the Adriatic region. Something similar can be said about Neapolitan. In the 19th century, however, the view prevailed that there was only one standard Italian variety and that all other languages in Italy were mere dialects - even though the Italian spoken in the north already had a special linguistic status. However, in the course of political movements, the reality became more and more prevalent: a language differs from a dialect in that the former has a navy and an army."
 manzoni.917.g: "Our linguistic diversity is our prestige."
 manzoni.917.h: "Speak Italian, speak clear. The rest are merely dialects."
 manzoni.918.t: "The Fate of Foscolo"
 manzoni.918.d: "As national sentiment becomes more and more evident, voices are being raised calling for the body of the great Italian poet Ugo Foscolo to be transported from Great Britain to Italy."
 manzoni.918.f: "The new Italian nation was looking for landmarks: historical events but also historical personalities. The idea of creating a tomb of artists, scientists and other great personalities based on the model of the Parthenon, similar to that in France, arose early on. Santa Croce in Florence, which had previously served as the burial place of prominent citizens, seemed the right place for this. Personalities such as Machiavelli, Michelangelo and Galileo have long been more Italian than Tuscan. Ugo Foscolo, a poet of Venetian origin from the island of Zakynthos, lived in the revolutionary years and is considered a defining figure of early Italian liberalism and nationalism. He would be the perfect addition to this gallery of great Italian minds. However, Foscolo died in exile in 1827 - in Turnham Green near London."
 manzoni.918.g: "Ask them to give us Foscolo."
 manzoni.918.h: "We would be embarrassed if they said no."
 manzoni.919.d: "The Italian government has requested that the body of the famous poet and champion of Italian nationalism, Ugo Foscolo, be handed over to them."
 manzoni.919.g: "They should have their petty little poet. What was his name again?"
 manzoni.919.h: "The Fosco-guy stays here."
 manzoni.920.t_foscolo: "Foscolo returns"
 manzoni.920.d_foscolo: "The British government has agreed - Foscolo's body will soon be back on Italian soil and will find its final resting place in the church of Santa Croce!"
 manzoni.920.f_foscolo: "Ugo Foscolo's return to Italy is considered one of the first key points for the young nation-state. Foscolo was celebrated like a returned hero; his burial was like a procession - with people crying and cheering. With the 'Pantheon' of great Italian personalities in Santa Croce, a fixed point of Italian nationalism was inaugurated that people could orientate themselves towards. The Italian heroes should would be the focus of this ideology, rather than the Catholic saints."
 manzoni.920.g: "A great Italian returns home!"
 manzoni.920.t_no_foscolo: "Foscolo remains in exile"
 manzoni.920.d_no_foscolo: "Unfortunately, the British government has prevented Ugo Foscolo from returning to Italy - using several hypocritical excuses."

Musically, since the Renaissance at the latest, the peninsula has been characterized by a unique musical culture that has captivated the whole of Europe and provided new impulses. The fact that Italian was the only opera language until the 19th century is evidence of this great heritage."

 manzoni.922.d: "Dante Alighieri is considered the ultimate symbol of Italian culture, and his 'Divine Comedy' is considered one of the classics of world literature and the most important literary testimony of the Middle Ages. The worship of Dante has become a true cult among patriots and is at the same time seen as evidence to the outside world that a pan-Italian feeling existed long before the Risorgimento - after all, it was Dante who first defined the borders of Italy as the area in which the language of the 'Sì' would be spoken. A monument is to be erected in Florence that commemorates the 'supreme poet'."
 manzoni.922.f: "'Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\nmi ritrovai per una selva oscura,\nché la diritta via era smarrita.' -Dante Alighieri"

 je_manzoni_italian_greater_national_identity_reason: "Where does Italian identity end? For Dante it was clear: with the language! And even for many patriots, who were far removed from the heartland of Italian culture, it remained clear which were not only the true boundaries, but also the true language. The renegade peoples of the Alps with their crude Latin, and the Corsicans under the yoke of the French with their Tuscan tongue must also become part of the nation - not only politically but also spiritually. Malta is an exception - but a lost Italian people will soon relearn their language, like a child that has been taken away from its mother for too long."

 manzoni.924.t: "Lingua del Sì"
 manzoni.924.d: "After more than 500 years of Dante Alighieri defining Italy's language boundaries, this linguistic community is now a national one. From the Alpine valleys to Malta, from the coasts of Sardinia and Corsica to Istria, there is a single Italian language community that carries on the legacy of the greatest poet."
 manzoni.924.f: "Neapolitan? An Italian dialect. Venetian? An Italian dialect. Corsican? An Italian dialect. Ladin? An Italian dialect. Rumantsh? An Italian dialect. Maltese? Sort of an Italian dialect with Semitic vocabulary."
