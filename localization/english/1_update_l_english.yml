 panum.122.f: "The doctor estimates this period to be about half a day to five days, with the average being three days. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has held several discussions with victims of the disease and their relatives. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe|U] was therefore able to reconstruct the events based on several eyewitness reports. Even if the cause remains obscure, conclusions may later be drawn from this observations as to what exactly happened on day 1."
 panum.122.g: "Well observed."
 panum.124.g: "Precisely observed."
 panum.123.t: "Cholera Symptoms"
 panum.123.d: "Today Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] sent to the Medical Faculty a comprehensive list of cholera symptoms."
 panum.123.f: "As is already known, but so far only rudimentarily processed, cholera is a disease of the human small intestine. The consequences are extreme diarrhea with a typical blue-colored 'rice water stool' and severe vomiting. Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was said to have a certain sadistic streak because [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] sent a full description of these and other extremely unsavory symptoms in time for the academic dinner."
 panum.124.t: "Cholera Asiatica"
 panum.124.d: "In a highly acclaimed report, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] worked out the differences between cholera and other cholera-like diseases, which is considered a milestone in future disease description."
 panum.124.f: "The name cholera, which is derived from the Greek word for bile, originally referred to all possible forms of diarrhea or intestinal problems ('bile flow'). Although Jakob de Bondt had already described a specifically Indian cholera disease in 1642, cholera remained purely a collective term. It was only with the emergence of the major cholera pandemics of the 19th century that this specific, new type of cholera, which turned out to be the most devastating disease of the century, was also defined with a proper name to clearly differentiate it: Cholera Asiatica."

 panum.222.t: "Tuberculosis Incubation"
 panum.222.d: "In his research on tuberculosis, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] noticed some oddities related to the disease. Apparently it can take weeks before a sick person actually shows typical symptoms."
 panum.222.f: "Whether miasma theory or germ theory: tuberculosis still poses a mystery. If it is an infectious disease, it can apparently take weeks for the symptoms to break out: the doctor assumes between two and even twelve weeks! In addition, not everyone who lives with someone who is sick seems to become infected directly, as [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] found out in numerous surveys of patients and relatives. Either the academics are right with their theory that tuberculosis is not an infectious disease and other factors are responsible, or the risk of infection is lower than first thought."
 panum.223.t: "Tuberculosis Symptoms"
 panum.223.d: "After Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] intensively studied the symptoms of tuberculosis, [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] came to a conclusion that surprised even some academic colleagues: tuberculosis is a much more complicated disease with a wide variety of symptoms that go far beyond lung problems."
 panum.223.f: "Although the attack on the lungs and their painful, slow destruction is one of the best-known features of tuberculosis, coughing is only one of many symptoms. Pulmonary tuberculosis is just one type of tuberculosis, which can also affect other organs. Fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, night sweats or spitting blood were previously known symptoms. The fact that tuberculosis not only attacks the body outside the lungs, but that two different types of tuberculosis can occur at the same time, has significantly changed the worldview of some members of the Medical Faculty."
 panum.224.t: "Tuberculosis and Scrofula"
 panum.224.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] dealt intensively with the various forms of possible tuberculosis diseases and, despite the numerous similarities with other disease symptoms, worked out the specific differences between tuberculosis and scrofula, but at the same time also emphasized the connections."
 panum.224.f: "Descriptions of tuberculosis have existed for centuries, but it did not have comparable, devastating effects until the 19th century due to less urbanization. It was still known under other names well into the 19th century - the term 'consumption' was still used in the English-speaking world until the 20th century. René Laennec is considered one of the pioneers of tuberculosis research who invented the stethoscope for lung examination. Johann Lukas Schönlein coined the term tuberculosis in 1832 and associated it with a specific clinical picture. An important finding of these years was that scrofula and tuberculosis were two different diseases, but they could hardly be differentiated due to the large number of tuberculosis symptoms."

 panum.322.t: "Smallpox Incubation and Symptoms"
 panum.322.d: "In a recent summary, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] noted that the initial symptoms of smallpox are not unlike those of influenza before the infamous pustules appear. It can be assumed that one to two weeks pass between infection and symptoms."
 panum.322.f: "'Those easily restored to health from the plague seem to me to have been previously dried and purged in respect to the whole body, for vomiting occurred in some of them and the stomach was disturbed in all. And, in the same way, in those already purged who were going to be saved, dark pustules appear clearly over the whole body, in most ulcerous, in all dry. (...) On the outside the body was not hot to the touch, nor was there pallor; the skin was rather red, livid, and broke out into small blisters and ulcers.' -Galen"
 panum.323.t: "Chickenpox or Smallpox?"
 panum.323.d: "During [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] observation of smallpox patients, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was able to present a partial report that chickenpox is an independent, harmless disease. This has been a very controversial theory so far."
 panum.323.f: "'Chickenpox breaks out on many without any illness or previous sign: in others they are preceded by a little degree of chillness, lassitude, cough, broken sleep, wandering pains, loss of appetite and feverishness for three days. Most of them are of the common size of the smallpox but some are less. I never saw them confluent nor very numerous. The greatest number which I ever observed was about twelve in the face, and two hundred over the rest of the body. On the second or at the farthest on the third day from the beginning of the eruption as many of the pocks as are not broken seem arrived at their full maturity, and those which are fullest of that yellow liquor very much resemble what the genuine smallpox are on the fifth or sixth day especially where there happens to be a larger space than ordinary occupied by the extravasated serum.' -William Heberden"
 panum.324.t: "The Difference between Measles and Smallpox"
 panum.324.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] compared the symptoms of smallpox sufferers, measles sufferers and chicken pox sufferers with extreme care and was able to classify them very precisely."
 panum.324.f: "'The eruption of smallpox is preceded by a continued fever, pain in the back, itching in the nose and nightmares during sleep. These are the more acute symptoms of its approach together with a noticeable pain in the back accompanied by fever and an itching felt by the patient all over his body. A swelling of the face appears, which comes and goes, and one notices an overall inflammatory color noticeable as a strong redness on both cheeks and around both eyes. One experiences a heaviness of the whole body and great restlessness, which expresses itself as a lot of stretching and yawning. There is a pain in the throat and chest and one finds it difficult to breathe and cough. Additional symptoms are: dryness of breath, thick spittle, hoarseness of the voice, pain and heaviness of the head, restlessness, nausea and anxiety. Note the difference: restlessness, nausea and anxiety occur more frequently with measles than with smallpox. At the other hand, pain in the back is more apparent with smallpox than with measles.' -Rhazes"

 panum.422.t: "Typhus Symptoms & Incubation"
 panum.422.d: "In a first interim report, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] listed the symptoms of typhus, as well as an initial estimate of when they first appear in the course of the disease."
 panum.422.f: "'Fever, chills, headache, cough, rash, vomiting - all these are signs of typhus. However, all these symptoms can be found in similar diseases, too. Nausea and confusion on the other hand are typical for classic typhus. The characteristic course of the fever is a two to three day rise in temperature, followed by a continuous fever of around ten days and subsequent defervescence over several days. According to my calculations, it takes around ten to fourteen days between infection and the first symptoms.'"
 panum.423.t: "The Camp Fever"
 panum.423.d: "After Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] compares historical reports of epidemics in the military with the current symptoms of typhus sufferers, he comes to the conclusion that equating typhus and 'camp fever' is of little help."
 panum.423.f: "'It is certainly a camp fever - but is it THE camp fever?' Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] asked questions like these that got the members of the Medical Faculty thinking. Historically known as 'camp fever', it has long been associated with epidemics in the major armies or barracks, particularly as the disease that inflicted massive casualties on the Napoleonic Army. But not all illnesses in the army known as 'camp fever' can be equated with typhus. Relapsing fever and trench fever are other diseases known to have affected military personnel in confined spaces. The illness that particularly raged during the American Civil War, on the other hand, is often referred to as typhus, but was actually typhoid fever."
 panum.424.t: "Typhus: Two Diseases in one?"
 panum.424.d: "While examining typhus patients, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] discovered that a number of assumptions were fundamentally wrong. If previous doctors had diagnosed a 'morbid change' in the intestines, [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] could not detect any of this in those who died of typhus. Rather, the doctor assumes that the intestinal disease is an illness that must be distinguished from typhus, which [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] calls 'typhoid fever'."
 panum.424.f: "Until the middle of the 19th century, doctors did not differentiate between typhus and typhoid fever. They were simply considered to be manifestations of the same disease with varying degrees of symptoms. In 1836, the American physician William Gerhard observed that in some typhus sufferers the intestines were not affected by the disease, even though it had been one of the commonly diagnosed symptoms up to that point. Further, similar observations led him to believe that typhus was not a disease of the intestines, but rather attacked other organs: mental confusion and muscle pain were much more common than problems of the digestive tract. The centuries-long identification of typhus and typhoid fever has not only led to a similarity in names, but has also led to the fact that in some languages typhoid fever is referred to as typhus, for example in German."

 panum.522.t: "Two Courses of Yellow Fever"
 panum.522.d: "In [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] close observation of yellow fever, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] made the discovery that the disease can progress in two ways."
 panum.522.f: "The doctor has found that in many known cases yellow fever has a mild manifestation that passes after a few days. An estimated five out of six patients experience this mild form of yellow fever. The other course of the disease is dangerous and can be fatal. Patients suffer a second, toxic course. It is characterized by recurring fever, accompanied by jaundice due to liver damage, as well as abdominal pain. Bleeding in the mouth, nose, eyes, and the gastrointestinal tract cause vomit containing blood, hence one of the names in Spanish for yellow fever, vómito negro ('black vomit'). There may also be kidney failure, hiccups, and delirium. An estimated 20 to 50 percent of yellow fever victims who reach this second stage of the disease died - the academic concludes in the report presented."
 panum.523.t: "Yellow Fever Seasons"
 panum.523.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has found that yellow fever epidemics follow a certain temporal pattern."
 panum.523.f: "Historical records and current data suggest that yellow fever occurs primarily in summer. Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has not yet been able to explain why the disease does not occur annually like influenza, but rather disappears completely over long periods of time. It is striking that yellow fever was particularly rampant in rainy years."
 panum.524.t: "A Local Disease?"
 panum.524.d: "When describing the disease of yellow fever, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] emphasizes the fact that yellow fever is a disease that is limited to certain territories and spreads primarily in swampy and tropical areas, with a few exceptions."
 panum.524.f: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has reviewed several reports and records of other yellow fever epidemics. What is striking is that these took place in a very limited area. Tropical regions and swamps in Africa and America are primarily affected. Although in some cases the epidemic is moving further north - for example to Philadelphia in the USA and to Barcelona in Spain - the doctor is convinced that certain climate zones have something to do with the occurrence of the disease. The fact that there have been isolated outbreaks of the disease in English ports doesn't bother [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim] - because the disease hasn't spread much further than the surrounding area of port city."
