 curie.10.f: "Uranium (named after the planet Uranus) is a chemical element with the element symbol U and the atomic number 92. Uranium compounds were used throughout the 19th century to color glass and ceramics, vases and decorative pieces, but also everyday objects such as bowls or glasses. Glass manufacturers in Joachimsthal (Bohemia) used this technique as early as 1826. Uranium was used to color glass until the middle of the 20th century, only then was it replaced by other, less harmful coloring minerals. Uranium-containing ceramic glazes ranging from orange to bright red were used on everything from tableware to architectural accessories. This ceramic, called 'Fiestaware' in the USA because of the name of a manufacturer, is probably one of the most radioactive items that can still be found in many American households."

 verrier_astro_physics_tech_desc: "Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. As one of the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, Astrophysics 'seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space - what they are, rather than where they are'." #Please replace

 verrier_modern_physics_tech: "Modern Physics"
 verrier_modern_physics_tech_desc: "Modern physics is a branch of physics that developed in the early 20th century. Notable branches of modern physics include quantum mechanics, special relativity and general relativity. It is concerned with extreme conditions, such as high velocities that are comparable to the speed of light, small distances comparable to the atomic radius, and very high energies."

 verrier_nuclear_physics_tech: "Nuclear Physics"
 verrier_nuclear_physics_tech_desc: "Nuclear physics is the branch of physics that deals with the structure and behavior of atomic nuclei. Nuclear physics deals with the elucidation of the nuclear structure, i.e. the details of the structure of the atomic nuclei and their reactions. For this purpose, for example, spontaneous transformations of nuclei (radioactivity), scattering processes on nuclei and reactions with nuclei are investigated experimentally and theoretically. Technologies based on nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are based on nuclear physics research."
