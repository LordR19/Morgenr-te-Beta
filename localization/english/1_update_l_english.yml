 klimt.1300.t: "Carl Spitzweg, The Poor Poet"
 klimt.1300.d: "The Poor Poet (German: Der arme Poet) is the best known and most popular painting by German painter Carl Spitzweg. It was executed in 1839 and had three versions. It is considered an early masterpiece."
 klimt.1300.f: "Carl Spitzweg was a German romanticist painter and poet. He is considered to be one of the most important artists of the Biedermeier era. His father, a wealthy merchant, had Carl trained as a pharmacist. He attained his qualification from the University of Munich, but while recovering from an illness he also took up painting. Spitzweg was self-taught as an artist, and began by copying the works of Flemish masters. He contributed his first work to satiric magazines. Upon receiving an inheritance in 1833, he was able to dedicate himself to painting. His later paintings and drawings were often humorous genre works. Many of his paintings depict sharply characterized eccentrics."
 klimt.1300.g: "Ahahah, a funny painter!"
 klimt.1300.h: "Wait! Satire against whom?"

Morse originally decided to lay the wire underground, asking Ezra Cornell to lay the line using a special cable-laying plow that Cornell had developed. However, the project was stopped after about 9.3 miles of wire was laid because the line was failing. Morse learned that Cooke and Wheatstone were using poles for their lines in England and decided to follow their lead. A test of the still incomplete line occurred on May 1, 1844, when news of the Whig Party's nomination of Henry Clay for U.S. President was sent from the party's convention in Baltimore to the Capitol Building in Washington. Morse's line was demonstrated on May 24, 1844, from the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the United States Capitol in Washington to the Mount Clare station of the railroad in Baltimore, and commenced with the transmission of Morse's first message (from Washington) to Alfred Vail (in Baltimore)."

From 1836 onwards, the Magnetic Association founded for this purpose and the British Royal Society provided data that he and Wilhelm Weber evaluated. The aim was to measure the fluctuations of the earth's magnetic field in a coordinated manner using numerous measuring stations distributed all over the world. Up to 50 observatories took part in this project, including 35 in Europe, six in Asia, two in Africa, three in North America and four in Oceania.

It takes around a year to build a new radio station, with an [concept_gaudi_engineer] speeding up the process. Completion is even faster if it is an [concept_gaudi_electrical_engineer]."

 gaudi_radio_network_button: "Wireless Transmissions"
 gaudi_radio_network_button_desc: "The time for annoying tangled cables is over! With the invention of radio technology, messages can now be sent via antenna. This not only makes it possible to exchange news, but also to establish radio programs. Before that, of course, a nationwide network of radio stations needs to be set up."

 gaudi.1421.t: "Radio Network"
 gaudi.1421.d: "The invention of wireless telegraphy makes miracles possible. From now on, messages can be sent from any location to another, without any transmission towers, provided the right technical equipment is available."
 gaudi.1421.f: "In 1897, Karl Ferdinand Braun joined the line of wireless pioneers. His major contributions were the introduction of a closed tuned circuit in the generating part of the transmitter, its separation from the radiating part (the antenna) by means of inductive coupling, and later on the usage of crystals for receiving purposes. Wireless telegraphy claimed Dr. Braun's full attention in 1898, and for many years after that he applied himself almost exclusively to the task of solving its problems. Dr. Braun had written extensively on wireless subjects and was well known through his many contributions to the Electrician and other scientific journals. In 1899, he would apply for the patent Wireless electro transmission of signals over surfaces."

The nearby factory is preparing for this and has improved the efficiency of its own production in order to be prepared for a possible rush of customers."
 gaudi.1424.f: "In 1909, the world's first news station began operating with a regular program at 14 watts. The station in San José, California, was created by physicist Charles 'Doc' Herrold and students from his College of Wireless and Engineering. In 1921 this station, now a commercial one, was given the identifier KQW, which was later taken over by CBS."

A commission decided in June 1835 that the palace should be rebuilt on the same site; either Gothic style or Tudor style. In 1836, after examining 97 competitive proposals, the commission selected Charles Barry's plan, which envisaged a reconstruction in the Gothic style."
 gaudi_ben_phase_2_decision: "A distinctive Bell"
 gaudi_ben_phase_2_decision_desc: "The name Big Ben refers to the heaviest of the five bells of the famous clock tower at the Palace of Westminster in London, weighing 13.5 tons. The tower has a height of 96.3 meters, with the first 61 meters made of brick with a limestone facade and the top made of cast iron. Charles Barry, the architect of the Palace of Westminster, commissioned Augustus Pugin to design the tower. The clockwork was developed in 1848 by Sir George Airy and Edmund Denison and manufactured by clockmaker Edward John Dent. The diameter of the four dials is seven meters each. Under each of the four dials is the Latin inscription 'Domine salvam fac reginam nostram Victoriam primam' (God save our Queen Victoria the First)."

 je_gaudi_eiffel_phase_1: "Tour Eiffel"
 je_gaudi_eiffel_phase_1_reason: "With the technical possibilities of industrialization, ideas arose to build tall buildings. Tower structures in particular reflected the spirit of the times. On May 1, 1886, Trade Minister Édouard Lockroy announced the ideas competition for the buildings of the Paris World Exhibition, which was aimed at French architects and engineers. Around 100 applicants took part, many of whom took up the idea of a tower structure. After the first selection, three templates remained, including Eiffel's contribution and the designs by Ferdinand Dutert and Jean Camille Formigé. Eiffel had Sauvestre's heavily decorated version revised again without removing some decorative elements and won the competition with this compromise proposal."
 je_gaudi_liberty_phase_1: "Lady Liberty"
 je_gaudi_liberty_phase_1_reason: "The sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi proposed erecting a Statue of Liberty as a sign of brotherhood between the French and American people and in memory of the common struggle in the War of Independence and for the ideals of the Enlightenment. She should be the symbol of a free and democratic America. The centenary celebrations in the USA in 1876 gave this idea new impetus."

 je_gaudi_ben_phase_1_reason: "On October 16, 1834, a devastating fire destroyed most of the Palace of Westminster. The Ministry of Finance had decided to burn the notched wood that had become superfluous after a tax reform in 1826. The two wagonloads were burned in two ovens, causing fire to break out in the Lords Chamber. Only Westminster Hall, the Jewel Tower, the crypt of St Stephen's Chapel and the cloisters escaped destruction.

 gaudi.2101.d: "With great interest from the public, construction work began with excavation work for the foundations. A total of 30,973 cubic meters of earth will be excavated for this purpose. The Eiffel Tower has already set a record without having to lay a single steel beam."
 gaudi.2101.f: "'This tower will not only symbolize the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.' -Gustave Eiffel"
 gaudi.2101.g: "To the sky, to the stars!"
 gaudi.2102.t: "Inauguration of the Eiffel Tower"
 gaudi.2102.d: "The steel titan, whose completion was both feared and longed for, now rises above the French capital. The whole of Paris lies in the shadow of a tower - which has become the city's new landmark. The critics were silenced by the enthusiasm with which the inauguration was celebrated."
 gaudi.2102.f: "'Before the fait accompli - and what a fact! - we have to bow. I, like many others, have said and believed that the Eiffel Tower is madness, but it is a grand and proud madness. Certainly, this enormous mass overwhelms the rest of the exhibition, and when you step out onto the Champ de Mars again, the huge domes and galleries seem tiny. But what do you want? The Eiffel Tower appeals to the imagination, it is something unexpected, something fantastic that flatters our smallness. When it was barely under way, the most famous artists and writers, from Meissonier to Zola, signed a fiery protest against the tower as a terrible crime against art. Would you still sign him today? No, certainly not, and they would prefer that this document of wrath did not exist.'"
 gaudi.2102.g: "Vive la France!"
 gaudi.2109.t: "Paris lost!"
 gaudi.2109.d: "With the loss of Paris, we lost every opportunity to continue building the Eiffel Tower."
 gaudi.2109.f: "Should Paris be lost for any reason, the construction progress #R will be lost as a whole#!. Only France can continue building the Eiffel Tower. Foreign invaders will show no interest in constructing it."
 gaudi.2109.g: "We can't leave Paris to them for long!"

 gaudi.2111.t: "Elevators"
 gaudi.2111.d: "New technological advances in the field of elevator technology have allowed construction work on the Eiffel Tower to progress unexpectedly faster."
 gaudi.2111.f: "The ascent in the Eiffel Tower is made possible by a total of nine different elevators - five in the tower pillars, which run between the entrance and the second floor, and two pairs of elevators with double cabins between the second and third floors. When building the tower, Eiffel deliberately used different techniques and manufacturers in order to remain independent in the event of an error. Otis elevators worked in the north and south pillars until 1910. Until 1897 there were elevators from Roux, Combaluzie and Lepape in the east and west pillars. They could transport up to 200 people with the help of an endless double chain. Both systems were operated by a hydraulic conveyor system. On the occasion of the 1900 World's Fair, Eiffel replaced the elevators and the steam engines that powered the hydraulics with electric motors."
 gaudi.2111.g: "Magnifique!"
 gaudi.2112.t: "Outcry of the Intellectuals"
 gaudi.2112.d: "In a renowned daily newspaper, several figureheads of intellectual, academic and artistic life have protested against the construction of the Eiffel Tower, which they castigate as an ugly eyesore."
 gaudi.2112.f: "'We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection ... of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower ... To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years ... we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.'"
 gaudi.2112.g: "Postpone the construction."
 gaudi.2112.h: "This protest encourages us to build the tower even faster!"
 gaudi.2113.t: "Industrialists applaud the Titan of Steel"
 gaudi.2113.d: "The ever-growing Eiffel Tower is seen by the country's industrialists as a symbol of France's economic and technical progress. They look forward to the opening with enthusiasm."
 gaudi.2113.f: "The entrepreneur and archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, who had already been able to climb the Eiffel Tower before the official opening, praised the building in a letter to Rudolf Virchow on May 24, 1889 as a miracle of engineering skills, without which the world exhibition in Paris had no appeal. Despite the euphoria that praised it as a successful national self-portrayal and demonstration of technical progress, there was also unforgiving criticism."
 gaudi.2113.g: "Maybe you can help a bit?"
 gaudi.2113.h: "Thanks to you!"
 gaudi.2114.t: "Inferrior Steel"
 gaudi.2114.d: "The chief architect heavily criticized the quality of the last steel delivery and had it returned. The schedule for the construction of the Eiffel Tower is shifting noticeably."
 gaudi.2114.f: "Up to 250 people were involved in the construction work, around 150 of whom were used to rivet the components on site. In addition to carpenters, the construction workers also included chimney sweeps, as they were used to working at great heights. The work shifts lasted nine hours in the winter months and twelve hours in the summer months. In September 1888 there was a workers' strike; three months later they stopped work again and demanded more wages. Gustave Eiffel negotiated with them and set up a canteen for them in the first platform that had already been completed. There was only one fatal accident during the entire work. An Italian worker had an accident while installing the elevators after the official opening."
 gaudi.2114.g: "Buy a new load of steel."
 gaudi.2115.t: "Quality Steel"
 gaudi.2115.d: "The steel from the nearby Paris steel mills has proven to be of such high quality in the construction of the Eiffel Tower that this has not only accelerated the efficiency of the work, but has also increased demand for more steel from the mill from other customers."
 gaudi.2115.f: "On August 14, 1888, the second floor was built and the part at the top was cantilevered. At the same time, the platforms were equipped. The individual parts, pre-drilled in the factory, were brought into their final position on site using conical mandrels under impact. A total of 2.5 million rivets hold the components together in the Eiffel Tower. Four men each carried out the riveting. The first worker had the rivet hot-stamped and made it glow using a small forge. As a second step, another worker guided the rivet to the drill hole. A third beat the locking head into shape. In a final step, the bolt was compressed."
 gaudi.2115.g: "French steel is the best steel."
 gaudi.2116.t: "Mathematician predicts Collapse"
 gaudi.2116.d: "After one of France's most respected mathematicians predicted that the Eiffel Tower would collapse at a height of around 230 meters, panic is spreading among some homeowners."
 gaudi.2116.f: "A resident of the Champ de Mars has filed a lawsuit against the state and the city of Paris out of fear that the Eiffel Tower could collapse and destroy his house. The court only allows further construction on the condition that Gustave Eiffel is liable for any damage. This has sparked a fundamental discussion in France and the question arises as to how trustworthy Eiffel's construction and calculations are. However, the industrialists see this criticism as an affront to the idea of progress as such."
 gaudi.2116.g: "That's ridiculous."
 gaudi.2116.h: "Eiffel has to pay if the tower collapses."

The USA decided to build defenses on Bedloe's Island (and also on Governor's Island and Ellis Island) to protect New York Harbor. In June 1871 the sculptor Bartholdi traveled to New York.

 gaudi.2211.f: "'The surfaces should be clear and simple, determined by a bold and clean design, accentuated in the important places. Enlarging or multiplying details should be avoided. By exaggerating the forms to make them more clearly visible or by adding details to them, we would destroy the proportions of the work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, as one would in a rapid draft. It is necessary that this character be the product of volition and observation, and that the artist, through the concentration of his knowledge, find the form and the line in their greatest simplicity.' -Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi"

Instead of grasping in her hand thunderbolts of terror and of death, she holds aloft the light which illumines the way to man's enfranchisement. We will not forget that Liberty has here made her home, nor shall her chosen altar be neglected.

The Statue of Liberty wasn't the only project to suffer from a lack of funding; For example, work on the Washington Monument took three and a half decades with several interruptions. There was criticism of both Bartholdi's statue and the fact that Americans had to pay for the pedestal for this gift. There was also the prevailing opinion that public works of art should be designed by Americans. Harper's Weekly magazine said Bartholdi could have donated both the statue and the base, and the New York Times noted: 'No true patriot can count any such expenditures for bronze women in the present state of our finances.'"

 gaudi.2301.f: "Immediately after the fire, King William IV offered the almost-completed Buckingham Palace to Parliament, hoping to dispose of a residence he disliked. The building was considered unsuitable for parliamentary use, however, and the gift was rejected. Advocacy of a neoclassical design was popular. Decimus Burton created a design for a new neoclassical Houses of Parliament. In contradistinction to the neo-gothic style, they commended those who had built St. Paul's Cathedral, to the satisfaction of an applauding posterity, in the more beautiful and universal style of Roman architecture. Augustus W. N. Pugin, the foremost expert on the Gothic, had to submit each of his designs through, and thus in the name of, other architects, James Gillespie Graham and Charles Barry, because he had recently openly and fervently converted to Roman Catholicism. The design for Parliament that Pugin submitted through Barry won the competition."

Although most of the work had been carried out by 1860 when Charles Barry died, construction was not finished until a decade afterwards, under the supervision of his son Edward Middleton Barry."

Those experts included Sir Martin Archer Shee, P.R.A., and Charles Lock Eastlake, painter and acknowledged authority on art history, soon to be first director of the National Gallery and de facto administrator of the whole Westminster decoration project.
