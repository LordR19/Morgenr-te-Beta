 je_gaudi_neuschwanstein_phase_1_reason: "Neuschwanstein is considered the prime example of historicism and German Romanticism. The fairytale castle, which would later be seen by many as the 'ideal' castle per se, was designed by the Bavarian King Ludwig II. Although it was not uncommon in the 19th century for monarchs to have medieval castles built in a magnificent style, Neuschwanstein should serve as an example surpass and become a landmark not only of Bavaria, but of the entire German-speaking world."

 je_gaudi_neuschwanstein_phase_2_reason: "From the beginning, Neuschwanstein was not intended for representation or the public, but as a private retreat for the king. He based his work on medieval Christian myths, but above all on the operas of Richward Wagner, whom he supported financially and admired. The king's ever-new ideas and his desire to build a stone opera stage for eternity with Neuschwanstein significantly delayed construction and brought Ludwig II to the brink of ruin."

 gaudi.701.t: "Construction of Neuschwanstein begins"
 gaudi.701.d: "The Bavarian King chose a place near the older Hohenschwangau residence, which he knew from his childhood. It is already clear that the actual construction management lies not with the selected architects, but with the monarch."
 gaudi.701.f: "'I intend to have the old Hohenschwangau castle ruins near the Pöllat Gorge rebuilt in the true style of the old German knights' castles.' -King Ludwig II"
 gaudi.701.g: "The king is either a genius or a madman."
 gaudi.702.t: "Neuschwanstein: First Phase finishes"
 gaudi.702.d: "On the hill near Füssen, the Palas is now clearly visible over the Bavarian Allgäu. The Neuschwanstein gatehouse is already there."
 gaudi.702.f: "'... in every respect this castle will be more beautiful and homely than the lower Hohenschwangau...' -King Ludwig II"
 gaudi.702.g: "Looks cheesier than planned."
 gaudi.703.t: "Construction of Neuschwanstein continues"
 gaudi.703.d: "The next construction phase of Neuschwanstein Castle has begun. There are now increasing voices calling the ostentatious building a complete waste of money."
 gaudi.703.f: "Contrary to popular rumors, Ludwig II financed Neuschwanstein entirely from his private assets. Due to his lack of money, he was also receptive to financial donations from the former Prussian counterpart. In order to gain the goodwill of Bavaria at the coronation of the Prussian King Wilhelm as German Kaiser, Bismarck paid the ruler an annual pension of 300,000 Reichsmarks. At the end of his life, Ludwig's private debts amounted to 8.25 million Reichsmarks."
 gaudi.703.g: "How much will it cost?"
 gaudi.703.t: "Neuschwanstein completed"
 gaudi.703.d: "Neuschwanstein was finally completed today! History will show whether the building will go down in the tradition of Louis XIV as an expression of nostalgic megalomania, or whether the myth of the king will live on for centuries. In case of doubt, both should be the case."
 gaudi.703.f: "'I want to remain an eternal enigma to myself and others...' -King Ludwig II"
 gaudi.704.g: "Long live [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetFirstName]!"
 gaudi.709.t: "Bavaria lost!"
 gaudi.709.d: "With the loss of Bavaria, we lost every opportunity to continue building the Neuschwanstein Castle."
 gaudi.709.f: "Should Bavaria be lost for any reason, the construction progress will not be lost as a whole. Only Bavaria can continue building the Neuschwanstein Castle at the last construction phase. Foreign invaders, on the other hand, will show no interest in further construction."
 gaudi.709.g: "We can't leave Bavaria to them for long!"
