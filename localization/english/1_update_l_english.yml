The names were known from other Quipu records, but refer less to place names than to the settlement points of certain clans.

The basic value, which is determined during the preparations, is the sum of the naval technologies researched. Advances in the field of food preservation - vacuum canning and pasteurization - also have a very positive effect. Completing oceanographic research from the Pacific Expedition or having a Vanguard Navy brings additional bonuses. With scientists such as engineers and astronomers, this baseline can be improved.

In 1826 Frederick William Beechey explored the north coast of Alaska, discovering Point Barrow. In 1845, a lavishly equipped two-ship expedition led by Sir John Franklin sailed to the Canadian Arctic to chart the last unknown swaths of the Northwest Passage. Confidence was high, as they estimated there was less than 500 km (310 mi) remaining of unexplored Arctic mainland coast.

However, the chosen route from Baffin Bay via Lancaster Sound and Peel Sound and further through James Ross Strait and Simpson Strait was unsuitable for regular shipping as the sea depth was less than one meter in places. However, this does not detract from the nautical and exploratory achievement of the six Norwegians and the Dane Godfred Hansen in conquering the Northwest Passage from east to west for the first time, which many expedition teams had attempted over more than four centuries. During their trip, Amundsen's expedition team found skeletal remains and equipment from John Franklin's lost expedition."

The expedition failed disastrously; From 1845 to 1848 everyone involved died in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The last traces of the expedition members were only discovered many years later near King William Island. The tragic fate of the Franklin expedition, long obscured, attracted widespread attention in the mid-19th century.

 verrier.142.t: "The Solar Flare"
 verrier.142.d: "While observing solar flares, [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] noticed a highly unusual phenomenon. If his theory is correct, then a solar storm is racing toward Earth. On the one hand, this is a sensation of groundbreaking scientific significance. However, it could also be dangerous."
 verrier.142.f: "A solar flare is a structure of increased radiation within the Sun's chromosphere that is powered by magnetic field energy. An absorption spectrum of a flare region typically shows helium and calcium in addition to hydrogen. The areas emit increased short-wave radiation in the ultraviolet and X-ray ranges as well as protons, electrons and ions. On Earth, this causes disturbances in the ionosphere with corresponding impairments in radio traffic. When the particles enter the Earth's atmosphere, they cause magnetic storms. Ionospheric storms occur when particles slowly penetrating the aurora zones cause the auroras to be visible at night and strongly fluctuating electrical currents cause geomagnetic disturbances."
 verrier.142.g: "What does that mean, Professor?"
 verrier.143.t: "The [SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_carrington_discoverer').GetLastName] Event"
 verrier.143.d: "A magnetic storm has hit the Earth! This unique natural event has resulted in the Northern Lights being visible even in Rome, Havana and China. People are amazed by that celestial spectacle. Apparently it has something to do with a solar flare discovered by the Astronomer [SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_carrington_discoverer').GetFullName]."
 verrier.143.f: "From August 28 to September 4, 1859, several powerful solar flares occurred, observed in particular by the astronomer Richard Carrington. The material ejected from the coronal mass ejections had a speed of over 2000 km/s. This reached Earth about 17.5 hours later. The most powerful geomagnetic storm to date was recorded on the night of September 1st to 2nd. Auroras were seen around the world in both northern and southern hemispheres. The aurora over the Rocky Mountains in the United States was so bright that the glow woke gold miners, who began preparing breakfast because they thought it was morning. People in the northeastern United States could read a newspaper by the aurora's light. The aurora was visible from the poles to low latitude areas such as south-central Mexico, Cuba, Hawaii, Queensland, southern Japan and China, and even at lower latitudes very close to the equator, such as in Colombia."
 verrier.143.g: "This is terrible and fantastic at the same time."
 verrier.144.t: "The Telegraphy System collapses"
 verrier.144.d: "Because of the geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field, telegraph systems all over Europe and North America failed, in some cases giving their operators electric shocks. Such high voltages were induced in telegraph lines that strips of paper in the receivers were set on fire by sparks. Some operators were able to continue to send and receive messages despite having disconnected their power supplies."
 verrier.144.f: "Boston operator (to Portland operator): 'Please cut off your battery entirely for fifteen minutes.'\nPortland operator: 'Will do so. It is now disconnected.'\nBoston: 'Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?'\nPortland: 'Better than with our batteries on. Current comes and goes gradually.'\nBoston: 'My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble.'\nPortland: 'Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?'\nBoston: 'Yes. Go ahead.'"
