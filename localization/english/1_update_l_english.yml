######GAUDÍ######

gaudi_captain: "Captain"
gaudi_nemo: "Nemo"

gaudi_nautilus_modifier: "Mobilis In Mobili"
gaudi_nautilus_strikes_modifier: "Anti-Imperialist Vengeance"

gaudi_nemo_button: "Hunt the Monster"
gaudi_nemo_button_desc: "A small expedition with an experienced naturalist on board should help us find out more about the danger posed by the unknown monster."

je_gaudi_nemo: "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas"
je_gaudi_nemo_reason: "A mysterious sea monster, which eyewitnesses believe is a giant narwhal, is attacking our commercial shipping and even attacking ports. With the help of a naturalist, we can send out an expedition to learn more about the creature - and possibly stop it."

gaudi.90.t: "Mysterious Whale sinks Ship!"
gaudi.90.d: "There are more and more reports that were initially dismissed as sailor's superstition but can no longer be dismissed. In essence, over a period of time several ships had encountered 'an enormous thing' at sea, a long spindle-shaped object, sometimes giving off a phosphorescent glow, infinitely bigger and faster than any whale.'\n\nSeveral ships of the merchant marine have been lost at sea over the past year to a strange phenomenon, believed by many to be a large and as of yet undiscovered species of whale."
gaudi.90.f: "The facts relating to this apparition agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, a surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the ichthyologists of the day."
gaudi.90.g: "But is it really a whale?"
gaudi.91.t: "Mysterious Whale attacks again!"
gaudi.91.d: "The mysterious monster has struck again! The entire merchant shipping industry is horrified."
gaudi.91.f: "The engineers visited the Scotia, which was put in dry-dock. They could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below water-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle. The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it could not have been more neatly done by a punch. It was clear, then, that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common stamp; and after having been driven with prodigious strength, and piercing an iron plate one and three-eighth inches thick, had withdrawn itself by a retrograde motion truly inexplicable."
gaudi.91.g: "This nefarious threat to the peace on the high seas must end!"
gaudi.92.t: "Mysterious Whale attacks coast!"
gaudi.92.d: "The whale - or whatever - has attacked a port city and left a path of destruction in its wake."
gaudi.92.f: "The hypothesis of the floating island, and the unapproachable sand-bank, supported by minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned. And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity? From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck was given up.\n\nThere remained then only two possible solutions of the question, which created two distinct parties; on one side, those who were for a monster of colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a submarine vessel of enormous motive power."
gaudi.93.t: "The Professor and his Monster"
gaudi.93.d: "After [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetFullName] inquired about the last crime scene of the unknown creature, he set out with a brave team to search for the monster."
gaudi.93.f: "'The great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us. Soundings cannot reach them. What passes in those remote depths—what beings live, or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the waters—what is the organization of these animals—we can scarcely conjecture. However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may modify the form of the dilemma. Either we do know all the varieties of beings which people our planet, or we do not. If we do not know them all, if Nature has still secrets in ichthyology for us, nothing is more conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or cetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organization formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an accident of some sort, either fantastical or capricious, has brought at long intervals to the upper level of the ocean.'"
gaudi.93.g: "Good luck!"
gaudi.94.t: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] is missing!"
gaudi.94.d: "The sea monster attacked the ship that wanted to investigate it. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetFullName] fell overboard in the fight with the monster! Despite searching for days, they couldn't find him."
gaudi.94.f: "'At this moment, leaning on the forecastle bulwark, I saw below me Ned Land grappling the martingale in one hand, brandishing his terrible harpoon in the other, scarcely twenty feet from the motionless animal. Suddenly his arm straightened, and the harpoon was thrown; I heard the sonorous stroke of the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard body. The electric light went out suddenly, and two enormous waterspouts broke over the bridge of the frigate, rushing like a torrent from stem to stern, over-throwing men, and breaking the lashing of the spars. A fearful shock followed, and, thrown over the rail without having time to stop myself, I fell into the sea.'"
gaudi.94.g: "No! Not Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName]!"
gaudi.95.t: "Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] washes ashore!"
gaudi.95.d: "The renowned naturalist [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetFullName] was found washed up on our shores today. The professor has been gone for quite some time since joining an expedition sent out to discover the truth behind a mysterious whale said to sink and devour ships on the high seas. The professor is shocked by the profound experience he has had, and his story is indeed remarkable. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] claims that he was washed overboard during a close encounter between his ship and the creature, and that the creature is in fact a human ship, capable of under water travel. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] maintains that the ship is, or was, commanded by a freedom-loving vigilante who has sworn off all contact with terra firma in favor of a free life on the world's oceans aboard his ship. Whatever the truth, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName]'s many detailed accounts of many strange new life forms - supposedly encountered during his voyage as a guest aboard this strange vessel - will be a boon for our scientific efforts for years to come."
gaudi.95.f: "'It is evidently a gigantic narwhal, and an electric one.' -[SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_nemo_scope').GetFullName]"
gaudi.95.g: "But is Captain Nemo really defeated?"
