 panum.122.f: "The doctor estimates this period to be about half a day to five days, with the average being three days. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has held several discussions with victims of the disease and their relatives. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe|U] was therefore able to reconstruct the events based on several eyewitness reports. Even if the cause remains obscure, conclusions may later be drawn from this observations as to what exactly happened on day 1."
 panum.122.g: "Well observed."
 panum.124.g: "Precisely observed."
 panum.123.t: "Cholera Symptoms"
 panum.123.d: "Today Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] sent to the Medical Faculty a comprehensive list of cholera symptoms."
 panum.123.f: "As is already known, but so far only rudimentarily processed, cholera is a disease of the human small intestine. The consequences are extreme diarrhea with a typical blue-colored 'rice water stool' and severe vomiting. Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was said to have a certain sadistic streak because [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] sent a full description of these and other extremely unsavory symptoms in time for the academic dinner."
 panum.124.t: "Cholera Asiatica"
 panum.124.d: "In a highly acclaimed report, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] worked out the differences between cholera and other cholera-like diseases, which is considered a milestone in future disease description."
 panum.124.f: "The name cholera, which is derived from the Greek word for bile, originally referred to all possible forms of diarrhea or intestinal problems ('bile flow'). Although Jakob de Bondt had already described a specifically Indian cholera disease in 1642, cholera remained purely a collective term. It was only with the emergence of the major cholera pandemics of the 19th century that this specific, new type of cholera, which turned out to be the most devastating disease of the century, was also defined with a proper name to clearly differentiate it: Cholera Asiatica."

 panum.222.t: "Tuberculosis Incubation"
 panum.222.d: "In his research on tuberculosis, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] noticed some oddities related to the disease. Apparently it can take weeks before a sick person actually shows typical symptoms."
 panum.222.f: "Whether miasma theory or germ theory: tuberculosis still poses a mystery. If it is an infectious disease, it can apparently take weeks for the symptoms to break out: the doctor assumes between two and even twelve weeks! In addition, not everyone who lives with someone who is sick seems to become infected directly, as [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] found out in numerous surveys of patients and relatives. Either the academics are right with their theory that tuberculosis is not an infectious disease and other factors are responsible, or the risk of infection is lower than first thought."
 panum.223.t: "Tuberculosis Symptoms"
 panum.223.d: "After Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] intensively studied the symptoms of tuberculosis, [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] came to a conclusion that surprised even some academic colleagues: tuberculosis is a much more complicated disease with a wide variety of symptoms that go far beyond lung problems."
 panum.223.f: "Although the attack on the lungs and their painful, slow destruction is one of the best-known features of tuberculosis, coughing is only one of many symptoms. Pulmonary tuberculosis is just one type of tuberculosis, which can also affect other organs. Fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, night sweats or spitting blood were previously known symptoms. The fact that tuberculosis not only attacks the body outside the lungs, but that two different types of tuberculosis can occur at the same time, has significantly changed the worldview of some members of the Medical Faculty."
 panum.224.t: "Tuberculosis and Scrofula"
 panum.224.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] dealt intensively with the various forms of possible tuberculosis diseases and, despite the numerous similarities with other disease symptoms, worked out the specific differences between tuberculosis and scrofula, but at the same time also emphasized the connections."
 panum.224.f: "Descriptions of tuberculosis have existed for centuries, but it did not have comparable, devastating effects until the 19th century due to less urbanization. It was still known under other names well into the 19th century - the term 'consumption' was still used in the English-speaking world until the 20th century. René Laennec is considered one of the pioneers of tuberculosis research who invented the stethoscope for lung examination. Johann Lukas Schönlein coined the term tuberculosis in 1832 and associated it with a specific clinical picture. An important finding of these years was that scrofula and tuberculosis were two different diseases, but they could hardly be differentiated due to the large number of tuberculosis symptoms."

 panum.322.t: "Smallpox Incubation and Symptoms"
 panum.322.d: "In a recent summary, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] noted that the initial symptoms of smallpox are not unlike those of influenza before the infamous pustules appear. It can be assumed that one to two weeks pass between infection and symptoms."
 panum.322.f: "'Those easily restored to health from the plague seem to me to have been previously dried and purged in respect to the whole body, for vomiting occurred in some of them and the stomach was disturbed in all. And, in the same way, in those already purged who were going to be saved, dark pustules appear clearly over the whole body, in most ulcerous, in all dry. (...) On the outside the body was not hot to the touch, nor was there pallor; the skin was rather red, livid, and broke out into small blisters and ulcers.' -Galen"
 panum.323.t: "Chickenpox or Smallpox?"
 panum.323.d: "During [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] observation of smallpox patients, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was able to present a partial report that chickenpox is an independent, harmless disease. This has been a very controversial theory so far."
 panum.323.f: "'Chickenpox breaks out on many without any illness or previous sign: in others they are preceded by a little degree of chillness, lassitude, cough, broken sleep, wandering pains, loss of appetite and feverishness for three days. Most of them are of the common size of the smallpox but some are less. I never saw them confluent nor very numerous. The greatest number which I ever observed was about twelve in the face, and two hundred over the rest of the body. On the second or at the farthest on the third day from the beginning of the eruption as many of the pocks as are not broken seem arrived at their full maturity, and those which are fullest of that yellow liquor very much resemble what the genuine smallpox are on the fifth or sixth day especially where there happens to be a larger space than ordinary occupied by the extravasated serum.' -William Heberden"
 panum.324.t: "The Difference between Measles and Smallpox"
 panum.324.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] compared the symptoms of smallpox sufferers, measles sufferers and chicken pox sufferers with extreme care and was able to classify them very precisely."
 panum.324.f: "'The eruption of smallpox is preceded by a continued fever, pain in the back, itching in the nose and nightmares during sleep. These are the more acute symptoms of its approach together with a noticeable pain in the back accompanied by fever and an itching felt by the patient all over his body. A swelling of the face appears, which comes and goes, and one notices an overall inflammatory color noticeable as a strong redness on both cheeks and around both eyes. One experiences a heaviness of the whole body and great restlessness, which expresses itself as a lot of stretching and yawning. There is a pain in the throat and chest and one finds it difficult to breathe and cough. Additional symptoms are: dryness of breath, thick spittle, hoarseness of the voice, pain and heaviness of the head, restlessness, nausea and anxiety. Note the difference: restlessness, nausea and anxiety occur more frequently with measles than with smallpox. At the other hand, pain in the back is more apparent with smallpox than with measles.' -Rhazes"

 panum.422.t: "Typhus Symptoms & Incubation"
 panum.422.d: "In a first interim report, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] listed the symptoms of typhus, as well as an initial estimate of when they first appear in the course of the disease."
 panum.422.f: "'Fever, chills, headache, cough, rash, vomiting - all these are signs of typhus. However, all these symptoms can be found in similar diseases, too. Nausea and confusion on the other hand are typical for classic typhus. The characteristic course of the fever is a two to three day rise in temperature, followed by a continuous fever of around ten days and subsequent defervescence over several days. According to my calculations, it takes around ten to fourteen days between infection and the first symptoms.'"
 panum.423.t: "The Camp Fever"
 panum.423.d: "After Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] compares historical reports of epidemics in the military with the current symptoms of typhus sufferers, he comes to the conclusion that equating typhus and 'camp fever' is of little help."
 panum.423.f: "'It is certainly a camp fever - but is it THE camp fever?' Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] asked questions like these that got the members of the Medical Faculty thinking. Historically known as 'camp fever', it has long been associated with epidemics in the major armies or barracks, particularly as the disease that inflicted massive casualties on the Napoleonic Army. But not all illnesses in the army known as 'camp fever' can be equated with typhus. Relapsing fever and trench fever are other diseases known to have affected military personnel in confined spaces. The illness that particularly raged during the American Civil War, on the other hand, is often referred to as typhus, but was actually typhoid fever."
 panum.424.t: "Typhus: Two Diseases in one?"
 panum.424.d: "While examining typhus patients, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] discovered that a number of assumptions were fundamentally wrong. If previous doctors had diagnosed a 'morbid change' in the intestines, [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] could not detect any of this in those who died of typhus. Rather, the doctor assumes that the intestinal disease is an illness that must be distinguished from typhus, which [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] calls 'typhoid fever'."
 panum.424.f: "Until the middle of the 19th century, doctors did not differentiate between typhus and typhoid fever. They were simply considered to be manifestations of the same disease with varying degrees of symptoms. In 1836, the American physician William Gerhard observed that in some typhus sufferers the intestines were not affected by the disease, even though it had been one of the commonly diagnosed symptoms up to that point. Further, similar observations led him to believe that typhus was not a disease of the intestines, but rather attacked other organs: mental confusion and muscle pain were much more common than problems of the digestive tract. The centuries-long identification of typhus and typhoid fever has not only led to a similarity in names, but has also led to the fact that in some languages typhoid fever is referred to as typhus, for example in German."

 panum.522.t: "Two Courses of Yellow Fever"
 panum.522.d: "In [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] close observation of yellow fever, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] made the discovery that the disease can progress in two ways."
 panum.522.f: "The doctor has found that in many known cases yellow fever has a mild manifestation that passes after a few days. An estimated five out of six patients experience this mild form of yellow fever. The other course of the disease is dangerous and can be fatal. Patients suffer a second, toxic course. It is characterized by recurring fever, accompanied by jaundice due to liver damage, as well as abdominal pain. Bleeding in the mouth, nose, eyes, and the gastrointestinal tract cause vomit containing blood, hence one of the names in Spanish for yellow fever, vómito negro ('black vomit'). There may also be kidney failure, hiccups, and delirium. An estimated 20 to 50 percent of yellow fever victims who reach this second stage of the disease died - the academic concludes in the report presented."
 panum.523.t: "Yellow Fever Seasons"
 panum.523.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has found that yellow fever epidemics follow a certain temporal pattern."
 panum.523.f: "Historical records and current data suggest that yellow fever occurs primarily in summer. Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has not yet been able to explain why the disease does not occur annually like influenza, but rather disappears completely over long periods of time. It is striking that yellow fever was particularly rampant in rainy years."
 panum.524.t: "A Local Disease?"
 panum.524.d: "When describing the disease of yellow fever, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] emphasizes the fact that yellow fever is a disease that is limited to certain territories and spreads primarily in swampy and tropical areas, with a few exceptions."
 panum.524.f: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has reviewed several reports and records of other yellow fever epidemics. What is striking is that these took place in a very limited area. Tropical regions and swamps in Africa and America are primarily affected. Although in some cases the epidemic is moving further north - for example to Philadelphia in the USA and to Barcelona in Spain - the doctor is convinced that certain climate zones have something to do with the occurrence of the disease. The fact that there have been isolated outbreaks of the disease in English ports doesn't bother [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim] - because the disease hasn't spread much further than the surrounding area of port city."

Ingested, it develops in the bowel, and manifests into the cholera we have learnt to fight. It is a lesson hard learned, but quickly acted upon. Last week, they removed the handles from the water pump at the heart of this outbreak. Today, I retire to the evening without a single new case brought to my table. It is irrefutable. The beast is slain.\n\nYet, I do feel a pange of lament for all this. I do not wish that I could claim full, sole responsibility for the discoveries we made here, only that they could have been discovered even sooner.

The resulting area is vast, encompassing well over a hundred homes, but it also forms a vast circle.\n\nThis goes against traditional thought. If it were a miasma, then surely it would be carried by the breeze, travelling along the prevailing winds. Instead, it goes beyond the winds, round and unsettlingly neat. I walked to the center of it all, perhaps hoping to find some clue...and found none other than a water pump. Every house upon the chart was in walking distance.

It was no more than the usual, if that. Return south, and one finds the streets to be ablaze with cholera, filled with the stench of unset bowels and death. Could this be a localization of miasmatic soil?\n\nI think not. It seems too cleanly marked. I contacted the honorable gentlemen of the New River Company, and they informed me that their pipes were recently closed whilst they added new filters, at great expense, to their pumping station. Could these filters be playing some unseen part in this?

A few dozen samples gathered from local water, carefully prepared, and each viewed under the microscope. Some came from areas with less cholera.

The ones ridden with filth of the vilest kind?\n\nThose were the ones from the areas worst affected. A brushed brow, a moment's thought.

Do you see the way the rain flows down into the earth, here?'\n\n'Aye, I do, but what of it?'\n\n'The rainwater flows from this cesspit down there, towards the gutters.

It would seem a remnant of an earlier day in this city's history, when this part was wealthier than a petty slum. The master of the house was quite fascinated by the investigation, and provided me with a great many books on local history in the hopes that they might shine light on past outbreaks. More interestingly, they made it clear that cholera has yet to reach past their walls.\n\nThat was quite fascinating to me, for by the principals of miasma theory, the sickness is in the air, in the smell, and should not discriminate between rich or poor in this manner. Even his servants are not afflicted, those that live within the quarters, at least. They eat from the storeroom and drink from the artesian well within the walls, and somehow, this makes them unaffected. A curious conundrum.

 je_panum_germ_theory_reason: "Hippocrates of Kos is considered to be the founder of the theory of miasms, the toxic exhalations from the soil that are carried away in the air and thus contribute to the spread of diseases. In the 19th century, due to a lack of knowledge about bacteria and viruses, doctors and researchers simply attributed epidemics such as cholera to bad smells that were spread via 'miasmas'. This theory later proved to be a wrong path in medicine, although the miasma model already partly explained where epidemics come from and how they spread. The conflict between the contagionists, who claimed human-to-human infection, and the anticontagionists, the supporters of the miasma theory, was bitter at times in the middle of the 19th century. The weaknesses of the miasm model were recognized in London, although the makeshift rules for dealing with miasms, such as cleanliness and isolation, did limit epidemics to some extent.\n\nShould a nation find sufficient evidence in favor of the germ theory and against the miasma theory, then this paradigm shift will allow for fewer negative events in the search for treatment methods or in epidemics.

 panum.622.f: "'It cannot be denied that the desquamation stage may be infectious, but one should be cautious in accepting this view inasmuch as on general grounds one would suspect the opposite. It almost appears that because such a long latent period could not be conceived, a later stage of the illness was chosen as the infecting one. In the villages of Hove and Lobre, on Suderø, towards the end of the epidemic, there occurred an interval of longer than fourteen days between generations of the exanthem in the same household, without my being able to demonstrate a new infection from without; yet these two cases can be explained by an infection which was transmitted during the stage of convalescence. From the data here presented, I believe that the incubation period of measles can be estimated with great assurance to be about fourteen days, without, however, insisting that this interval is one which cannot be modified by particular circumstances, as, for example, a journey; many factors speak a priori against such an absolute dictum, as well as analogy with the uncertainty of the latent periods of other diseases.' -Peter Panum"
 panum.623.t: "Measles uniqueness"

 panum.623.f: "'The literature on measles is insignificant and incomplete in comparison with that en other acute exanthemata, as, for example, scarlet fever and smallpox. Aside from scattered reports in the journals relating to single outbreaks, there are only a few monographs, several of which date back to the preceding century. This exanthematic fever, certainly unknown to Greek and Arabian physicians, was so insufficiently differentiated even in the last century that de Haën maintained the identity of measles with smallpox, on the basis of symptoms, and writers prior to the end of the seventeenth century described both diseases as belonging to the same family.' -Peter Panum"

 panum.624.d: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was recently able to show very clearly that when measles affects an individual, it does not occur again. Populations that have never been exposed to the disease are therefore particularly at risk."
 panum.624.f: "'In this connection it is quite remarkable, however, that of the many aged people still living on the Faroes who had had measles in 1781, not one, as far as I could find out by careful inquiry, was attacked the second time. I myself saw ninety-eight such old people, who were exempt because they had had the disease iii their youth. This was the more noteworthy in that a high age by no means lessened the susceptibility to measles, since, as far as I know, all the old people who had not gone through with measles in earlier life were attacked when they were exposed to infection; whereas certain young persons, although constantly exposed, were exempt. If recovery from measles sixty-five years before could insure people against taking the disease a second time, it might be supposed that still greater protection would be afforded by having recovered from it a shorter time before' -Peter Panum"

 panum.700.f: "Scarlet fever has been known since ancient times and was well described in the 17th century, notably by Thomas Sydenham. Although scarlet fever apparently became less dangerous in the 18th century, it struck back in a new form in the 19th century. Pierre Fidèle Bretonneau, for example, stated that around 1800 he had not known a single fatal case of scarlet fever, while in 1824 he observed an epidemic in Tours with such high mortality that he placed scarlet fever on a par with plague and cholera. Scarlet fever is accompanied by a characteristic rash. Unlike smallpox or measles, scarlet fever is characterized by a swollen tonsil area and a strawberry-colored tongue."

 panum.722.f: "It cannot be said with certainty whether scarlet fever was known in ancient times or whether it was confused with similar diseases such as diphtheria, measles and rubella. Evidence of a disease similar to scarlet fever already exists in Celsus, Caelius Aurelianus, Arataeus of Cappadocia and Aetius of Amida. Similar descriptions can be found in the Arabic-Perisian region from the Middle Ages onwards, namely by Avicenna, Ali Abbas and Rhazes. The first definitive description of scarlet fever is a description by Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia from 1553. Another important position is held by the physician Daniel Sennert, also from the 16th century. The name 'Scarlatina' goes back to Thomas Sydenham and his description from 1675. Although Sydenham's description is considered authoritative, there are significant gaps in it, and the term scarlet fever also appears to have been widespread in England as early as the middle of the 16th century."

 panum.723.f: "'The patients feel rigoros and shivering, just as they do in other fevers. The symptoms, however, are moderate; afterwards the whole skin becomes covered with small red maculae, thicker than those of measles, as well as broader, redder, and less uniform. These last for two or three days and then disappear. The patient not only has a rash, but also inflammation of the tonsils.

It is thought that the pandemic originated from Yunnan which saw an outbreak as early as 1792, in 1855 and again in 1866. An outbreak in neighboring city of Guangzhou from January 1894 onwards killed 80,000. From March 1894, British scientists and doctors in Hong Kong became aware of the outbreak.

 panum.806.f: "A plague house was used to care for plague patients during plague epidemics. Since the epidemic was considered incurable during the peak period of these waves of illness, in the late Middle Ages and early modern times, and was therefore only a relief as a result of medical care, plague houses were primarily intended to isolate the sick from the healthy population. For this purpose, plague houses similar to leprosoriums were usually built outside or on the outskirts of a city. Another type of plague house was intended to serve prevention in the sense of a quarantine period. People in whose immediate vicinity the plague had occurred were taken to the plague house, which they were only allowed to leave if they turned out to be uninfected."

 panum.808.f: "'Some again, the most sound, perhaps, in judgment, as they we also the most harsh in temper, of all, affirmed that there was no medicine for the disease superior or equal in efficacy to flight; following which prescription a multitude of men and women, negligent of all but themselves, deserted their city, their houses, their estate, their kinsfolk, their goods, and went into voluntary exile, or migrated to the country parts, as if God in visiting men with this pestilence in requital of their iniquities would not pursue them with His wrath, wherever they might be, but intended the destruction of such alone as remained within the circuit of the walls of the city; or deeming, perchance, that it was now time for all to flee from it, and that its last hour was come.' -Bocaccio"

Through maritime traffic, the epidemic spread to the rest of the country after 1894 and eventually spread to British Raj India where about ten million Indians were killed. The main preventive measures were setting up plague hospitals and deploying medical staff to treat and isolate plague patients; conducting house-to-house search operations, discovering and transferring plague patients, and cleaning and disinfecting infected houses and areas; and setting up designated cemeteries and assigning a person responsible for transporting and burying the plague dead."

 panum.811.f: "'I say, then, that such was the energy of the contagion of the said pestilence, that it was not merely propagated from man to man but, what is much more startling, it was frequently observed, that things which had belonged to one sick or dead of the disease, if touched by some other living creature, not of the human species, were the occasion, not merely of sickening, but of an almost instantaneous death. Whereof my own eyes (as I said a little before) had cognisance, one day among others, by the following experience. The rags of a poor man who had died of the disease being strewn about the open street, two hogs came thither, and after, as is their wont, no little trifling with their snouts, took the rags between their teeth and tossed them to and fro about their chaps; whereupon, almost immediately, they gave a few turns, and fell down dead, as if by poison, upon the rags which in an evil hour they had disturbed.' -Boccaccio"

 panum.812.f: "In the wake of the third plague pandemic, European cities created real 'anti-rat corps' that were tasked with specifically searching for and killing the animals or dipping them in buckets of petrol. However, it was often proposed that other sources of plague, such as infected human-specific or human-biting parasites, like fleas and lice, were important for transmission in Europe during the Third Pandemic. The low numbers of plague-infected rats found during European outbreaks suggest that they played a relatively minor role in plague transmission. However, some researchers have argued that the authorities were unlikely to find plague-infected rats because they would go into hiding."

 panum.822.f: "The discovery of the spread of the plague in India had a dominant significance in the view of the plague in its current meaning as a modern disease. It initially led to the view that there was only one way the disease spread. The research has now expanded to include a large number of rodents and a large number of flea species. The high mortality in the colonies led to increased research efforts to map the epidemic features. The fact that it was always the plague was not questioned as the starting point. The disease was given the historical term plague. The identity of the medieval plague with the plague researched in India was assumed."
 panum.823.t: "Plague season"
 panum.823.d: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has gone through all the records. Whether in this epidemic or before, whether in the near or distant past: there are no plague epidemics in winter. Why this is the case remains unclear, but it could play a role in the search for the reasons for the outbreak of the disease."
 panum.823.f: "'Thus ends this year ... It is true we have gone through great melancholy because of the great plague, and I put to great charges by it, by keeping my family long at Woolwich, and myself and another part of my family, my clerks, at my charge at Greenwich ... But now the plague is abated almost to nothing ... But many of such as I know very well, dead. Yet to our great joy, the town fills apace, and shops begin to open again. Pray God continue the plague's decrease - for that keeps the Court away from the place of business, and so all goes to wrack as to public matters, they at this distance not thinking of it.' -Samuel Pepys"
 panum.824.t: "Bubonic Plague and Pneumonic Plague"
 panum.824.d: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was able to show that there is more than just one form of plague."
 panum.824.f: "The plague is usually understood to mean the bubonic plague. The incubation period is a few hours to seven days. The symptoms are fever, headache and body aches, a strong feeling of illness and dizziness. Disturbances of consciousness occur later. The name bubonic plague comes from the severely swollen, very painful bumps on the neck, armpits and groin. Pneumonic plague is significantly rarer. It is likely to be similar to influenza, although its ability to spread is much weaker. The spread is so specific that it can only become an epidemic under particularly favorable circumstances. First of all, the sources of infection are rare. Only a small proportion of the plague-infected population gets pneumonic plague, for example in the case of bubonic plague and weak resistance."

 
 panum.241.t: "The Rabbit Experiment"
 panum.241.d: "Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] comes up with a daring experiment that will ultimately prove the contagiousness of tuberculosis. It's about inoculation. And it's about lots of little dead rabbits."
 panum.241.f: "'For my first experiment, I purchased a pair of cute rabbits three weeks old for the purpose of determining the contagiousness of tuberculosis. I sprinkled one of these with tuberculitic extract from the tissue of a tuberculosis patient who had died 33 hours previously. I repeated the procedure twice. After a few days I dissected the animals and discovered that the rabbit was infected with tuberculosis.\n\nA month later I repeated the experiment with three beautiful little rabbits. I repeated the procedure again, later adding a rabbit. I then dissected one of the rabbits each day for four consecutive days. All of them suffered from tuberculosis, although in four different stages of the disease. I had only inoculated the first one.\n\nIn my third attempt, I acquired four pairs of young, cute rabbits, three months old...'\n\nFrom Doctor [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastNameNoFormatting]'s experimental booklet 'The Cause and Nature of Tuberculosis'"

 panum.261.t: "Artificial Pneumothorax"
 panum.261.d: "Doctor [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has invented a device that artificially collapses the lungs and could help fight tuberculosis."
 panum.261.f: "With the assistance of his brother, Carlo Forlanini designed and constructed a simple device capable of administering gases intrapleurally. The presence of gas in the intrapleural fluid caused the lung to collapse, therefore creating an artificial pneumothorax. After having built the device, Forlanini tried treating two cases of tuberculosis by inducing a pneumothorax in the two patients and obtained positive results. Over the years, Forlanini's technique was further developed and improved, therefore increasing the success rate of the procedure. Artificial pneumothorax continued as a treatment until the introduction of streptomycin."
 panum.262.t: "Thoracoplasty"
 panum.262.d: "Thanks to [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] surgical skills, Doctor [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] invented a procedure that revolutionized lung surgery and thus enabled improved treatment of tuberculosis patients."
 panum.262.f: "A thoracoplasty is a surgical procedure in which ribs or parts of ribs from one side of the chest are surgically removed in order to collapse the lung or parts of the lung. This procedure goes back to Edouarde de Cérenville and was mainly used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, but then became increasingly less important with the introduction of effective antibiotics."
 panum.263.t: "The Doctor did it again!"
 panum.263.d: "In order to once again prove the contagiousness of tuberculosis, Dr. [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] once again killed countless cute rabbits."
 panum.263.f: "'Of the four pairs I acquired this time, I killed the first animal of the first pair immediately. It did not show any lesion of the lungs.'\n\nFrom Doctor [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastNameNoFormatting]'s experimental booklet 'The Cause and Nature of Tuberculosis'"

 panum.440.d: "In his treatise [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('panum_custom_treatment_title')], Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] placed particular emphasis on the fact that typhus is a preventable disease when political and social forces work together."
 panum.440.f: "'Cramped conditions, lice-filled clothing and run-down apartments or soldiers' rooms presented a memorable image to me. Typhus fever was everywhere there. Wherever people lived in the same cramped conditions but under the hygienic conditions of the hospital room, no spread could be observed. Medicine must not be thought of as caring for the individual, but rather in terms of public health, which also implies solving social problems. There can be no doubt that such an epidemic spread of typhus as we have recently seen only occurred under living conditions such as poverty and lack of education. Take these circumstances away and I am sure we will see significant improvements in the fight against the disease.'\n\nDr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] in his memorandum to the government"

 panum.441.f: "'It has long been known that typhoid fever and typhus are two different diseases. But there are still a few researchers who believe that poor nutrition, an infection of the intestinal tract or at least a nutritional deficiency could be linked to the outbreak of typhus. Dietary reasons are still considered a possible cause of many diseases. During my examinations I found nothing that in any way suggested a digestive disorder. Typhus fever has nothing to do with diet or digestion.'\n\nFrom an autopsy report of Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastNameNoFormatting] in [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.Format('y')], [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetCityHubName]"

 panum.442.d: "In [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] search for the cause of the typhus epidemic, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] realized that previous findings had to be questioned."
 panum.442.f: "'I have heard several times in my career that poor hygiene is a way for miasma or germs - whatever people may believe - to take hold in clothes and contribute to illness. I think this is questionable in detail, but not in the basic statement. Soldiers, convicts, the poor, criminals and prostitutes are among the classic victims of the typhus epidemic. But are the unwashed poor because they want to be unwashed, or is it not rather the case that they are unwashed because they are poor? I don't want to believe that tuberculosis is an artist's disease any more than typhus only affects criminals because they are morally wicked. There are numerous rich criminals who have not been affected by typhus in this epidemic. There are blameless priests in the slums who sacrifice themselves for others and who themselves succumb to the disease. So what is the more convincing connection between the victims?'\n\nFrom the journal of Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastNameNoFormatting] in [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.Format('y')], [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetCityHubName]"

 panum.443.d: "After several visits to the homes of families suffering from typhus, Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] comes to the conclusion that it is not, as is often claimed, a seasonal illness."
 panum.443.f: "'There are seasonal diseases and this seems to be the case with typhus as well. Previous reports indicate an increase in the colder seasons, which can also include a wet spring or autumn. I think it has been proven that cold and heat have an influence on sickness. Whether it depends on the seasons is questionable. It can get just as warm in a tightly packed, heated room. The disease did not occur in all places at the same time of year. If that were the case, not only certain areas of a city but the entire city would have to be equally affected. But it always appeared where people were crowded together. I was able to determine this during several home visits.'\n\nFrom the journal of Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastNameNoFormatting] in [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.Format('y')], [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetCityHubName]"

 panum.444.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] is now completely convinced that typhus must be a contagious disease, even if all the circumstances have not yet been clarified."
 panum.444.f: "'At the beginning of my investigation, I was firmly convinced that typhus was not a contagious disease. As my family with typhus increased, however, I grew to firmly believe in the disease's contagion, and I emphasize the contaminating nature of sweat. I saw a male nurse who, while shaving a dying patient, inhaled the patient's breath. The nurse described the patient's breath as having 'a nauseous taste,' and almost immediately fell ill. Similarly, an assistant was supporting another patient who died soon afterwards, he felt the pungent sweat of the patient upon his skin, and the assistant was taken immediately with the symptoms of typhus. It is clear that proximity to typhus patients puts one at risk of contracting the disease.'\n\nFrom the journal of Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastNameNoFormatting] in [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.Format('y')], [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetCityHubName]"

 panum.445.f: "'Is it a special type of typhus, hunger typhus.'\n\n'Hunger typhus?'\n\n'It can be observed that wherever typhus occurs, malnutrition prevails. Accordingly, hunger, or rather famine, is a trigger for typhus. Changes in the blood probably also have something to do with it.'\n\n'1726, 1727 and 1728 were years of famine, but there was no typhus. 1829 was a prosperous year, but there was typhus.

 panum.446.f: "'During my visit to [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetCityHubName] I discovered that the entire illness only affected a single part of the city. The area is known for its poverty and moral depravity, which has supported some theories that typhus is a disease of morally inferior individuals. But as far as I can tell, it's the densely populated neighborhood and the economic situation of those affected. In my opinion, spreading the disease is not about moral corruption, but physical proximity.'\n\nFrom the journal of Dr. [ROOT.Var('panum_physician_var').GetCharacter.GetLastNameNoFormatting] in [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.Format('y')], [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetCityHubName]"

Of course, I lack evidence. In recent years, several scientists have been able to prove again and again that diseases can be transmitted between animals and humans.
