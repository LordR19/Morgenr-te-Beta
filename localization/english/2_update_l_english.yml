 #Pultusk meteor shower happens (maybe 2.2? I dont know)

 #verrier.9020.t: "The Pułtusk meteor shower"
 #verrier.9020.d: "People in Mazowia witnessed something in the sky"
 #verrier.9020.f: "Nestled in the heart of Mazowia, the quaint town of Pułtusk holds a secret from the cosmos. It was here, on a cold winter's day, that a celestial event of unprecedented magnitude unfolded, forever linking this peaceful settlement with the vast, mysterious universe beyond. The year was 1868. On January 30th, the residents of Pułtusk went about their daily routines, unaware that their lives were about to intersect with an extraordinary phenomenon. As the afternoon gave way to the evening, an unusual silence fell over the town. Without warning, a brilliant light pierced the sky. A fireball, more radiant than the sun, blazed across the heavens. Witnesses described it as a blazing orb, trailing a luminous tail, splitting the sky with a thunderous roar. The fireball, later identified as a meteorite, fragmented explosively as it entered Earth's atmosphere. Thousands of pieces rained down over Pułtusk and its surrounding areas, creating a shower of meteoritic stones. This event became known as the Pułtusk meteorite shower."
 #verrier.9020.g: "What a wonderful view!"

 #verrier.9021.t: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] wants to study the meteorites"

 #verrier.9021.f: "[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], an esteemed astronomer, stood at the edge of the field where the Pultusk meteor fragments had fallen. Their eyes shone with excitement as they surveyed the debris scattered across the frozen ground. Clad in a heavy coat against the January cold, they carefully picked up a fragment, their heart racing. This celestial event was a rare opportunity, and they were eager to unlock the secrets of the universe hidden within these ancient stones. Their portable lab buzzed with activity, each new discovery deepening their passion for the mysteries of the heavens."
 #verrier.9021.g: "Our astronomer must give all the meteoroids to our Academy of science!"
