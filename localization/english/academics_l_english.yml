 je_academics_academy: "Academic Careers"
 je_academics_academy_reason: "Depending on the scientific culture in our country, it takes longer or shorter for a researcher to leave the university and become available to us. Examples of academics are: [Concept('concept_gaudi_engineer','$concept_gaudi_engineers$')], [Concept('concept_verrier_astronomer','$concept_verrier_astronomers$')], [Concept('concept_dubois_naturalist','$concept_dubois_naturalists$')], [Concept('concept_dubois_paleontologist','$concept_dubois_paleontologists$')], and [Concept('concept_lepsius_archaeologist','$concept_gaudconcept_lepsius_archaeologistsi_engineers$')]. It is purely coincidental which academic is available at the end - unless we specialize at a university in a particular area. The scientist will then come from this area. The time it takes to graduate depends on factors such as the literacy rate, investments in academic operations, and the expansion of institutions. A selected focus also increases the speed. If an academic comes from a field that is already occupied by another, he replaces his predecessor. So it's important to be careful who you promote."
 je_academics_academy_goal: "It can take 3 to 30 years for an academic to become available."
 je_academics_academy_success: "A new Scientist will appaer."

 je_academics_tech_school: "Academic Focus"
 je_academics_tech_school_reason: "Under certain conditions, a nation can shift its research focus if it specializes its universities in a certain field or mixes them. A specialization (so-called 'Tech School') has an advantage over the traditional academic orientation, but leads to at least one research field being preferred to another. In order to shift towards a Tech School, a specific interest group must be in power, and in certain cases additional requirements must be met - sea power without ships is just as impossible as tycoon capitalism without factories. Some countries begin with a chosen Tech School at the start of the game."
