###Custom Balloonist Altitude Flights###
 curtiss_altitude_under_5000_custom_1: "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] set off for a high altitude flight. With as little weight as possible, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] climbed into the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. The ascent was rapid. Soon [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] could barely make out the people below. The panorama was breathtaking. Despite the rather high altitude, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] was still far from cloud cover. When the barometer read #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_altitude_var').GetValue]#! meters, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] first measured various values with the meteorological equipment before [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] opened a valve and slowly floated back down to earth."

 curtiss_altitude_under_9000_custom_1: "The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] shot up into the air. It had to be light, because [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had made it his goal to fly as high as possible. At first, the houses got smaller and smaller until they were just little dots. Then the balloon floated into the clouds, it felt like fog and small water droplets began to collect on the meteorological equipment. Gradually, it was getting colder. Fortunately, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] had dressed warmly. Slowly, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] felt himself struggling to breathe more and more.\nAt an altitude of #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_altitude_var').GetValue]#! meters, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] began the necessary measurements. Then the long descent began."

 curtiss_altitude_under_12000_no_tools_custom_1: "The air was getting thinner and thinner. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had trouble concentrating. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] head was pounding. A glance at the barometer revealed that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was now higher than any mountain in the world. People could only get this high if they flew. Meanwhile, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] body was starting to shake. The clothes were soaked from the clouds and the temperature was already well into the minus range.\nSo [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] fell to [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] knees. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] could only loosen the valve to initiate the descent with difficulty. Then [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] passed out.\nOnce on the ground, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] regained consciousness. More specifically, in a warm bed. Fortunately, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had been found."

 curtiss_altitude_under_12000_tools_custom_1: "Even with the air bottle, it was not easy. The cold spread through the body of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The air was freezing and it was hard to stand. But the data at this altitude was important. Therefore, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] started taking measurements. The barometer indicated an altitude of #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_altitude_var').GetValue]#! meters. Higher than any mountain in the world. Unfortunately, hardly anything was visible from up here. Dense clouds blocked the view.\n When the measurements were done, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] started releasing air from the envelope of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. The balloon started to sink."

 curtiss_altitude_under_16000_no_tools_custom_1: "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] almost couldn't move [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] own body. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] couldn't even feel the cold anymore. Only the heavy breathing. Up here, the air was extremely thin. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] didn't know if [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] would survive this adventure. With difficulty, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] pulled [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]self up by one of the ropes. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had to reach the valve. So close. Things were slowly getting dark. With [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] teeth, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] enclosed the valve. Started to turn it. Then [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] lost consciousness.\nSo warm. Where was [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe]. Shadows flitted by in front of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]. Slowly, they became people. A woman handed [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim] a bowl of soup. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had apparently survived."

 curtiss_altitude_under_16000_tools_custom_1: "The air bottle helped against the thin air. But the cold penetrated through the thick clothes. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was shivering. But it seemed like [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] made it as high as the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] would allow. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] began taking measurements for the scientific society. The barometer showed #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_altitude_var').GetValue]#! meters. An incredible altitude. Unfortunately, the view was not very good because of the clouds.\nAfter [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] finished taking measurements, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] began to let the air out of the envelope. Slowly, the balloon floated back down."

 curtiss_altitude_over_16000_custom_1: "It was relatively warm in the pressure chamber. The temperature outside, however, was unbearable. Good thing that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was sitting in the chamber and not outside. Breathing was also easy here. From the window [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] looked at the globe. From up here, the curvature of the earth was clearly visible. Towards the top, the blue of the sky became more and more black. Clouds were moving over the earth. From up here they looked like cotton candy. When the barometer read #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_altitude_var').GetValue]#! meters, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] opened a valve from the protection of the pressure chamber, causing the balloon to slowly float back to earth."

###Custom Balloonist Distance Flights###
 curtiss_distance_under_400_custom_1: "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had set the goal to fly as far as possible with the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. While the balloon floated over the landscape, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] was busy with everything that had to be done. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had to find the right altitude to take advantage of the wind as best as possible, keep an eye on the weather, and navigate around. After #p [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloon_time_record_var').GetValue]#! hours of flight, the balloon landed gently on earth. After [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] asked a local resident where [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had landed, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] used a map to calculate the distance traveled. It had to be about #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_distance_var').GetValue]#! kilometers."

 curtiss_distance_under_800_custom_1: "To fly as far as possible in a balloon was not that easy. You had to wait for good weather, have a good balloon and navigate successfully. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] believed that all this was true for [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]. So [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] took off with the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] to set a new distance record. On the way, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] floated over various landscapes, small mountains and rivers. The weather remained good throughout the flight and so [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] was able to land without any problems after #p [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloon_time_record_var').GetValue]#! hours.\nOn the ground, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] asked a local resident where [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had landed. As a result, it was possible to determine the distance traveled to be about #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_distance_var').GetValue]#! kilometers."

 curtiss_distance_under_2000_custom_1: "The weather was perfect for the flight and it stayed that way. During the flight through the air, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was able to see a wide variety of landscapes. From huge cities to small hamlets to uninhabited stretches of land. However, with such a long flight, it was not enough to fly in the balloon only during the day, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] continued to glide through the sky at night as well. Only after an #p [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloon_time_record_var').GetValue]#! hours did [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] decide to land. The balloon slowly floated to the ground where [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] learned from the locals where [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was now. It seemed like [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had travelled #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_distance_var').GetValue]#! Kilometers. A fair distance."

 curtiss_distance_over_2000_custom_1: "For such a long flight as [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had planned, there needed to be enough supplies, several people and the ideal weather. The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] had enough supplies and 2 other people accompanied the balloonist. Fortunately, the weather was also very good that day. So the balloon took off from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] and sailed through the air for hours. In the evening, the three of them enjoyed a delicious meal consisting of wine and a grilled chicken they had brought with them. Through the starry night, they took turns keeping watch. During this #p [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloon_time_record_var').GetValue]#!-hour flight, the balloon covered a huge distance. In total, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] travelled #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_distance_var').GetValue]#! kilometers. An almost unimaginable distance."

###Custom Balloonist Deaths###
 curtiss_custom_death_sea: "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has made a new record flight attempt. In the process, he went off course and drifted out to sea. Every attempt to retrieve [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim] was unsuccessful. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] probably drowned in the sea."

 curtiss_custom_death_hydrogen_ignition: "When the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] ascended to lofty heights, no one expected it to be [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s last ride. At an altitude of about 900 meters, the accident happened. Somehow the hydrogen gas in the balloon ignited. In no time at all, the whole envelope burned and the gondola crashed to the ground. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was killed on impact."

 curtiss_custom_death_firework: "Flying over the evening [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was propelled through a fireworks display. The exploding rockets sparkled in all colors of the rainbow and the balloon did the same to the fireworks. Burning, it plummeted down and crashed. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the crash."

 curtiss_custom_death_redneck: "While flying over the rural region of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was hit by several bullets fired by a resident of the region out of joy. As a result, the balloon quickly lost gas and crashed to the ground. Along with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], the shooter of the bullets also died in the process."

 curtiss_custom_death_belltower: "During the landing approach, the balloon of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] drifted into the city. To avoid crashing into one of the houses, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] tried to regain altitude. Distracted by this, he didn't notice that he was heading straight for a tower. The balloon crashed into the tower and [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] was ejected from the balloon. In the process, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName]'s neck appears to have been broken."

 curtiss_custom_death_stork: "An unbelievable accident happened today in the sky above [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]! [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], the balloon of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], was hit by a stork or another bird. In any case, the bird's beak poked the balloon envelope. As the bird tried to extricate itself from the predicament, it tore an ever larger hole in the envelope, from which more and more gas escaped. The balloon then slumped to the ground and [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was killed on impact."

 curtiss_custom_death_balloon_duel: "In a dispute over the heart of a famous opera singer between our balloonist [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] and another balloonist, no agreement could be reached. it was decided the only way they could resolve the situation was with a balloon duel. So they boarded their balloons and began firing at each other. The heated firefight lasted almost an hour - probably because hitting a target from a flying balloon is not exactly easy. Finally, one bullet hit [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] and killed [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] floated away with the body and was only recovered hours later in open countryside."

 curtiss_custom_death_stray_bullet: "Somehow [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] got too close to the front line with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon. The enemy troops then started shooting at the balloon. The bullets missed the balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], but fatally hit [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The balloon continued to hover over the battlefield for a long time and eventually crashed on our side."

 curtiss_custom_death_power_line: "While landing with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] got too close to an electrical line. The balloon got caught in the wire, which both caused all the electricity to flow through [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s body and caused the balloon to burst into flames. It is not clear from what [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died, but it certainly was not pleasant."

 curtiss_custom_death_seagull: "While flying close to shore, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] got caught in a flock of seagulls that were targeting the fish that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] brought as provisions. Although the balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], was not damaged, one of the seagulls flew so hard into the head of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] lost consciousness and fell out of the balloon. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] succumbed to [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] injuries, while [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon floated away to the screeching of seagulls."

 curtiss_custom_death_lightning: "Ballooning in a thunderstorm may not be the best idea. ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had to learn that firsthand when [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was struck by lightning. The balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], burst into flames and crashed as a result. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the crash."

 curtiss_custom_death_sabotage: "What was supposed to be a normal flight quickly turned into a nightmare. In mid-flight, several of the balloon's ropes snapped, causing the basket of the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]  to crash and shatter on the ground. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the process. Upon examination of the wreckage, cut marks were noted on the ropes. Obviously it is a case of sabotage. It is not yet clear who is responsible for this."

 curtiss_custom_death_updraft: "During a balloon flight, the balloon of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], was caught by a very strong updraft. The balloon rose and rose. As the altitude increased, breathing became more difficult and the temperature became colder. It is not clear if [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] suffocated or froze to death, but his life came to an end at this extreme altitude."

 curtiss_custom_death_stampede: "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has landed in a pasture on one of his balloon flights. While folding the balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], he must have startled the horses. The tracks indicate that the animals ran off in all directions, several of them ramming and eventually trampling  [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] to death."

 curtiss_custom_death_failed_fixing: "While still at low altitude, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] noticed a problem with the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. Gas leaked from the side and the balloon slightly lost altitude. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] decided to fix the problem in flight and climbed onto the balloon envelope. As some witnesses reported, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] lost his footing and crashed to the ground where [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was found dead. The balloon floated to the ground some time later after enough gas had escaped."

 curtiss_custom_death_weak_spot: "Today [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] fell out of the sky and died on impact. At first it was unclear what had happened, but a little later the wreckage of the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was found. There was a large hole in the basket, indicating that the basket was poorly made and broke under the weight of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The death of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] is a great loss to our nation."

curtiss_custom_death_heart_attack: "The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] crashed today. The body of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was recovered from the wreckage. The cause of the accident was difficult to find. At first, it was suspected that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] intentionally operated the exhaust valve as air had flowed out of the envelope. Sometime later, a doctor found that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had already died before the crash. It seems that he suffered a heart attack in the air. This caused his muscles to cramp, which activated the valve."

 curtiss_custom_death_balloon_crash: "An unbelievable accident happened today in the sky above [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. As incredible as it may sound, two balloons collided with each other in the air. The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was damaged and lost altitude rapidly. It bounced on the ground, resulting in the death of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The other balloon was able to land, but the balloonist was completely devastated by the accident and tried to help [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. Unfortunately, all efforts were in vain."

 curtiss_custom_death_fighter_intercepted: "When our balloonist [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] accidentally flew over the border of our country, he was attacked by an unknown aircraft. The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was hit several times and rapidly lost altitude. Before the balloon even hit the ground, the aircraft attacked again and fatally hit [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The authorities of our neighboring country deny having anything to do with the attack."

 curtiss_custom_death_tornado: "Although a storm was raging over the Great Plains, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] decided to go up with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. The balloon was spun around in the air, but [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was undeterred and continued [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] flight. Unnoticed, a tornado formed behind [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim], pulling the balloon ever closer. Only just before the balloon was caught by the twister did [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] notice the danger. Unfortunately, it was too late. The body was not found until several days later, as it was buried under debris."

 curtiss_custom_death_fall: "It is unclear exactly how it happened, but [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] somehow fell out of the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] and died on impact. The balloon was found several days later after slowly floating back to the ground. No traces were found in the balloon that allowed conclusions to be drawn about what exactly happened to [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]."

 curtiss_custom_death_envelope_falls_apart: "Shortly after launch, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] crashed with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. At first glance, it appeared that the envelope had been shredded. But after closer examination, it was found that the seams of the envelope had come apart in the air. Thus, the balloon had fallen apart and crashed to the ground. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was unfortunately killed on impact."

 curtiss_custom_killed_by_indigenous_people: "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has landed with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] in the territory of the natives. These have never seen a balloon before and thought it was an evil demon. Before [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] could even show themselves, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was killed by bullets. One of our patrols found the body in the destroyed balloon a few days later."

 curtiss_custom_death_cigar: "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] crashed on [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] last flight. The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was burning brightly as it fell out of the sky. It seems that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] smoked a cigar during the flight and somehow ignited the basket. As a result, the balloon envelope started to burn as well, leading to the crash. In this case, smoking was definitely fatal."

 curtiss_custom_killed_crash_mountainside: "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] tried to overcome some mountains with the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. In the process, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] got caught in a snowstorm that made it impossible to see. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] tried to climb out of the blizzard but the balloon was caught by the strong winds and rammed into the rock face of a mountain. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was fatally injured in the crash and it was not until several days later that the body was recovered."

 curtiss_custom_death_hail_storm: "Everyone advised [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] against taking a balloon ride in such bad weather, but he insisted. As [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] went up in the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], the weather began to get more and more uncomfortable. Heavy rain first rushed down from the gloomy clouds, which shortly after turned into hail. Some of the hailstones were the size of a fist and tore the envelope of the balloon more and more. The balloon plummeted and crashed to the ground. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the crash."

 curtiss_custom_killed_alcohol: "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had drunk several bottles of wine before taking off with the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. Of course, alcohol doesn't help flying and being drunk makes ballooning even more dangerous. [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] died, however, not because he fell out of the balloon or accidentally ignited the balloon, no, it was the dropping of all ballast bags shortly after takeoff. The balloon shot up and disappeared in a flash. Only several days later the wreckage was found. [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was still in the basket, apparently dying of thirst after drinking a last bottle of wine."

 curtiss_custom_killed_opium: "The body of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was found in a field after [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] flew off with the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. At first it was unclear why [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] fell out of the balloon, but when the balloon also landed a few days later, opium was found inside. Apparently, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] consumed opium during the flight and then fell out of the balloon for unexplained reasons."

 curtiss_custom_death_acrobatics: "In front of a large crowd, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] tried to switch from one tethered balloon to a second balloon via a rope. At first it looked like he was going to make it with ease. But then he was caught by a strong gust of wind that threw him off the rope. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] fell into the middle of the crowd and died of his injuries on the spot."

 curtiss_custom_death_goose: "As with every flight, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] took a lucky goose on the balloon ride. The two flew away aboard the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. Hours later, the balloon landed successfully. Surprisingly, the balloon had only one passenger left. The Goose. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had disappeared. Even after days of searching, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] could not be found."

 curtiss_custom_death_mile_high_club: "The basket of the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] had been found in a field. In it lay [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] and a woman. Strangely, both were unclothed. There has been much speculation about the reasons for why. Most people assume that the two died of hypothermia and had removed their clothing shortly before. This is often the case with freezing to death, as a feeling of great heat suddenly appears. But there are also assumptions that the two did something... indecent."

 curtiss_custom_death_zoo_crocodile: "The flight was a complete success. Except for the landing... of all the places in the world, the zoo's crocodile enclosure was probably one of the worst places for a balloon to land. When the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] ended up in the middle of the water, the life of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was quickly over. Before anyone could intervene, the crocodiles went for the snack."

 curtiss_custom_death_cheap_parts: "Being thrifty is usually a virtue. But not when it comes to structural parts of a balloon.

# Balloon flight from Vauxhall Gardens to Weilburg
 curtiss.600.t: "Balloon flight from Vauxhall Gardens to Weilburg"
 curtiss.600.d: "Charles Green, an English balloonist set off with two crew members from Vauxhall Gardens in London in the Royal Vauxhall balloon. Thanks to good winds, the balloon crossed the English Channel and flew to Weilburg in Nassau, Germany. With a covered distance of about 500 miles or 800 kilometers, this is the longest balloon flight ever."
 curtiss.600.f: "The flight of the Royal Fauxhall held was an incredible success. The distance record was to stand for 80 years.\nThe flight was not without risks. Ballooning in the 19th century was especially dangerous because you never knew where you would land. Accordingly, Green took plenty of provisions with him on his journey. He also carried a ton of sand as ballast, a 1000-foot rope, barometers, telescopes, various alcoholic beverages, coats and all sorts of other things. Besides all the luggage, Green and his two companions, Thomas Monck Mason and Robert Hollond had to squeeze into the gondola.\nOnce they arrived in Weilburg, with the help of local people - and using the brandy they had brought with them - the balloon was freed of its contents and prepared for the return journey. In Weilburg, the three were warmly welcomed - including by the Prince of Nassau. They had to make the return journey by carriage, as no coal gas was available for the balloon."
 curtiss.600.g: "Another record for Great Britain!"

# Invention of the Rip Panel
 curtiss.601.t: "Invention of the Rip Panel"
 curtiss.601.d: "Balloon enthusiast and inventor John Wise has unveiled his latest invention to make ballooning much safer. The rip panel is a piece of the balloon envelope that is only lightly attached to the balloon. When the balloon lands, the piece can be torn off. This allows the gas in the balloon to escape at lightning speed. This prevents the balloon from dragging on the ground, getting caught somewhere or crashing into something."
 curtiss.601.f: "Before the invention of the rip panel, balloonists had to either secure their balloon with anchors or climb on top of the balloon and open a valve there to let the air escape from the balloon. This was extremely dangerous because the gas escapes quickly and the balloon collapses. It happened again and again that the balloonists got caught in the hull and died there. The invention of the rip panel on April 27, 1839, made ballooning much safer."
 curtiss.601.g: "Great work! Hopefully we will hear of this guy again!"

# First crossing of the Alps in a balloon by Francisque Arban
 curtiss.602.t: "First crossing of the Alps in a balloon by Francisque Arban"
 curtiss.602.d: "French balloonist Francisque Arban was the first person to cross the Alps in a hydrogen balloon. On the evening of September 2, 1849, he took off from Marseille and flew eastward. To cross the Cottian Alps, his balloon ascended to an altitude of about 15,000 feet or 4600 meters. The next morning he landed near Turin at half past two in the morning."
 curtiss.602.f: "The crossing of the Alps was a record that remained unbroken for a long time. It was not until 1924 that it was achieved again.\nArban had already gained experience in ballooning before his crossing of the Alps. He made his first attempts at the age of 17 around 1832, but he made most of his balloon flights in 1845 and 1849 in Italy. In 1846, he had to be rescued from the sea by fishermen after going off course near Trieste."

 curtiss.603.d: "Just one month after crossing the Alps in a balloon, Francisque Arban has disappeared. After taking off from Barcelona, he was blown away by the wind towards the Mediterranean Sea. Since then, there has been no trace of him. Should we send rescue teams to find Arban?"
 curtiss.603.f: "Historically, Francisque Arban's balloon was floated over the open sea on Oct. 7, 1849. Since then, there has been no trace of him. Presumably, he died on this balloon flight. What exactly happened, however, is unknown."
 curtiss.603.g: "Terrible! Send out ships immediately to search for him!"

Fortunately, Arban had the presence of mind to keep dropping things from his balloon that were floating on the surface of the water. One of our ships found the trail and followed it. Arban had held on for several days to his basket, which he had freed from the fabric of the balloon. Thanks to some supplies in the balloon, he had survived the ordeal."
 curtiss.604.d2: "A fishing boat has found Francisque Arban's balloon off the coast of Barcelona. He is doing well considering the circumstances, but he is severely dehydrated. Hopefully he will be better soon!"

 curtiss.605.f: "Historically, there were indeed articles in various newspapers in 1853 claiming that Arban had been enslaved in Africa. However, there was no evidence of this. It is unclear exactly what happened to Arban, but it is most likely that he drowned in the Mediterranean."

 curtiss.609.f: "Nadar took his first aerial photographs in 1859 at the Battle of Solferino. In 1963, Nadar became president of the #b Société d'encouragement pour la locomotion aérienne au moyen d'appareils plus lourds que l'air#!, a society dedicated to aviation.

 curtiss.610.f: "\"Le Géant\" was a 60 meter (196 ft) high balloon aptly named \"The Giant\". It was built by Eugène Godard and flown by Nadar. On only his second flight, Nadar crashed \"Le Géant\". Despite his own serious injuries and a badly damaged balloon, Nadar repaired \"Le Géant\" and flew with it again. In 1867 he took up to a dozen passengers on his balloon flights and served cold chicken and wine."

# Glaisher and Coxwell set record for highest balloon flight
 curtiss.611.t: "Glaisher and Coxwell set record for highest balloon flight"
 curtiss.611.d: "Meteorologist James Glaisher and balloonist Henry Tracey Coxwell have set a record for the highest balloon flight. They flew together in a balloon to an estimated height of 11,270 meters (37,000 feet). At an altitude of 8800 meters, Glaisher had already fallen unconscious. Coxwell could only get the balloon to sink with great difficulty. Fortunately, the two survived their adventure."
 curtiss.611.f: "In 1862, Glaisher and Coxwell ascended in the balloon \"Mammoth\". They had been commissioned by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to conduct experiments in the upper atmosphere. At an altitude of 8800 meters (29,000 feet), Glaisher fainted and Coxwell lost feeling in his hands. Because the valve line had become tangled, Coxwell could not get the balloon to sink from the basket. He had to climb onto the rigging and open the valve there with his teeth. He then fell unconscious, but the balloon began to sink. In 15 minutes, the balloon sank to the ground, where it landed safely."

 curtiss.612.f: "Eduard Spelterini, born Albert Schweizer, was trained as a balloonist in his youth. After he had his first own balloon built named \"Urania\", he traveled through Europe to show people from the upper class the world from above. Usually, a small picnic consisting of chops and champagne was included. Spelterini also started taking aerial photographs, but it was his passenger flights over the Alps that contributed most to his fame."
 curtiss.612.g: "An incredible view!"

# First flight of a steerable airship built by Giffard
 curtiss.613.t: "First flight of a steerable airship built by Giffard"
 curtiss.613.d: "A big problem of balloon flights is that they always depend on good winds. It is far too easy for the balloon to drift, which repeatedly leads to accidents. Henri Giffard tried to find a solution to this problem by constructing an elongated airship with a steam engine and rudder for steering. With his \"Giffard dirigible\", Giffard made a 27-kilometer flight from Paris to Élancourt. Since the airship is very slow, the flight against the wind is not possible so far. Who knows in which direction these airships will develop?"
 curtiss.613.f: "With his flight on September 24, 1852, Giffard succeeded in making the first flight with a powered and steerable airship. However, the propulsion by a steam engine was very weak, which meant that the airship did not yet become established. Later, with the invention of the internal combustion engine, the dream of airships could actually be realized."

The university promises large financial resources that would allow Piccard to use balloons to study the stratosphere even more thoroughly. Piccard seems eager to accept the offer. This would mean losing a great scientist who has extensive experience in ballooning as well."
 curtiss.614.f: "Piccard was appointed to the Free University of Brussels in 1922, where he devoted himself to stratospheric research using balloons in addition to teaching. In his stratospheric research, he also collaborated with his friend Albert Einstein, with whom he developed experiments.\nIn addition to his stratospheric research, Piccard invented a measuring device for radioactivity and a very precise seismograph. He also studied atomic physics and predicted a third uranium isotope, which was later discovered and is now known as uranium-235.\nIn Brussels, his lectures also made him the inspiration for the cartoon character Professor Calculus."
