# Balloon flight from Vauxhall Gardens to Weilburg
 curtiss.600.t:0 "Balloon flight from Vauxhall Gardens to Weilburg"
 curtiss.600.d:0 "Charles Green, an English balloonist set off with two crew members from Vauxhall Gardens in London in the Royal Vauxhall balloon. Thanks to good winds, the balloon crossed the English Channel and flew to Weilburg in Nassau, Germany. With a covered distance of about 500 miles or 800 kilometers, this is the longest balloon flight ever."
 curtiss.600.f:0 "The flight of the Royal Fauxhall held was an incredible success. The distance record was to stand for 80 years.\nThe flight was not without risks. Ballooning in the 19th century was especially dangerous because you never knew where you would land. Accordingly, Green took plenty of provisions with him on his journey. He also carried a ton of sand as ballast, a 1000-foot rope, barometers, telescopes, various alcoholic beverages, coats and all sorts of other things. Besides all the luggage, Green and his two companions, Thomas Monck Mason and Robert Hollond had to squeeze into the gondola.\nOnce they arrived in Weilburg, with the help of local people - and using the brandy they had brought with them - the balloon was freed of its contents and prepared for the return journey. In Weilburg, the three were warmly welcomed - including by the Prince of Nassau. They had to make the return journey by carriage, as no coal gas was available for the balloon."
 curtiss.600.g:0 "Another record for Great Britain!"

# Invention of the Rip Panel
 curtiss.601.t:0 "Invention of the Rip Panel"
 curtiss.601.d:0 "Balloon enthusiast and inventor John Wise has unveiled his latest invention to make ballooning much safer. The rip panel is a piece of the balloon envelope that is only lightly attached to the balloon. When the balloon lands, the piece can be torn off. This allows the gas in the balloon to escape at lightning speed. This prevents the balloon from dragging on the ground, getting caught somewhere or crashing into something."
 curtiss.601.f:0 "Before the invention of the rip panel, balloonists had to either secure their balloon with anchors or climb on top of the balloon and open a valve there to let the air escape from the balloon. This was extremely dangerous because the gas escapes quickly and the balloon collapses. It happened again and again that the balloonists got caught in the hull and died there. The invention of the rip panel on April 27, 1839, made ballooning much safer."
 curtiss.601.g:0 "Great work! Hopefully we will hear of this guy again!"

# First crossing of the Alps in a balloon by Francisque Arban
 curtiss.602.t:0 "First crossing of the Alps in a balloon by Francisque Arban"
 curtiss.602.d:0 "French balloonist Francisque Arban was the first person to cross the Alps in a hydrogen balloon. On the evening of September 2, 1849, he took off from Marseille and flew eastward. To cross the Cottian Alps, his balloon ascended to an altitude of about 15,000 feet or 4600 meters. The next morning he landed near Turin at half past two in the morning."
 curtiss.602.f:0 "The crossing of the Alps was a record that remained unbroken for a long time. It was not until 1924 that it was achieved again.\nArban had already gained experience in ballooning before his crossing of the Alps. He made his first attempts at the age of 17 around 1832, but he made most of his balloon flights in 1845 and 1849 in Italy. In 1846, he had to be rescued from the sea by fishermen after going off course near Trieste."
 curtiss.602.g:0 "Magnifique! A true hero of France!"


# Francisque Arban disappeared during a balloon flight over the Mediterranean Sea
 curtiss.603.t:0 "Francisque Arban disappeared during a balloon flight over the Mediterranean Sea"
 curtiss.603.d:0 "Just one month after crossing the Alps in a balloon, Francisque Arban has disappeared. After taking off from Barcelona, he was blown away by the wind towards the Mediterranean Sea. Since then, there has been no trace of him. Should we send rescue teams to find Arban?"
 curtiss.603.f:0 "Historically, Francisque Arban's balloon was floated over the open sea on Oct. 7, 1849. Since then, there has been no trace of him. Presumably, he died on this balloon flight. What exactly happened, however, is unknown."
 curtiss.603.g:0 "Terrible! Send out ships immediately to search for him!"
 curtiss.603.h:0 "He was aware of the risk. There is nothing we can do."

# Francisque Arban saved
 curtiss.604.t:0 "Francisque Arban saved"
 curtiss.604.d1:0 "Our search was successful! Francisque Arban was found by one of our ships! Fortunately, Arban had the presence of mind to keep dropping things from his balloon that were floating on the surface of the water. One of our ships found the trail and followed it. Arban had held on for several days to his basket, which he had freed from the fabric of the balloon. Thanks to some supplies in the balloon, he had survived the ordeal."
 curtiss.604.d2:0 "A fishing boat has found Francisque Arban's balloon off the coast of Barcelona. He is doing well considering the circumstances, but he is severely dehydrated. Hopefully he will be better soon!"
 curtiss.604.f:0 "\"That was the most exciting balloon flight of my life! I hope I broke a record in the process!\""
 curtiss.604.g:0 "What luck! Welcome back Arban!"

# Extra: Arban enslaved in Africa!
 curtiss.605.t:0 "Extra: Arban enslaved in Africa!"
 curtiss.605.d:0 "Various Spanish newspapers report that Arban did not drown in the Mediterranean, but reached Africa with his balloon and was enslaved there. More and more letters reach us from citizens asking us to search for Arban and free him from slavery."
 curtiss.605.f:0 "Historically, there were indeed articles in various newspapers in 1853 claiming that Arban had been enslaved in Africa. However, there was no evidence of this. It is unclear exactly what happened to Arban, but it is most likely that he drowned in the Mediterranean."
 curtiss.605.g:0 "We have to find Arban!"
 curtiss.605.h:0 "These are implausible stories that no one should believe."

# Arban was enslaved in SCOPE
 curtiss.606.t:0 "Arban was enslaved in [SCOPE.sCountry('curtiss_arban_slaver_scope').GetName]"
 curtiss.606.d:0 "Our research has revealed that Arban is indeed still alive. He was found in [SCOPE.sCountry('curtiss_arban_slaver_scope').GetName], where he has to work as a slave in the fields. The owners have offered that we could buy him from them for an immense sum. Of course, we could also just free him by force."
 curtiss.606.f:0 "Historically, the newspaper reports have not been followed up. Accordingly, it is not clear whether Arban was not enslaved. But it is very unlikely."
 curtiss.606.g:0 "We will free him from slavery!"
 curtiss.606.h:0 "Let us just pay and get this over with..."

# Arban rescued from slavery
 curtiss.607.t:0 "Arban rescued from slavery and returned home"
 curtiss.607.d1:0 "A small squad was assigned to free Arban from captivity. After a brief skirmish, they were able to free Arban and several other Europeans and escaped on horseback. Before the [SCOPE.sCountry('curtiss_arban_slaver_scope').GetAdjective] authorities could react, they had already arrived on a ship that took them home. Due to his long captivity he is worn out and weak, but he was able to tell us about his adventurous balloon flight. His know-how will certainly help us."
 curtiss.607.d2:0 "Arban has returned home. Due to his long captivity he is worn out and weak, but he was able to tell us about his adventurous balloon flight. His know-how will certainly help us."
 curtiss.607.f:0 "\"I was blown away by the wind into the open sea. Since I was blown south, I decided to try to reach the Balearic Islands. But the wind was bad and so I was driven to the coast of North Africa, where I could land. Unfortunately, the inhabitants there were not very friendly. Has anyone else ever flown over the Mediterranean? Did I set a record?\""
 curtiss.607.g:0 "A successful rescue!"
 curtiss.607.h:0 "Welcome back Arban!"

# No traces of Arban
 curtiss.608.t:0 "No traces of Arban"
 curtiss.608.d:0 "After months of searching, we still have not found any trace of Arban. It seems that the stories about his enslavement in North Africa are fictitious. Francisque Arban is undoubtedly dead."
 curtiss.608.f:0 "\"French? Of course! We sell a lot of French. Which one do you want? All of them are strong, they were sailors!\""
 curtiss.608.g:0 "Cancel the search."

# Nadar takes first aerial photos from a balloon
 curtiss.609.t:0 "Nadar takes first aerial photos from a balloon"
 curtiss.609.d:0 "French photographer Nadar has combined his two passions, ballooning and photography. He has succeeded in taking photographs from the air. These show the world from above, as few people have seen it before."
 curtiss.609.f:0 "Nadar took his first aerial photographs in 1859 at the Battle of Solferino. In 1963, Nadar became president of the #b Société d'encouragement pour la locomotion aérienne au moyen d'appareils plus lourds que l'air#!, a society dedicated to aviation. The secretary of the Société was none other than Jules Verne, who was inspired by the balloons of Nadar to write his story \"#b Five weeks in a balloon#!\"."
 curtiss.609.g:0 "The world from above looks so different!"

# Nadar's "Le Géant" crashes in Hannover
 curtiss.610.t:0 "Nadar's \"Le Géant\" crashes in Hannover"
 curtiss.610.d:0 "After a nerve-racking and extremely difficult flight from Paris to Hanover, Nadar crashed his giant balloon \"Le Géant\" in a field in Hanover. He was seriously injured, as was his wife. Hopefully he will recover soon and will continue flying balloons!"
 curtiss.610.f:0 "\"Le Géant\" was a 60 meter (196 ft) high balloon aptly named \"The Giant\". It was built by Eugène Godard and flown by Nadar. On only his second flight, Nadar crashed \"Le Géant\". Despite his own serious injuries and a badly damaged balloon, Nadar repaired \"Le Géant\" and flew with it again. In 1867 he took up to a dozen passengers on his balloon flights and served cold chicken and wine."
 curtiss.610.g:0 "What a horrible accident!"

# Glaisher and Coxwell set record for highest balloon flight
 curtiss.611.t:0 "Glaisher and Coxwell set record for highest balloon flight"
 curtiss.611.d:0 "Meteorologist James Glaisher and balloonist Henry Tracey Coxwell have set a record for the highest balloon flight. They flew together in a balloon to an estimated height of 11,270 meters (37,000 feet). At an altitude of 8800 meters, Glaisher had already fallen unconscious. Coxwell could only get the balloon to sink with great difficulty. Fortunately, the two survived their adventure."
 curtiss.611.f:0 "In 1862, Glaisher and Coxwell ascended in the balloon \"Mammoth\". They had been commissioned by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to conduct experiments in the upper atmosphere. At an altitude of 8800 meters (29,000 feet), Glaisher fainted and Coxwell lost feeling in his hands. Because the valve line had become tangled, Coxwell could not get the balloon to sink from the basket. He had to climb onto the rigging and open the valve there with his teeth. He then fell unconscious, but the balloon began to sink. In 15 minutes, the balloon sank to the ground, where it landed safely."
 curtiss.611.g:0 "They are lucky to have survived!"

# Eduard Spelterini transports passengers across the Alps
 curtiss.612.t:0 "Eduard Spelterini transports passengers across the Alps"
 curtiss.612.d:0 "During a flight with passengers, the Swiss Eduard Spelterini flew passengers over the Alps. In the process, he crossed some of the highest points in the Alps. Spelterini is now a star of ballooning."
 curtiss.612.f:0 "Eduard Spelterini, born Albert Schweizer, was trained as a balloonist in his youth. After he had his first own balloon built named \"Urania\", he traveled through Europe to show people from the upper class the world from above. Usually, a small picnic consisting of chops and champagne was included. Spelterini also started taking aerial photographs, but it was his passenger flights over the Alps that contributed most to his fame."
 curtiss.612.g:0 "An incredible view!"

# First flight of a steerable airship built by Giffard
 curtiss.613.t:0 "First flight of a steerable airship built by Giffard"
 curtiss.613.d:0 "A big problem of balloon flights is that they always depend on good winds. It is far too easy for the balloon to drift, which repeatedly leads to accidents. Henri Giffard tried to find a solution to this problem by constructing an elongated airship with a steam engine and rudder for steering. With his \"Giffard dirigible\", Giffard made a 27-kilometer flight from Paris to Élancourt. Since the airship is very slow, the flight against the wind is not possible so far. Who knows in which direction these airships will develop?"
 curtiss.613.f:0 "With his flight on September 24, 1852, Giffard succeeded in making the first flight with a powered and steerable airship. However, the propulsion by a steam engine was very weak, which meant that the airship did not yet become established. Later, with the invention of the internal combustion engine, the dream of airships could actually be realized."
 curtiss.613.g:0 "Maybe those steerable balloons will soon conquer the skies!"
