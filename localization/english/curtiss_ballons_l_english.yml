###Custom Balloonist Altitude Flights###

With as little weight as possible, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] climbed into the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. The ascent was rapid. Soon [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] could barely make out the people below. The panorama was breathtaking. Despite the rather high altitude, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] was still far from cloud cover. When the barometer read #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_altitude_var').GetValue]#! meters, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] first measured various values with the meteorological equipment before [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] opened a valve and slowly floated back down to earth."

 curtiss_altitude_under_9000_custom_1:0 "The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] shot up into the air. It had to be light, because [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had made it his goal to fly as high as possible. At first, the houses got smaller and smaller until they were just little dots. Then the balloon floated into the clouds, it felt like fog and small water droplets began to collect on the meteorological equipment. Gradually, it was getting colder. Fortunately, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] had dressed warmly. Slowly, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] felt himself struggling to breathe more and more.\nAt an altitude of #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_altitude_var').GetValue]#! meters, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] began the necessary measurements. Then the long descent began."

[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] head was pounding. A glance at the barometer revealed that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was now higher than any mountain in the world. People could only get this high if they flew. Meanwhile, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] body was starting to shake. The clothes were soaked from the clouds and the temperature was already well into the minus range.\nSo [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] fell to [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] knees. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] could only loosen the valve to initiate the descent with difficulty. Then [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] passed out.\nOnce on the ground, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] regained consciousness. More specifically, in a warm bed. Fortunately, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had been found."

 curtiss_altitude_under_12000_tools_custom_1:0 "Even with the air bottle, it was not easy. The cold spread through the body of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The air was freezing and it was hard to stand. But the data at this altitude was important. Therefore, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] started taking measurements. The barometer indicated an altitude of #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_altitude_var').GetValue]#! meters. Higher than any mountain in the world. Unfortunately, hardly anything was visible from up here. Dense clouds blocked the view.\n When the measurements were done, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] started releasing air from the envelope of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')].

With difficulty, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] pulled [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]self up by one of the ropes. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had to reach the valve. So close. Things were slowly getting dark. With [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] teeth, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] enclosed the valve. Started to turn it. Then [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] lost consciousness.\nSo warm. Where was [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe]. Shadows flitted by in front of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]. Slowly, they became people. A woman handed [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim] a bowl of soup. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had apparently survived."

 curtiss_altitude_under_16000_tools_custom_1:0 "The air bottle helped against the thin air. But the cold penetrated through the thick clothes. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was shivering. But it seemed like [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] made it as high as the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] would allow. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] began taking measurements for the scientific society. The barometer showed #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_altitude_var').GetValue]#! meters. An incredible altitude. Unfortunately, the view was not very good because of the clouds.\nAfter [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] finished taking measurements, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] began to let the air out of the envelope.

 curtiss_altitude_over_16000_custom_1:0 "It was relatively warm in the pressure chamber. The temperature outside, however, was unbearable. Good thing that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was sitting in the chamber and not outside. Breathing was also easy here. From the window [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] looked at the globe. From up here, the curvature of the earth was clearly visible. Towards the top, the blue of the sky became more and more black. Clouds were moving over the earth. From up here they looked like cotton candy. When the barometer read #p [ROOT.Var('new_balloon_altitude_var').GetValue]#! meters, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] opened a valve from the protection of the pressure chamber, causing the balloon to slowly float back to earth."

###Custom Balloonist Deaths###
 curtiss_custom_death_sea:0 "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has made a new record flight attempt. In the process, he went off course and drifted out to sea. Every attempt to retrieve [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim] was unsuccessful. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] probably drowned in the sea."

At an altitude of about 900 meters, the accident happened. Somehow the hydrogen gas in the balloon ignited. In no time at all, the whole envelope burned and the gondola crashed to the ground. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was killed on impact."

 curtiss_custom_death_firework:0 "Flying over the evening [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was propelled through a fireworks display. The exploding rockets sparkled in all colors of the rainbow and the balloon did the same to the fireworks. Burning, it plummeted down and crashed. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the crash."

 curtiss_custom_death_redneck:0 "While flying over the rural region of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was hit by several bullets fired by a resident of the region out of joy. As a result, the balloon quickly lost gas and crashed to the ground. Along with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], the shooter of the bullets also died in the process."

 curtiss_custom_death_comet:0 "During a balloon flight, the balloon of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was hit by a comet, which tore a hole in the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] and ignited the escaping gas. The balloon, ablaze with flames, then plummeted and smashed to the ground. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the crash. No one would have thought such a strange accident possible!"

 curtiss_custom_death_stork:0 "An unbelievable accident happened today in the sky above [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]! [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], the balloon of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], was hit by a stork or another bird. In any case, the bird's beak poked the balloon envelope. As the bird tried to extricate itself from the predicament, it tore an ever larger hole in the envelope, from which more and more gas escaped. The balloon then slumped to the ground and [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was killed on impact."

 curtiss_custom_death_balloon_duel:0 "In a dispute over the heart of a famous opera singer between our balloonist [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] and another balloonist, no agreement could be reached. it was decided the only way they could resolve the situation was with a balloon duel. So they boarded their balloons and began firing at each other. The heated firefight lasted almost an hour - probably because hitting a target from a flying balloon is not exactly easy. Finally, one bullet hit [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] and killed [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] floated away with the body and was only recovered hours later in open countryside."

 curtiss_custom_death_stray_bullet:0 "Somehow [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] got too close to the front line with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon. The enemy troops then started shooting at the balloon. The bullets missed the balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], but fatally hit [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The balloon continued to hover over the battlefield for a long time and eventually crashed on our side."

 curtiss_custom_death_power_line:0 "While landing with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] got too close to an electrical line. The balloon got caught in the wire, which both caused all the electricity to flow through [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s body and caused the balloon to burst into flames. It is not clear from what [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died, but it certainly was not pleasant."

 curtiss_custom_death_seagull:0 "While flying close to shore, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] got caught in a flock of seagulls that were targeting the fish that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] brought as provisions. Although the balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], was not damaged, one of the seagulls flew so hard into the head of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] lost consciousness and fell out of the balloon. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] succumbed to [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] injuries, while [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon floated away to the screeching of seagulls."

 curtiss_custom_death_lightning:0 "Ballooning in a thunderstorm may not be the best idea. ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had to learn that firsthand when [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was struck by lightning. The balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], burst into flames and crashed as a result. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the crash."

 curtiss_custom_death_sabotage:0 "What was supposed to be a normal flight quickly turned into a nightmare. In mid-flight, several of the balloon's ropes snapped, causing the basket of the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]  to crash and shatter on the ground. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the process. Upon examination of the wreckage, cut marks were noted on the ropes. Obviously it is a case of sabotage. It is not yet clear who is responsible for this."

 curtiss_custom_death_updraft:0 "During a balloon flight, the balloon of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], was caught by a very strong updraft. The balloon rose and rose. As the altitude increased, breathing became more difficult and the temperature became colder. It is not clear if [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] suffocated or froze to death, but his life came to an end at this extreme altitude."

 curtiss_custom_death_stampede:0 "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has landed in a pasture on one of his balloon flights. While folding the balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], he must have startled the horses. The tracks indicate that the animals ran off in all directions, several of them ramming and eventually trampling  [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] to death."

 curtiss_custom_death_failed_fixing:0 "While still at low altitude, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] noticed a problem with the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. Gas leaked from the side and the balloon slightly lost altitude. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] decided to fix the problem in flight and climbed onto the balloon envelope. As some witnesses reported, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] lost his footing and crashed to the ground where [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was found dead. The balloon floated to the ground some time later after enough gas had escaped."

 curtiss_custom_death_weak_spot:0 "Today [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] fell out of the sky and died on impact. At first it was unclear what had happened, but a little later the wreckage of the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was found. There was a large hole in the basket, indicating that the basket was poorly made and broke under the weight of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The death of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] is a great loss to our nation."

curtiss_custom_death_heart_attack:0 "The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] crashed today. The body of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was recovered from the wreckage. The cause of the accident was difficult to find. At first, it was suspected that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] intentionally operated the exhaust valve as air had flowed out of the envelope. Sometime later, a doctor found that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had already died before the crash. It seems that he suffered a heart attack in the air. This caused his muscles to cramp, which activated the valve."

 curtiss_custom_death_balloon_crash:0 "An unbelievable accident happened today in the sky above [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. As incredible as it may sound, two balloons collided with each other in the air.

 curtiss.600.d:0 "Charles Green, an English balloonist set off with two crew members from Vauxhall Gardens in London in the Royal Vauxhall balloon. Thanks to good winds, the balloon crossed the English Channel and flew to Weilburg in Nassau, Germany. With a covered distance of about 500 miles or 800 kilometers, this is the longest balloon flight ever."
 curtiss.600.f:0 "The flight of the Royal Fauxhall held was an incredible success. The distance record was to stand for 80 years.\nThe flight was not without risks. Ballooning in the 19th century was especially dangerous because you never knew where you would land. Accordingly, Green took plenty of provisions with him on his journey. He also carried a ton of sand as ballast, a 1000-foot rope, barometers, telescopes, various alcoholic beverages, coats and all sorts of other things. Besides all the luggage, Green and his two companions, Thomas Monck Mason and Robert Hollond had to squeeze into the gondola.\nOnce they arrived in Weilburg, with the help of local people - and using the brandy they had brought with them - the balloon was freed of its contents and prepared for the return journey. In Weilburg, the three were warmly welcomed - including by the Prince of Nassau. They had to make the return journey by carriage, as no coal gas was available for the balloon."

# Invention of the Rip Panel
 curtiss.601.t:0 "Invention of the Rip Panel"
 curtiss.601.d:0 "Balloon enthusiast and inventor John Wise has unveiled his latest invention to make ballooning much safer. The rip panel is a piece of the balloon envelope that is only lightly attached to the balloon. When the balloon lands, the piece can be torn off. This allows the gas in the balloon to escape at lightning speed. This prevents the balloon from dragging on the ground, getting caught somewhere or crashing into something."
 curtiss.601.f:0 "Before the invention of the rip panel, balloonists had to either secure their balloon with anchors or climb on top of the balloon and open a valve there to let the air escape from the balloon. This was extremely dangerous because the gas escapes quickly and the balloon collapses. It happened again and again that the balloonists got caught in the hull and died there. The invention of the rip panel on April 27, 1839, made ballooning much safer."
