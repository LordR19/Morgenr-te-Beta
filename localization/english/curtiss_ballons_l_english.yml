###Custom Balloonist Deaths###
 curtiss_custom_death_sea:0 "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has made a new record flight attempt. In the process, he went off course and drifted out to sea. Every attempt to retrieve [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim] was unsuccessful. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] probably drowned in the sea."

 curtiss_custom_death_hydrogen_ignition:0 "When the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] ascended to lofty heights, no one expected it to be [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s last ride. At an altitude of about 900 meters, the accident happened. Somehow the hydrogen gas in the balloon ignited. In no time at all, the whole envelope burned and the gondola crashed to the ground. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was killed on impact."

 curtiss_custom_death_firework:0 "Flying over the evening [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was propelled through a fireworks display. The exploding rockets sparkled in all colors of the rainbow and the balloon did the same to the fireworks. Burning, it plummeted down and crashed. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the crash."

 curtiss_custom_death_redneck:0 "While flying over the rural region of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was hit by several bullets fired by a resident of the region out of joy. As a result, the balloon quickly lost gas and crashed to the ground. Along with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], the shooter of the bullets also died in the process."

 curtiss_custom_death_comet:0 "During a balloon flight, the balloon of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was hit by a comet, which tore a hole in the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] and ignited the escaping gas. The balloon, ablaze with flames, then plummeted and smashed to the ground. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the crash. No one would have thought such a strange accident possible!"

 curtiss_custom_death_stork:0 "An unbelievable accident happened today in the sky above [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]! [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], the balloon of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], was hit by a stork or another bird. In any case, the bird's beak poked the balloon envelope. As the bird tried to extricate itself from the predicament, it tore an ever larger hole in the envelope, from which more and more gas escaped. The balloon then slumped to the ground and [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was killed on impact."

 curtiss_custom_death_balloon_duel:0 "In a dispute over the heart of a famous opera singer between our balloonist [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] and another balloonist, no agreement could be reached. it was decided the only way they could resolve the situation was with a balloon duel. So they boarded their balloons and began firing at each other. The heated firefight lasted almost an hour - probably because hitting a target from a flying balloon is not exactly easy. Finally, one bullet hit [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] and killed [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] floated away with the body and was only recovered hours later in open countryside."

 curtiss_custom_death_stray_bullet:0 "Somehow [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] got too close to the front line with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon. The enemy troops then started shooting at the balloon. The bullets missed the balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], but fatally hit [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The balloon continued to hover over the battlefield for a long time and eventually crashed on our side."

 curtiss_custom_death_power_line:0 "While landing with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] got too close to an electrical line. The balloon got caught in the wire, which both caused all the electricity to flow through [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s body and caused the balloon to burst into flames. It is not clear from what [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died, but it certainly was not pleasant."

 curtiss_custom_death_seagull:0 "While flying close to shore, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] got caught in a flock of seagulls that were targeting the fish that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] brought as provisions. Although the balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], was not damaged, one of the seagulls flew so hard into the head of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] lost consciousness and fell out of the balloon. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] succumbed to [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] injuries, while [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon floated away to the screeching of seagulls."

 curtiss_custom_death_lightning:0 "Ballooning in a thunderstorm may not be the best idea. ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had to learn that firsthand when [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was struck by lightning. The balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], burst into flames and crashed as a result. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the crash."

 curtiss_custom_death_sabotage:0 "What was supposed to be a normal flight quickly turned into a nightmare. In mid-flight, several of the balloon's ropes snapped, causing the basket of the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]  to crash and shatter on the ground. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] died in the process. Upon examination of the wreckage, cut marks were noted on the ropes. Obviously it is a case of sabotage. It is not yet clear who is responsible for this."

 curtiss_custom_death_updraft:0 "During a balloon flight, the balloon of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], was caught by a very strong updraft. The balloon rose and rose. As the altitude increased, breathing became more difficult and the temperature became colder. It is not clear if [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] suffocated or froze to death, but his life came to an end at this extreme altitude."

 curtiss_custom_death_stampede:0 "[ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has landed in a pasture on one of his balloon flights. While folding the balloon, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')], he must have startled the horses. The tracks indicate that the animals ran off in all directions, several of them ramming and eventually trampling  [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] to death."

 curtiss_custom_death_failed_fixing:0 "While still at low altitude, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] noticed a problem with the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. Gas leaked from the side and the balloon slightly lost altitude. [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] decided to fix the problem in flight and climbed onto the balloon envelope. As some witnesses reported, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] lost his footing and crashed to the ground where [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was found dead. The balloon floated to the ground some time later after enough gas had escaped."

 curtiss_custom_death_weak_spot:0 "Today [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] fell out of the sky and died on impact. At first it was unclear what had happened, but a little later the wreckage of the balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was found. There was a large hole in the basket, indicating that the basket was poorly made and broke under the weight of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The death of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] is a great loss to our nation."

curtiss_custom_death_heart_attack:0 "The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] crashed today. The body of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was recovered from the wreckage. The cause of the accident was difficult to find. At first, it was suspected that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] intentionally operated the exhaust valve as air had flowed out of the envelope. Sometime later, a doctor found that [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had already died before the crash. It seems that he suffered a heart attack in the air. This caused his muscles to cramp, which activated the valve."

 curtiss_custom_death_balloon_crash:0 "An unbelievable accident happened today in the sky above [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. As incredible as it may sound, two balloons collided with each other in the air. The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was damaged and lost altitude rapidly. It bounced on the ground, resulting in the death of [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The other balloon was able to land, but the balloonist was completely devastated by the accident and tried to help [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. Unfortunately, all efforts were in vain."

 curtiss_custom_death_fighter_intercepted:0 "When our balloonist [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] accidentally flew over the border of our country, he was attacked by an unknown aircraft. The balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')] was hit several times and rapidly lost altitude. Before the balloon even hit the ground, the aircraft attacked again and fatally hit [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. The authorities of our neighboring country deny having anything to do with the attack."

 curtiss_custom_death_tornado:0 "Although a storm was raging over the Great Plains, [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] decided to go up with [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] balloon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('curtiss_balloon_type')]. The balloon was spun around in the air, but [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was undeterred and continued [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] flight. Unnoticed, a tornado formed behind [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim], pulling the balloon ever closer. Only just before the balloon was caught by the twister did [ROOT.Var('curtiss_balloonist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] notice the danger. Unfortunately, it was too late. The body was not found until several days later, as it was buried under debris."



# Balloon flight from Vauxhall Gardens to Weilburg
 curtiss.600.t:0 "Balloon flight from Vauxhall Gardens to Weilburg"
 curtiss.600.d:0 "Charles Green, an English balloonist set off with two crew members from Vauxhall Gardens in London in the Royal Vauxhall balloon. Thanks to good winds, the balloon crossed the English Channel and flew to Weilburg in Nassau, Germany. With a covered distance of about 500 miles or 800 kilometers, this is the longest balloon flight ever."
 curtiss.600.f:0 "The flight of the Royal Fauxhall held was an incredible success. The distance record was to stand for 80 years.\nThe flight was not without risks. Ballooning in the 19th century was especially dangerous because you never knew where you would land. Accordingly, Green took plenty of provisions with him on his journey. He also carried a ton of sand as ballast, a 1000-foot rope, barometers, telescopes, various alcoholic beverages, coats and all sorts of other things. Besides all the luggage, Green and his two companions, Thomas Monck Mason and Robert Hollond had to squeeze into the gondola.\nOnce they arrived in Weilburg, with the help of local people - and using the brandy they had brought with them - the balloon was freed of its contents and prepared for the return journey. In Weilburg, the three were warmly welcomed - including by the Prince of Nassau. They had to make the return journey by carriage, as no coal gas was available for the balloon."
 curtiss.600.g:0 "Another record for Great Britain!"

# Invention of the Rip Panel
 curtiss.601.t:0 "Invention of the Rip Panel"
 curtiss.601.d:0 "Balloon enthusiast and inventor John Wise has unveiled his latest invention to make ballooning much safer. The rip panel is a piece of the balloon envelope that is only lightly attached to the balloon. When the balloon lands, the piece can be torn off. This allows the gas in the balloon to escape at lightning speed. This prevents the balloon from dragging on the ground, getting caught somewhere or crashing into something."
 curtiss.601.f:0 "Before the invention of the rip panel, balloonists had to either secure their balloon with anchors or climb on top of the balloon and open a valve there to let the air escape from the balloon. This was extremely dangerous because the gas escapes quickly and the balloon collapses. It happened again and again that the balloonists got caught in the hull and died there. The invention of the rip panel on April 27, 1839, made ballooning much safer."

# First crossing of the Alps in a balloon by Francisque Arban
 curtiss.602.t:0 "First crossing of the Alps in a balloon by Francisque Arban"
 curtiss.602.d:0 "French balloonist Francisque Arban was the first person to cross the Alps in a hydrogen balloon. On the evening of September 2, 1849, he took off from Marseille and flew eastward. To cross the Cottian Alps, his balloon ascended to an altitude of about 15,000 feet or 4600 meters. The next morning he landed near Turin at half past two in the morning."
 curtiss.602.f:0 "The crossing of the Alps was a record that remained unbroken for a long time. It was not until 1924 that it was achieved again.\nArban had already gained experience in ballooning before his crossing of the Alps. He made his first attempts at the age of 17 around 1832, but he made most of his balloon flights in 1845 and 1849 in Italy. In 1846, he had to be rescued from the sea by fishermen after going off course near Trieste."

 curtiss.603.f:0 "Historically, Francisque Arban's balloon was floated over the open sea on Oct. 7, 1849. Since then, there has been no trace of him. Presumably, he died on this balloon flight. What exactly happened, however, is unknown."

 curtiss.605.f:0 "Historically, there were indeed articles in various newspapers in 1853 claiming that Arban had been enslaved in Africa. However, there was no evidence of this. It is unclear exactly what happened to Arban, but it is most likely that he drowned in the Mediterranean."

In 1963, Nadar became president of the #b Société d'encouragement pour la locomotion aérienne au moyen d'appareils plus lourds que l'air#!, a society dedicated to aviation.

# Glaisher and Coxwell set record for highest balloon flight
 curtiss.611.t:0 "Glaisher and Coxwell set record for highest balloon flight"
 curtiss.611.d:0 "Meteorologist James Glaisher and balloonist Henry Tracey Coxwell have set a record for the highest balloon flight. They flew together in a balloon to an estimated height of 11,270 meters (37,000 feet). At an altitude of 8800 meters, Glaisher had already fallen unconscious. Coxwell could only get the balloon to sink with great difficulty. Fortunately, the two survived their adventure."
 curtiss.611.f:0 "In 1862, Glaisher and Coxwell ascended in the balloon \"Mammoth\". They had been commissioned by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to conduct experiments in the upper atmosphere. At an altitude of 8800 meters (29,000 feet), Glaisher fainted and Coxwell lost feeling in his hands. Because the valve line had become tangled, Coxwell could not get the balloon to sink from the basket. He had to climb onto the rigging and open the valve there with his teeth. He then fell unconscious, but the balloon began to sink. In 15 minutes, the balloon sank to the ground, where it landed safely."

After he had his first own balloon built named \"Urania\", he traveled through Europe to show people from the upper class the world from above. Usually, a small picnic consisting of chops and champagne was included. Spelterini also started taking aerial photographs, but it was his passenger flights over the Alps that contributed most to his fame."

# First flight of a steerable airship built by Giffard
 curtiss.613.t:0 "First flight of a steerable airship built by Giffard"
 curtiss.613.d:0 "A big problem of balloon flights is that they always depend on good winds. It is far too easy for the balloon to drift, which repeatedly leads to accidents. Henri Giffard tried to find a solution to this problem by constructing an elongated airship with a steam engine and rudder for steering. With his \"Giffard dirigible\", Giffard made a 27-kilometer flight from Paris to Élancourt. Since the airship is very slow, the flight against the wind is not possible so far. Who knows in which direction these airships will develop?"
 curtiss.613.f:0 "With his flight on September 24, 1852, Giffard succeeded in making the first flight with a powered and steerable airship. However, the propulsion by a steam engine was very weak, which meant that the airship did not yet become established. Later, with the invention of the internal combustion engine, the dream of airships could actually be realized."
