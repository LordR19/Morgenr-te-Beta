In 1860, Paul Reuter used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and Aachen, the terminus of early telegraph lines. During the Franco-Prussian War pigeons were used to carry mail between defeated Paris and the French unoccupied territory. In December 1870, it took ten hours for a pigeon carrying microfilms to fly from Perpignan to Brussels."

The manned captive balloons were let into the air on a rope in order to observe the enemy lines and pass the situation on to the own teams below."
 curtiss_early_aviation_tech: "Early Aviation"
 curtiss_early_aviation_tech_desc: "Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed heavier-than-air flight. He was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful gliding flights. Lilienthal's work led to him developing the concept of the modern wing, which heavily inspired further development. The American Wright brothers flights in 1903 are recognized as 'the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight'."

 curtiss_seaplanes_tech_desc: "On 28 March 1910, Frenchman Henri Fabre flew the first successful powered seaplane, the Gnome Omega-powered hydravion, a trimaran floatplane. Fabre's first successful take off and landing by a powered seaplane inspired other aviators. The first hydro-aeroplane competition was held in Monaco in March 1912, featuring aircraft using floats from Fabre, Curtiss, Tellier and Farman. The French Navy ordered its first floatplane in the same year."

During the Golden Age of Aviation it became widespread. Long-distance flights for the luxury traveller became possible for the first time; the early services used airships, but, after the Hindenburg disaster, airships fell out of use and the flying boat came to dominate."

After several years of preparatory work, the company succeeded in 1931 in using an airship for a purely scientific polar expedition for the first time. Through the Arctic flight of the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, knowledge of the geography of the polar regions flown over was significantly expanded. As early as 1926 Umberto Nobile flew over the North Pole with his airship 'Norge' and later undertook an expedition with the 'Italia'."

 je_curtiss_found_schneider_trophy: "Found the Schneider Trophy"
 je_curtiss_found_schneider_trophy_reason: "Jacques Schneider was a French industrial manager, licensed plane and balloon pilot, and, for a long time, held the balloon altitude record. Deprived of flying due to a serious accident, he supported various competitions and aero clubs financially. As race referee at the Monaco meeting in 1912, he noticed that seaplane design was lagging far behind other aircraft. Since seaplanes promised to be the best solution for long-range passenger service, Mr. Schneider thought that a seaplane race would allow these aircraft to improve more quickly."

The number of pilots, an ace pilot, an airplane focus, the invention of modern aviation, the number of airports and aircraft factories, successful training and government support are factors that give a considerable number of points before the race and thus make victory more likely. The size and success of an airline also plays a role. The remaining chance of victory is calculated in the race itself, with events awarding points.

 curtiss.10.d: "The age of seaplanes and flying boats not only revolutionizes traffic and opens up previously unknown possibilities, but also inspires the spirit that wants to break through the last barriers."
 curtiss.10.f: "The invention of the seaplane had unexpected advantages at the beginning of the 20th century. They could land in lakes, rivers, and harbors, allowing for landings both near urban centers and in unexplored wilderness - with no airport or runway. At the same time, the nations competed for new records in water sports aircraft races."

 curtiss.12.t: "Henri Fabre"
 curtiss.12.d: "Aviation pioneer Henri Fabre tested a seaplane in the Bay of Marseille today, marking a breakthrough in aviation."
 curtiss.12.f: "Henri Fabre was an engineer who studied the airplanes of Louis Blériot and Gabriel Voisin. He then decided in 1909 to start building the first prototype seaplane. Fabre invested a lot of time in the construction of the floats. This knowledge later helped him to equip foreign aircraft types with floats. However, the prototype only had a weak 18 kW (25 hp) engine and therefore did not fly. The next machine received a powerful 37 kW (50 hp) Gnôme radial engine. He named the plane 'Hydravion' (seaplane). On March 28, 1910, the launch attempts began over the Étang de Berre at Martigues near Marseille. The second launch was successful and the plane flew around 600 m. The next day it was even 6 km. The filigree Hydravion proved to be very stable. After a crash on landing, the plane was overhauled. In April 1911, the new version started with the pilot Jean Bécue in Monaco. Henri Fabre was soon contacted by Glenn Curtiss and Gabriel Voisin who used his invention to develop their own seaplanes. Fabre died at the Methuselah age of 101 in 1984 and was one of the last living aviation pioneers. As late as 1971, Fabre said he was still sailing his own boat single-handedly in Marseille harbour."

 curtiss.13.f: "In 1923, the first successful commercial flying-boat service was introduced, with flights to and from the Channel Islands. In 1928, four Supermarine Southampton flying boats of the RAF Far East flight arrived in Melbourne, Australia. The flight was considered proof that flying boats had become a reliable means of long-distance transport. n the 1930s, flying boats made it possible to have regular air transport between the U.S. and Europe, opening up new air travel routes to South America, Africa, and Asia. Foynes, Ireland and Botwood, Newfoundland and Labrador were the terminals for many early transatlantic flights. In areas where there were no airfields for land-based aircraft, flying boats could stop at small river, lake or coastal stations to refuel and resupply. The Pan Am Boeing 314 'Clipper' flying boats brought new exotic destinations like the Far East within reach and came to represent the romance of flight."

He occupied a prominent place in Italian literature from 1889 to 1910 and later political life from 1914 to 1924. He was often referred to under the epithets Il Vate ('the Poet'). D'Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French symbolism and British aestheticism. Such works represented a turn against the naturalism of the preceding romantics and was both sensuous and mystical. He came under the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche which would find outlets in his literary and later political contributions. During the First World War, perception of D'Annunzio in Italy transformed from literary figure into a national war hero.

 curtiss.51.f: "The first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun (helios). On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth. After an oil drilling operation in 1903 in Kansas produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas. With further analysis, Hamilton Cady and David McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas. Although the extraction process using low-temperature gas liquefaction was not developed in time to be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft."

 curtiss.54.f: "On August 13, 1898, Zeppelin obtained Reich patent number 98580 for a 'steerable aircraft with several support bodies arranged one behind the other'. The most important features of Zeppelin's design were the rigid aluminum frame made up of rings and longitudinal members, the firm connection of the two gondolas to the frame, the division of the gas space into cylindrical cells of equal size, and the attachment of propellers at the height of the air resistance centre. The airships were called zeppelins. Zeppelin's ideas continued to be largely rejected and ridiculed by experts and the general public; Kaiser Wilhelm II described the count as the 'stupidest of all southern Germans'. During this time, Zeppelin said: 'Of course nobody stands up for me, because nobody wants to take the leap into the dark. But my goal is clear and my calculations are correct'. In 1900, the LZ 1 made three ascents over Lake Constance, with Zeppelin's technical manager being the engineer Fritz Burr. The ever better results led to spontaneous enthusiasm among the population, which made a decisive contribution to the Count being able to further develop the technology of airships and their operation."

The race was significant in advancing aeroplane design, particularly in the fields of aerodynamics and engine design, and would show its results in the best fighters of World War II. The streamlined shape and the low drag, liquid-cooled engine pioneered by Schneider Trophy designs are obvious in the British Supermarine Spitfire, the American North American P-51 Mustang, and the Italian Macchi C.202 Folgore.

 curtiss.103.f: "The competition for the Schneider Trophy first began as a race between various pilots and their planes, with little government support. By the 1920s, however, the race had gained such publicity that hundreds of thousands attended the races. With that, the race and its importance had taken on a new dimension. When the USA and Italy officially supported their teams soon after, the competition mutated into a tournament of nations.

On the one hand, this is a big day for aviation; On the other hand, however, the melancholy thought remains that with the record-breaking development of aviation, the pioneering age of aviation is coming to an end in favor of an age of silver, in which no longer human ambition but pure mechanics dominate."
 curtiss.114.g: "Bitter. Very bitter."
 curtiss.121.t: "Mechanical problems"
 curtiss.121.d: "The Schneider Trophy was notorious for the fact that many pilots were not even able to take part in the competition because travel was already a problem. Some machines were damaged, others suffered from engine problems, the cause of which could not be remedied by the time the starting signal was given. Mechanical problems caused entire teams to drop out."
 curtiss.121.f: "There are isolated, completely negligible voices that claim that the Schneider Trophy was a complete failure. Because the ongoing engine problems, difficulties with the journey and the death of test pilots would have led to the fact that many teams could not compete - which led to a thinning out of the competition. France, the historical birthplace of the seaplane, could hardly participate in the race because of such problems. Countries like Great Britain or Italy won several times because they provided the only plane that could take part in the race at all."
 curtiss.121.g: "Bunglers!"
 curtiss.122.t: "Crash!"
 curtiss.122.d: "During a maneuver, our pilot overestimated himself - and crashed into the water!"
 curtiss.122.f: "Despite its challenges, the race for the Schneider Trophy has not resulted in a fatality or serious accident in the twenty years of its existence. However, this does not rule out the possibility that such a disaster could not have led to such a disaster given the high speeds and the aircraft construction, which was still in its pioneering days."
 curtiss.122.g: "Yikes!"
 curtiss.123.t: "Buoy overlooked"
 curtiss.123.d: "Our team flew a good lap in the Schneider Trophy race, but one of the pilots was threatened with a point deduction because one of the referees complained that he had overlooked a buoy."
 curtiss.123.f: "In 1919, the Italian team won in Bournemouth, UK, in foggy conditions. The referees at the Swanage bend asserted that Guido Janello, the winner of the race, did not round the buoy correctly. The former said that the error was due to bad organization and that a non-official boat had cheated him. However, Janello was disqualified and the Schneider Trophy was not awarded this year. Italy was later compensated for holding the next race in Venice. To this day, the memory of the disqualification causes great frustration among Italian aircraft nostalgics, because Italy also won in 1920 and 1921 and would have won the Schneider Trophy forever in retrospect."
 curtiss.123.g: "That's bad luck, of course."
 curtiss.123.h: "Try to bribe the referee ..."
 curtiss.124.t: "Maximum Speed"
 curtiss.124.d: "Along the route, our pilots can show what our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] machines are made of."
 curtiss.124.f: "The Schneider Trophy was primarily a high-speed race in which the latest aircraft technology and the personal achievement of the pilot played a prominent role. In order to achieve a good result, the latest technologies, the national focus on aircraft construction and the personal qualities of a pilot count. Ace pilots and Schneider Trophy veterans do better, but so do particularly daring or innovative characters."
 curtiss.124.g: "Full Power!"
 curtiss.125.t: "Slalom maneuvers"
 curtiss.125.d: "The Schneider Trophy is best known as a speed competition, but there were three to four marks that could be missed at high speed - and could result in disqualification."
 curtiss.125.f: "Most of the Schneider Trophy races took place on a triangular route, which is why turning maneuvers were rather rare. That's not to say they didn't play a part, though; one misstep has cost a pilot many a victory. In such a maneuver, the qualities of the pilot are crucial: experienced pilots, as well as cautious characters will achieve a better result than the overly impetuous ones. Training at the pilot school has an additional advantage."
 curtiss.125.g: "Fly with elegance."
 curtiss.126.t: "Fog"
 curtiss.126.d: "Fog was more often a problem on the waterways. Even experienced pilots could fail at this sudden challenge."
 curtiss.126.f: "Water races have the major disadvantage that fog presents an additional challenge. As with all manoeuvres, the characteristics of the pilot and his experience are the main factors here. Pilots with unorthodox methods can do better, as can cautious characters."
 curtiss.126.g: "Our pilot will find his way."

 curtiss.127.d: "The superior qualities of our pilot have significantly improved our chances of winning the Schneider Cup!"
 curtiss.127.f: "'Well, I have always been highly competitive, and that is useful no matter what sport you go into. And in those days flying was to a considerable degree a sport, yes.

 curtiss.134.d: "Pilots and spectators agree: this year's race for the Schneider Trophy is a very special one."
 curtiss.134.f: "Foreign dignitaries, society representatives, pilots and tourists congratulated the organizers of this year's race. The event is a complete success, the crowds are larger than usual and people will probably be raving about these days for years to come.

 curtiss.135.f: "Historically, no sabotage maneuvers against participating Schneider Trophy States have been proven. However, the frequent failures of the machines have given rise to rumors that these are not just mechanical problems. With a 50:50 chance we can try to damage a rival badly.

But since this morning the plane just won't start anymore. Some experts are of the opinion that the mechanical problems could be due to sabotage - although this cannot be proven. On the other hand, it is obvious that this damage will set us back weeks."

 curtiss.213.f: "There were concepts of having airships moored to skyscrapers. The top of the Empire State Building, which opened in 1931, was originally intended to serve as an anchor mast. The mast was so braced that it could have withstood the 50 ton pull from the airship mooring. Some of the winches were already installed and the 86th floor was prepared as a departure lounge with ticket counter and customs control. The idea corresponded to the euphoria of the time for the giants of the air. However, the construction did not take into account that airships can only be maneuvered very sluggishly and that wind turbulences always arise due to the development, which could have seriously disturbed an airship."

For example, at the request of Basil L. Rowe, the owner of West Indian Aerial Express, he carried some 3,000 pieces of special souvenir mail between Santo Domingo, Port-au-Prince, and Havana. Two weeks after his Latin American tour, Lindbergh piloted a series of special flights. Tens of thousands of self-addressed souvenir covers were sent in from all over the world.

They were hardly weatherproof and quickly fell into disrepair. Therefore, in the following years, the partial metal construction and finally the all-metal construction prevailed.

 curtiss.504.f: "In principle, a single-bladed propeller is the most efficient, since the inflow of the rotating propeller blade is least disturbed by the turbulence of the leading blade. However, it requires a counterweight, loads the drive shaft asymmetrically and vibrates relatively heavily, which is why this type of design is rarely used. A higher number of blades has a positive effect on the vibration behavior, especially if the individual blades are subjected to different flows over the propeller circle. On piston engine powered aircraft, two bladed propellers are most common. The turboprop and propfan engines of larger aircraft, on the other hand, have 3 to 7 or even more blades."

The company chairman Dr. Hugo Eckener commanded the delivery flight, and the ship was commissioned as the USS Los Angeles (ZR-3).

Accordingly, Zeppelin Lufftschiffbau began construction of the first of a new generation of airships, the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin. On 18 September 1928, the completed airship flew for the first time. During its career, Graf Zeppelin crossed the South Atlantic a total of 136 times."

It's practically standing still now; they've dropped ropes out of the nose of the ship, and it's been taken a hold of down on the field by a number of men. It's starting to rain again -- the rain had slacked up a little bit. The back motors of the ship are just holding it, just enough to keep it from --\nIt burst into flames! Get out of the way!

The zeppelin first flew from Friedrichshafen via Berlin and Leningrad to Franz-Josef-Land. In the Bayta Tichaya of Hooker Island there was a meeting with the Soviet icebreaker Malygin, where mail was exchanged to finance the operation. After briefly circling over Franz Josef Land, Eckener steered the airship east to the not yet fully charted Komsomolets Island and followed the west coast of Severnaya Zemlya to Cape Chelyuskin. Over the Byrranga mountains of the Taimyr peninsula we went back to the Kara Sea and the northern tip of Novaya Zemlya near Dikson. Following the southeast coast of the double island, the zeppelin returned to Friedrichshafen after flying over Arkhangelsk and Leningrad and stopping again in Berlin. LZ 127 had covered a total of about 10,600 kilometers. The trip demonstrated the excellent suitability of airships as a means of transport and research platform in the Arctic. It yielded a wealth of scientific results."

 curtiss.531.d_bio: "From the airship, researchers were able to observe a group of polar bears and study their behavior for days."
 curtiss.531.f_geo: "In the early days of polar exploration, one of the major concerns was the discovery of new passages, such as opening up the Northeast Passage and the Northwest Passage. Although both routes proved unprofitable because of the ice, maps of the polar region should not lose their usefulness in aiding later exploration."
 curtiss.531.f_meo: "Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky."
 curtiss.531.f_bio: "Constantine John Phipps was the first to describe the polar bear as a distinct species in 1774 in his report about his 1773 expedition towards the North Pole. It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice."

 curtiss.532.f_geo: "The possibility of flying over large parts of the Arctic in a zeppelin was a huge advantage compared to earlier shipping: there was simply no risk of the ship getting stuck in the ice. The overview also enabled completely new options for convenient mapping of the area."
 curtiss.532.f_meo: "Owing to motion of fluid in the Earth's outer core, the actual magnetic poles are constantly moving. However, over thousands of years, their direction averages to the Earth's rotation axis. On the order of once every half a million years, the poles reverse although the time frame of this switching can be anywhere from every 10 thousand years to every 50 million years. Although the geomagnetic pole is only theoretical and cannot be located directly, it arguably is of more practical relevance than the magnetic (dip) pole. This is because the poles describe a great deal about the Earth's magnetic field, determining for example where auroras can be observed."
 curtiss.532.f_bio: "Found primarily in Canadian Arctic and Greenlandic and Russian waters, the narwhal is a uniquely specialised Arctic predator. In winter, it feeds on benthic prey, mostly flatfish, under dense pack ice. During the summer, narwhals eat mostly Arctic cod and Greenland halibut, with other fish such as polar cod making up the remainder of their diet. The most conspicuous characteristic of the male narwhal is a single long tusk, which is in fact a canine tooth. Some medieval Europeans believed narwhal tusks to be the horns from the legendary unicorn."
