 curtiss_montgolfier_balloon_tech: "Montgolfier Balloons"
 curtiss_montgolfier_balloon_tech_desc: "Montgolfière is the name of the first hot air balloon, named after French inventors Joseph Michel and Jacques Etienne Montgolfier. Word of the 'aerostatic machines' quickly spread throughout Europe. The first military use of aircraft took place during the French Revolutionary Wars, when the French used a tethered hydrogen balloon to observe the movements of the Austrian army during the Battle of Fleurus (1794)."
 curtiss_messenger_pidgeons_tech: "Messenger Pidgeons"
 curtiss_messenger_pidgeons_tech_desc: "The pigeon post was rare until the 1820s. In 1860, Paul Reuter used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and Aachen, the terminus of early telegraph lines. During the Franco-Prussian War pigeons were used to carry mail between defeated Paris and the French unoccupied territory. In December 1870, it took ten hours for a pigeon carrying microfilms to fly from Perpignan to Brussels."
 curtiss_reconnaissance_balloon_tech: "Reconnaissance Balloons"
 curtiss_reconnaissance_balloon_tech_desc: "A reconnaissance balloon is a balloon filled with a gas mixture that is equipped with military reconnaissance technology. The balloon was used as an observation post during the American Civil War and the Franco-German War. The manned captive balloons were let into the air on a rope in order to observe the enemy lines and pass the situation on to the own teams below."
 curtiss_early_aviation_tech: "Early Aviation"
 curtiss_early_aviation_tech_desc: "Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed heavier-than-air flight. He was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful gliding flights. Lilienthal's work led to him developing the concept of the modern wing, which heavily inspired further development. The American Wright brothers flights in 1903 are recognized as 'the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight'."

 curtiss_seaplanes_tech_desc: "On 28 March 1910, Frenchman Henri Fabre flew the first successful powered seaplane, the Gnome Omega-powered hydravion, a trimaran floatplane. Fabre's first successful take off and landing by a powered seaplane inspired other aviators. The first hydro-aeroplane competition was held in Monaco in March 1912, featuring aircraft using floats from Fabre, Curtiss, Tellier and Farman. The French Navy ordered its first floatplane in the same year."

 curtiss_modern_aviation_tech_desc: "Civil aviation is one of two major categories of flying, representing all non-military and non-state aviation, both private and commercial. During the Golden Age of Aviation it became widespread. Long-distance flights for the luxury traveller became possible for the first time; the early services used airships, but, after the Hindenburg disaster, airships fell out of use and the flying boat came to dominate."

 je_curtiss_found_schneider_trophy: "Found the Schneider Trophy"
 je_curtiss_found_schneider_trophy_reason: "Jacques Schneider was a French industrial manager, licensed plane and balloon pilot, and, for a long time, held the balloon altitude record. Deprived of flying due to a serious accident, he supported various competitions and aero clubs financially. As race referee at the Monaco meeting in 1912, he noticed that seaplane design was lagging far behind other aircraft. Since seaplanes promised to be the best solution for long-range passenger service, Mr. Schneider thought that a seaplane race would allow these aircraft to improve more quickly."
 je_curtiss_found_schneider_trophy_goal: "At least #BLUE 5#! nations which have at least Major Power status and three ports have invented #E Seaplanes#!. Only #G [GetGlobalVariable('curtiss_seaplane_nations').GetValue]#! nations fulfill the requirements."
 je_curtiss_schneider_trophy_race: "Schneider Trophy Race"
 je_curtiss_schneider_trophy_race_reason: "The Schneider Trophy was a competition for the most advanced technology and the best pilots of its time. Even before the start of the actual race, the probability of victory is calculated. The number of pilots, an ace pilot, an airplane focus, the invention of modern aviation, the number of airports and aircraft factories, successful training and government support are factors that give a considerable number of points before the race and thus make victory more likely. The size and success of an airline also plays a role. The remaining chance of victory is calculated in the race itself, with events awarding points. The first nation to collect 30 Schneider Trophy points has the best chance of victory."
 je_curtiss_schneider_trophy_race_goal: "Our team wins if it reaches #BLUE 60#! Schneider Trophy points first. We currently have #G [ROOT.Var('schneider_trophy_point').GetValue]#! points."

 je_curtiss_spruce_goose_plan: "Hercules of the Sky"
 je_curtiss_spruce_goose_plan_reason: "The sky is the last limit. What was once the age of discovery in the early modern period is now the conquest of the skies. But compared to the galleons of the Spaniards, today's celestial vessels are mere nutshells. Ocean giants sail the seas today, but the skies have so far only been dominated by small machines.

 je_curtiss_lindbergh_generic: "The Orteig Prize"
 je_curtiss_lindbergh_generic_reason: "The Orteig Prize was a reward offered to the first aviator(s) to fly non-stop from New York City to Paris or vice versa. Several famous aviators made unsuccessful attempts at the New York-Paris flight before the relatively unknown American Charles Lindbergh won the prize in 1927 in his aircraft Spirit of St. Louis. However, a number of people died who were competing to win the prize. Six men died in three separate crashes, and another three were injured in a fourth crash. The Prize occasioned considerable investment in aviation, sometimes many times the value of the prize itself, and advancing public interest and the level of aviation technology. It was first offered in 1919 by New York hotel owner Raymond Orteig. On offer for five years, the goal of the prize seemed beyond the capacity of aircraft of the time and the prize attracted no competitors. After its original term had expired Orteig reissued the prize on June 1, 1925 by depositing $25,000 in negotiable securities at the Bryant Bank with the awarding put under the control of a seven-member board of trustees."

 curtiss.10.t: "Ruler of Air and Water"
 curtiss.10.d: "The age of seaplanes and flying boats not only revolutionizes traffic and opens up previously unknown possibilities, but also inspires the spirit that wants to break through the last barriers."
 curtiss.10.f: "The invention of the seaplane had unexpected advantages at the beginning of the 20th century. They could land in lakes, rivers, and harbors, allowing for landings both near urban centers and in unexplored wilderness - with no airport or runway. At the same time, the nations competed for new records in water sports aircraft races."

 curtiss.12.t: "Henri Fabre"
 curtiss.12.d: "Aviation pioneer Henri Fabre tested a seaplane in the Bay of Marseille today, marking a breakthrough in aviation."
 curtiss.12.f: "Henri Fabre was an engineer who studied the airplanes of Louis Blériot and Gabriel Voisin. He then decided in 1909 to start building the first prototype seaplane. Fabre invested a lot of time in the construction of the floats. This knowledge later helped him to equip foreign aircraft types with floats. However, the prototype only had a weak 18 kW (25 hp) engine and therefore did not fly. The next machine received a powerful 37 kW (50 hp) Gnôme radial engine. He named the plane 'Hydravion' (seaplane). On March 28, 1910, the launch attempts began over the Étang de Berre at Martigues near Marseille. The second launch was successful and the plane flew around 600 m. The next day it was even 6 km. The filigree Hydravion proved to be very stable. After a crash on landing, the plane was overhauled. In April 1911, the new version started with the pilot Jean Bécue in Monaco. Henri Fabre was soon contacted by Glenn Curtiss and Gabriel Voisin who used his invention to develop their own seaplanes. Fabre died at the Methuselah age of 101 in 1984 and was one of the last living aviation pioneers. As late as 1971, Fabre said he was still sailing his own boat single-handedly in Marseille harbour."

 curtiss.21.d: "With the establishment of a national airline, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag] has become a keyland of human advancement."
 curtiss.21.f: "State airlines are more expensive than their private counterparts and do not have the same benefits. However, they do not get into financial difficulties and are therefore somewhat better protected against risks."
 curtiss.21.g: "Champagne!"
 curtiss.22.t: "Privatization of National Airline"
 curtiss.22.d: "After a recent constitutional amendment, the government announced that the state-owned airline would be dissolved and turned into a private company."
 curtiss.22.f: "The liberalization of the economy has meant that our state-owned airline no longer has a future in this form. In fact, there are many politicians who are relieved because airlines are an expensive luxury. A wealthy investor has also been found in [SCOPE.sCharacter('howard_hughes').GetFullName], who will manage the company in the future. The sale will result in high privatization proceeds, but some lobbyists argue that these should be foregone in order to help the new companies get started. We should be content enough just getting rid of the running costs."

 curtiss.23.t: "Nationalization of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] Airlines"
 curtiss.23.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] Airlines is still considered one of the largest private companies in the entire country. Voices are being raised that it should be placed under state control."
 curtiss.23.f: "It is perfectly clear that a company as large as [SCOPE.sCharacter('howard_hughes').GetFullName]'s [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] Airlines Company should either be broken up or nationalized. As a result, senior officials have already presented plans to transfer the private company to state ownership. A group advocates a transaction that is as legal as possible to cover the procedure. Others, on the other hand, see an opportunity to set an example and confiscate [SCOPE.sCharacter('howard_hughes').GetFullName]'s assets and donate them to the public good."

 curtiss.30.t: "Il Vate"
 curtiss.30.d: "The great writer [SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_dannunzio').GetFullName] heard the call of war and made himself available as a pilot."
 curtiss.30.f: "Gabriele D'Annunzio was an Italian poet, playwright, orator, journalist, aristocrat, and Royal Italian Army officer during World War I. He occupied a prominent place in Italian literature from 1889 to 1910 and later political life from 1914 to 1924. He was often referred to under the epithets Il Vate ('the Poet'). D'Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French symbolism and British aestheticism. Such works represented a turn against the naturalism of the preceding romantics and was both sensuous and mystical. He came under the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche which would find outlets in his literary and later political contributions. During the First World War, perception of D'Annunzio in Italy transformed from literary figure into a national war hero. He was associated with the elite Arditi storm troops of the Italian Army and took part in actions such as the Flight over Vienna."

 curtiss.31.f: "Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen was a German officer and fighter pilot during World War I. He achieved the highest number of aerial victories in that war as a single pilot. Richthofen became one of the most famous pilots in the world, who is still remembered in films, books and other media to this day. Nicknames such as the Red Baron are due to his noble lineage and the red livery of his aircraft."

 curtiss.40.t: "Non-stop across the Atlantic"
 curtiss.40.d: "Completely alone and on his own, the young pilot [SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_lindbergh').GetFullName] was the first person to complete the route between New York and Paris without stopping. While some call him a 'flying fool', he triggers a storm of enthusiasm in the population beyond and is celebrated as a national hero."
 curtiss.40.f: "After an overwhelming flight, the previously unknown pilot [SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_lindbergh').GetFullName] has achieved a brilliant feat in the art of flying. A crowd, hearing of his success, greeted him with raptures. Over the 33,5 hours of his flight, [SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_lindbergh').GetLastName] faced many challenges, which included skimming over storm clouds at 10,000 ft (3,000 m) and wave tops at as low as 10 ft (3.0 m). The aircraft fought icing, flew blind through fog for several hours, and [SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_lindbergh').GetLastName] navigated only by dead reckoning (he was not proficient at navigating by the sun and stars and he rejected radio navigation gear as heavy and unreliable). He was fortunate that the winds over the Atlantic cancelled each other out, giving him zero wind drift—and thus accurate navigation during the long flight over featureless ocean. His achievement will encourage significant global interest in both commercial aviation and air mail, revolutionizing the aviation industry worldwide"

 curtiss.42.t: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_lindbergh').GetLastName]' Flight"
 curtiss.42.d: "With the transatlantic flight of the charismatic young pilot [SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_lindbergh').GetFullName], our population caught fire and discovered a hitherto unknown passion for aviation.

 curtiss.50.t: "The Future of Aeronautics"
 curtiss.50.d: "With the further development of aeronautical technology and the development of civil aviation, the question arises as to whether our nation wants to invest in the development of airplanes or airships."
 curtiss.50.f: "'True, the fragile bodies of his fellows do not weigh down his plane; true, the fretful minds of weaker men are missing from his crowded cabin; but as his airship keeps its course he holds communion with those rare spirits that inspire to intrepidity and by their sustaining potency give strength to arm, resource to mind, content to soul. Alone? With what other companions would man fly to whom the choice were given?' - Charles Lindbergh"
 curtiss.50.g: "Airplanes."
 curtiss.50.h: "Airships."
 curtiss.51.t: "Helium discovered"
 curtiss.51.d: "While drilling for oil, our workers came across a gas field with a helium deposit in [SCOPE.sState('curtiss_helium_state').GetName]. This discovery could be useful for our aviation industry."
 curtiss.51.f: "The first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun (helios). On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth. After an oil drilling operation in 1903 in Kansas produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas. With further analysis, Hamilton Cady and David McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas. Although the extraction process using low-temperature gas liquefaction was not developed in time to be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft."
 curtiss.51.g: "We need a strategic reserve."
 curtiss.52.t: "Helium reserve lost"
 curtiss.52.d: "Without access to oil and gas fields, we are no longer able to mine helium."
 curtiss.52.g: "That shouldn't be a big problem... right?"
 curtiss.53.t: "Graf Ferdinand von Zeppelin"
 curtiss.53.d: "A new era in aviation began today with the flight of Ferdinand von Zeppelin's airship."
 curtiss.53.f: "On August 13, 1898, Zeppelin obtained Reich patent number 98580 for a 'steerable aircraft with several support bodies arranged one behind the other'. The most important features of Zeppelin's design were the rigid aluminum frame made up of rings and longitudinal members, the firm connection of the two gondolas to the frame, the division of the gas space into cylindrical cells of equal size, and the attachment of propellers at the height of the air resistance centre. The airships were called zeppelins. Zeppelin's ideas continued to be largely rejected and ridiculed by experts and the general public; Kaiser Wilhelm II described the count as the 'stupidest of all southern Germans'. During this time, Zeppelin said: 'Of course nobody stands up for me, because nobody wants to take the leap into the dark. But my goal is clear and my calculations are correct'. In 1900, the LZ 1 made three ascents over Lake Constance, with Zeppelin's technical manager being the engineer Fritz Burr. The ever better results led to spontaneous enthusiasm among the population, which made a decisive contribution to the Count being able to further develop the technology of airships and their operation."
 curtiss.53.g: "A misjudged genius was right."

 curtiss.100.t: "The Schneider Trophy"
 curtiss.100.d: "The preparations are complete, the prize money has been awarded and the trophy donated. The fight for the Schneider Trophy, the most prestigious award ever offered for an air race, will begin in 3 months!"
 curtiss.100.f: "The Coupe d'Aviation Maritime Jacques Schneider, also known as the Schneider Trophy, Schneider Prize or Schneider Cup is a trophy that was awarded annually (and later, biennially) to the winner of a race for seaplanes and flying boats. The race was significant in advancing aeroplane design, particularly in the fields of aerodynamics and engine design, and would show its results in the best fighters of World War II. The streamlined shape and the low drag, liquid-cooled engine pioneered by Schneider Trophy designs are obvious in the British Supermarine Spitfire, the American North American P-51 Mustang, and the Italian Macchi C.202 Folgore. The contests were very popular and some attracted crowds of over 200,000 spectators."
 curtiss.100.g: "Send the invitations!"
 curtiss.101.d: "We have received an invitation to participate in the Schneider Trophy race! The race is organized by [SCOPE.sCountry('curtiss_schneider_trophy_host').GetName]."

 curtiss.102.d: "The preparations are complete. Soon the whole world will flock to [SCOPE.sState('curtiss_schneider_trophy_state').GetName] to witness a world-class race between state-of-the-art seaplanes in 3 months."
 curtiss.103.t: "Support for our Team"
 curtiss.103.d: "The race for the Schneider Trophy will begin soon. The world will watch how our pilots fare - and our country too. We can improve our team's chances if we help the team financially. Of course, all this has its price..."
 curtiss.103.f: "The competition for the Schneider Trophy first began as a race between various pilots and their planes, with little government support. By the 1920s, however, the race had gained such publicity that hundreds of thousands attended the races. With that, the race and its importance had taken on a new dimension. When the USA and Italy officially supported their teams soon after, the competition mutated into a tournament of nations. At first this interference was felt to be inadmissible, but the threat of a competitive disadvantage forced other countries, such as Great Britain, to officially support their team so that they did not fall behind."
 curtiss.103.g: "No price is too high for national honor!"
 curtiss.103.h: "The team is good the way it is."
 curtiss.104.t: "Schneider Trophy Training"
 curtiss.104.d: "In view of the forthcoming competition for the prestigious Schneider Trophy, there are considerations as to whether our pilots should complete extra training."
 curtiss.104.f: "No athlete goes into the competition unprepared - the same goes for the pilots for the upcoming race. However, there are always discussions about the training that takes place before the competitions. The high speeds and risky maneuvers are a guarantee that our team will achieve a better place. Records were even broken during some training sessions. But at the same time, the exercises are considered risky. In contrast to the race for the Schneider Trophy, in which there were no serious accidents, ten pilots had fatal accidents during the preparations from 1923 to 1931."
 curtiss.104.g: "Our pilots need better training!"
 curtiss.104.h: "This is too dangerous."
 curtiss.105.t: "New Record!"
 curtiss.105.d: "The additional training for the Schneider Trophy was worth it. The team not only completed the course without making any mistakes, but also set a new speed record. These are good prospects for the upcoming race!"

 curtiss.106.d: "Maybe it was the weather, maybe it was the motivation - but unfortunately our team only achieved mediocre results in training for the Schneider Trophy. It might be better than nothing, but we had higher expectations of our pilots."
 curtiss.106.f: "'It is hard enough for anyone to map out a course of action and stick to it, particularly in the face of the desires of one's friends; but it is doubly hard for an aviator to stay on the ground waiting for just the right moment to go into the air.' - Glenn Curtiss"
 curtiss.106.g: "Better than nothing."
 curtiss.107.t: "Training incident!"
 curtiss.107.d: "The last training session for the Schneider Trophy ended in disaster - for reasons that are still unclear, one of our pilots lost control of his plane and crashed into the water with full force. Although the casualty was able to be rescued with great effort, it will take weeks to repair the loss and determine the cause of the error. The fact that we will also be missing one of our most capable pilots for the upcoming race reduces our chances in the fight for the Schneider Trophy."

 curtiss.107.g: "Disastrous!"
 curtiss.108.t: "Schneider Trophy Pilot"
 curtiss.108.d: "The question is still open as to which pilot will lead the team that competes in the Schneider Trophy race."
 curtiss.108.f: "Usually the Schneider Cup was not a race of nations, but of pilots; however, it soon became common practice for several pilots from one country to start as a team, usually in a crew of three pilots for three aircraft. A cult soon developed around individual pilots, while in later years team effort prevailed."

This prestigious trophy is more than just a prize for a sporting event: it is a symbol of technical superiority and a nation's will to surpass itself and conquer the skies. Whoever holds the Schneider Trophy will be the envy of the world.

Our pilots will go down in history as national heroes, and decades from now people will still be talking about the brave pilots who made that final victory possible. The Schneider Trophy is now ours and the whole world is looking at us with envy!"
 curtiss.113.f: "With the third victory, the Schneider Trophy has finally come into the hands of a single nation. On the one hand, this is a big day for aviation; On the other hand, however, the melancholy thought remains that with the record-breaking development of aviation, the pioneering age of aviation is coming to an end in favor of an age of silver, in which no longer human ambition but pure mechanics dominate."

 curtiss.114.g: "Bitter. Very bitter."
 curtiss.121.t: "Mechanical problems"
 curtiss.121.d: "The Schneider Trophy was notorious for the fact that many pilots were not even able to take part in the competition because travel was already a problem. Some machines were damaged, others suffered from engine problems, the cause of which could not be remedied by the time the starting signal was given. Mechanical problems caused entire teams to drop out."
 curtiss.121.f: "There are isolated, completely negligible voices that claim that the Schneider Trophy was a complete failure. Because the ongoing engine problems, difficulties with the journey and the death of test pilots would have led to the fact that many teams could not compete - which led to a thinning out of the competition. France, the historical birthplace of the seaplane, could hardly participate in the race because of such problems. Countries like Great Britain or Italy won several times because they provided the only plane that could take part in the race at all."
 curtiss.121.g: "Bunglers!"
 curtiss.122.t: "Crash!"
 curtiss.122.d: "During a maneuver, our pilot overestimated himself - and crashed into the water!"
 curtiss.122.f: "Despite its challenges, the race for the Schneider Trophy has not resulted in a fatality or serious accident in the twenty years of its existence. However, this does not rule out the possibility that such a disaster could not have led to such a disaster given the high speeds and the aircraft construction, which was still in its pioneering days."
 curtiss.122.g: "Yikes!"
 curtiss.123.t: "Buoy overlooked"
 curtiss.123.d: "Our team flew a good lap in the Schneider Trophy race, but one of the pilots was threatened with a point deduction because one of the referees complained that he had overlooked a buoy."
 curtiss.123.f: "In 1919, the Italian team won in Bournemouth, UK, in foggy conditions. The referees at the Swanage bend asserted that Guido Janello, the winner of the race, did not round the buoy correctly. The former said that the error was due to bad organization and that a non-official boat had cheated him. However, Janello was disqualified and the Schneider Trophy was not awarded this year. Italy was later compensated for holding the next race in Venice. To this day, the memory of the disqualification causes great frustration among Italian aircraft nostalgics, because Italy also won in 1920 and 1921 and would have won the Schneider Trophy forever in retrospect."
 curtiss.123.g: "That's bad luck, of course."
 curtiss.123.h: "Try to bribe the referee ..."
 curtiss.124.t: "Maximum Speed"
 curtiss.124.d: "Along the route, our pilots can show what our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] machines are made of."
 curtiss.124.f: "The Schneider Trophy was primarily a high-speed race in which the latest aircraft technology and the personal achievement of the pilot played a prominent role. In order to achieve a good result, the latest technologies, the national focus on aircraft construction and the personal qualities of a pilot count. Ace pilots and Schneider Trophy veterans do better, but so do particularly daring or innovative characters."

 curtiss.125.t: "Slalom maneuvers"
 curtiss.125.d: "The Schneider Trophy is best known as a speed competition, but there were three to four marks that could be missed at high speed - and could result in disqualification."
 curtiss.125.f: "Most of the Schneider Trophy races took place on a triangular route, which is why turning maneuvers were rather rare. That's not to say they didn't play a part, though; one misstep has cost a pilot many a victory. In such a maneuver, the qualities of the pilot are crucial: experienced pilots, as well as cautious characters will achieve a better result than the overly impetuous ones. Training at the pilot school has an additional advantage."
 curtiss.125.g: "Fly with elegance."
 curtiss.126.t: "Fog"
 curtiss.126.d: "Fog was more often a problem on the waterways. Even experienced pilots could fail at this sudden challenge."

Some of the winches were already installed and the 86th floor was prepared as a departure lounge with ticket counter and customs control.

He spoke of a small six-figure sum. The aircraft to be built will bear the name of our country's capital: [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName]."

 curtiss.501.t: "Type of Airplane"
 curtiss.501.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] aircraft designers have not yet decided whether the machine should be a classic aircraft or a flying boat."
 curtiss.501.f: "Seaplanes were not just a fad. They had significant advantages over conventional aircraft from the 1910s through the 1940s. They did not need runways and could land on any surface of water. This applied to the sea, but also to larger lakes. While airports were outside of cities, seaplanes could potentially use the old seaports. Nations with long coastlines, such as Italy, therefore saw seaplanes and flying boats as clearly more useful; even a mainland city like Milan had a water airport with an artificial lake near Linate. Seaplanes therefore also offered advantages for the Atlantic states of Great Britain and the USA."
 curtiss.501.g: "It's going to be a classic plane."
 curtiss.501.h: "It will be a flying boat."
 curtiss.502.t: "Construction materials"
 curtiss.502.d: "When planning the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], there is still disagreement about which material should be used."
 curtiss.502.f: "When aviation was in its infancy, wood and fabric dominated aircraft construction. The advantage of the lightness of these materials was already known in the First World War, but at the same time they were confronted with their disadvantages. They were hardly weatherproof and quickly fell into disrepair. Therefore, in the following years, the partial metal construction and finally the all-metal construction prevailed. Metal was in many cases heavier than wood when aluminum was not available. However, its toughness made it the more desirable material even when new problems arose, such as with metal corrosion or metal fatigue."
 curtiss.502.g: "Only use metal if necessary. This aircraft will be primarily made of wood."
 curtiss.502.h: "Clad it all in metall."
 curtiss.503.t: "Engine issues"
 curtiss.503.d: "Work on the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] progressed. The plane is slowly taking shape. The question of the engines has not yet been finally clarified: there are two variants."
 curtiss.503.f: "During World War II and up until the mid-1950s, reciprocating aircraft engines with a take-off power of over 3680 kW (5000 hp) and a displacement of more than 70 liters were produced to power fighter planes, bombers and large passenger aircraft. For example, the Wright R-3350 and Pratt & Whitney R-4360 engines were outstanding. They are still considered to be the pinnacle of aircraft engine mechanics before the triumph of the jet aircraft. The Wright R-3350 is an 18 cylinder engine and the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 is a 28 cylinder engine."
 curtiss.503.g: "Ten 18-cylinder engines are perfect."
 curtiss.503.h: "We are in need of eight 28-cylinder engines."
 curtiss.504.t: "Propellers"
 curtiss.504.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] is developing extremely well. According to [SCOPE.sCharacter('howard_hughes').GetLastName], the estimated construction time will be met. Even if not all questions have been answered. There was a recent revision to the question of how many blades the propellers should have."
 curtiss.504.f: "In principle, a single-bladed propeller is the most efficient, since the inflow of the rotating propeller blade is least disturbed by the turbulence of the leading blade. However, it requires a counterweight, loads the drive shaft asymmetrically and vibrates relatively heavily, which is why this type of design is rarely used. A higher number of blades has a positive effect on the vibration behavior, especially if the individual blades are subjected to different flows over the propeller circle. On piston engine powered aircraft, two bladed propellers are most common. The turboprop and propfan engines of larger aircraft, on the other hand, have 3 to 7 or even more blades."
 curtiss.504.g: "4-bladed propellers will fit."
 curtiss.504.h: "We'll need 5-bladed propellers."
 curtiss.505.t: "The Greatest Day in History"

Then, as those present grasped the unthinkable, a reporter asked, '[SCOPE.sCharacter('howard_hughes').GetFirstName], did you expect that?'

 curtiss.507.f_hughes: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] rumbled. Her engines roared. The tension in [SCOPE.sCharacter('howard_hughes').GetLastName]'s face grew. 75 miles. 85 miles. 95 miles - but the monster did not take off. The colossus stuck to the ground. After a few minutes of the screening, the first snippy comment came from a journalist. It was followed by the voices of the critics who had known about it beforehand. The politicians made allegations. The representatives of the big corporations also questioned previous agreements. The aircraft tycoon tried one last time to drag his creature into the air - in vain. It was the unhappiest day of his career. Eventually [SCOPE.sCharacter('howard_hughes').GetLastName] broke off the attempt.

That's how it had to be. He shed all his doubts. He married the giant plane to the sky - and was the only one to notice the one after the decimal point, while journalists and business representatives celebrated and cheered in the background. But his instinct had not deceived him. It took the rest of the crew moments longer before the cheers turned to screams of terror. The rest was noise and fire. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] rammed into roofs, shattered walls, doused rows of houses with oil and, with the crashing down of a titan, devastated a neighborhood on fire.

Between 1910 and 1914, Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft (DELAG) transported thousands of passengers by airship. In 1917, the German LZ 104 (L 59) was the first airship to make an intercontinental flight, from Jambol in Bulgaria to Khartoum and back, a nonstop journey of 6,800 kilometres (4,200 mi; 3,700 nmi). During and just after the war, Britain and the United States built airships, and France and Italy experimented with confiscated German ones. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin delivered LZ 126 to the US Navy as a war reparation in October 1924. The company chairman Dr. Hugo Eckener commanded the delivery flight, and the ship was commissioned as the USS Los Angeles (ZR-3). During 1925, the Versailles restrictions were relaxed by the Allies, enabling Dr Hugo Eckener, the chairman of Zeppelin Luftschiffbau, to pursue his vision of developing a zeppelin suitable for launching an intercontinental air passenger service. Accordingly, Zeppelin Lufftschiffbau began construction of the first of a new generation of airships, the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin. On 18 September 1928, the completed airship flew for the first time. During its career, Graf Zeppelin crossed the South Atlantic a total of 136 times."

Although both routes proved unprofitable because of the ice, maps of the polar region should not lose their usefulness in aiding later exploration."
 curtiss.531.f_meo: "Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky."

It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet.

 curtiss.532.f_meo: "Owing to motion of fluid in the Earth's outer core, the actual magnetic poles are constantly moving. However, over thousands of years, their direction averages to the Earth's rotation axis. On the order of once every half a million years, the poles reverse although the time frame of this switching can be anywhere from every 10 thousand years to every 50 million years. Although the geomagnetic pole is only theoretical and cannot be located directly, it arguably is of more practical relevance than the magnetic (dip) pole. This is because the poles describe a great deal about the Earth's magnetic field, determining for example where auroras can be observed."
 curtiss.532.f_bio: "Found primarily in Canadian Arctic and Greenlandic and Russian waters, the narwhal is a uniquely specialised Arctic predator. In winter, it feeds on benthic prey, mostly flatfish, under dense pack ice. During the summer, narwhals eat mostly Arctic cod and Greenland halibut, with other fish such as polar cod making up the remainder of their diet. The most conspicuous characteristic of the male narwhal is a single long tusk, which is in fact a canine tooth. Some medieval Europeans believed narwhal tusks to be the horns from the legendary unicorn."
 curtiss.532.g: "We should stay longer."
 curtiss.532.h: "We risk a change in the weather - keep flying!"

 curtiss.533.t_meo: "Meteorological station"
 curtiss.533.t_bio: "Searching fossiles"
 curtiss.533.d_geo: "The members of the Zeppelin mission have a great need to verify their theories and to measure parts of the Arctic. However, this requires a not entirely unrisky landing."
 curtiss.533.d_meo: "Meteorologists aboard the airship have announced their willingness to set up a makeshift meteorological station in the Arctic to conduct ground experiments. However, this means that the zeppelin has to complete a landing manoeuvre."
 curtiss.533.d_bio: "The biologists on board the polar zeppelin are convinced that fossils of prehistoric animals and plants may lie in the eternal ice and persuade the pilot to land the airship. However, this is associated with dangers."
 curtiss.533.f_geo: "Landings in the polar region were uncommon, but not impossible. In 1931, the 'Graf Zeppelin' performed a masterly feat on its Arctic Sea voyage. She landed on the water between floating ice floes. This not entirely harmless maneuver went perfectly. A mailbag with 50,000 letters, provided with the Zeppelin special postmark, was handed over to a Soviet icebreaker anchored nearby. The profit from this additional business was considerable. The geodetic, meteorological and geographical results were impressive: 'In 106 hours of arctic flight, the airship did the work that normal expeditions on icebreakers only do in two to three years', stated the scientific leader of the research trip, the director of the Leningrad Arctic Institute Professor Samoilovich."

 curtiss.533.g: "Try a landing."
 curtiss.533.h: "This is too risky."
 curtiss.534.t: "Strong winds"
 curtiss.534.d: "Suddenly arising polar winds make the crossing difficult."
 curtiss.534.f: "Natural phenomena such as strong winds and storms can be both a danger and an opportunity for airships. Nations that have resorted to airship building, or have an ace pilot, are better able to deal with such challenges; for nations without these advantages, the forces of nature pose a great danger."
 curtiss.534.g: "These winds will give our airship and science a tailwind!"
 curtiss.534.h: "This is madness! Change course!"
 curtiss.534.i: "Our superior airship will easily meet this challenge."
 curtiss.535.t: "Polar Storm"
 curtiss.535.d: "The zeppelin mission got caught in a dangerous polar storm."
 curtiss.535.f: "Natural phenomena such as strong winds and storms can be both a danger and an opportunity for airships. Nations that have resorted to airship building, or have an ace pilot, are better able to deal with such challenges; for nations without these advantages, the forces of nature pose a great danger."
 curtiss.535.g: "We must risk the passage."
 curtiss.535.h: "Try to get us out of harm's way, whatever the cost!"
 curtiss.535.i: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('curtiss_expedition_leader').GetFullName] will save the day."
 curtiss.536.t: "Clear Weather"
 curtiss.536.d: "Clear weather and a smooth flight allow the zeppelin crew to use the extra time."
 curtiss.536.f: "'Anyone who has not seen the polar country in the splendor of its glaciers, in the rich symphony of colors of its glittering floes and the often fantastically shaped islands and foothills, knows nothing of the most beautiful things our earth has to offer.' - Hugo Eckener"
 curtiss.536.g: "Conduct an experiment."
 curtiss.536.h: "Repairs the airship."
 curtiss.537.t: "Icy propellers"
 curtiss.537.d: "The cold weather is taking its toll: the propellers are iced up and in danger of breaking."
 curtiss.537.f: "Ice on the propellers not only means that we have to throttle the engines to de-ice them. Should the hard ice come loose, it could damage the zeppelin envelope or instruments. The zeppelin is already losing height noticeably. Some men think it's better to shed 'unnecessary ballast' to gain altitude - much to the chagrin of researchers."
 curtiss.537.g: "Keep calm and carry on."
 curtiss.537.h: "Drop ballast!"
 curtiss.538.t: "Zeppelin Anchorage"
 curtiss.538.d: "The polar expedition has found a good place to take a break and do maintenance or experiments."
 curtiss.538.f: "As early as 1910, German researchers undertook an expedition to Spitsbergen to prepare a research voyage with a zeppelin. At that time, the search for suitable airship ports played an important role. One consequence of the expedition was the establishment of the first year-round German weather station on Spitsbergen."
 curtiss.538.g: "A good place for a rest."
 curtiss.538.h: "We should establish a permanent research station."
 curtiss.539.t: "Engine failure!"
 curtiss.539.d: "One of the zeppelin engines suddenly stopped working today! The team sees no way to fix it."
 curtiss.539.f: "A single engine failure doesn't have to be a disaster; Airships usually have multiple engines. However, such an incident in combination with other accidents can have dramatic consequences."
 curtiss.539.g: "This trip is ill-fated."
