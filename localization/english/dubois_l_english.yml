 dubois_theory_of_evolution_tech: "Theory of Evolution"
 dubois_theory_of_evolution_tech_desc: "The crucial break from the concept of constant typological types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection. Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a 'struggle for existence' in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe."
 dubois_paleontology_tech: "Paleontology"
 dubois_paleontology_tech_desc: "An interest in the history of the earth and extinct animals can be traced back to antiquity and reached a first peak with the studies of Georges Cuvier around 1800. But the publication of the 'On the Origin of Species' was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of 'Origin' led to a concerted effort to look for transitional fossils and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record."
 dubois_genetics_tech: "Genetics"
 dubois_genetics_tech_desc: "Modern genetics began with the work of the Augustinian friar Gregor Johann Mendel. The 1900 rediscovery of Mendel's work led to rapid advances in genetics. By 1915 the basic principles of Mendelian genetics had been studied in a wide variety of organisms — most notably the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Alongside experimental work, mathematicians developed the statistical framework of population genetics, bringing genetic explanations into the study of evolution."

Except Veli Pacha's lion in  the Morea, who followed the Arab keeper like a dog, the fondness of the hyaena for her keeper amused me most. Such a conversazione! — There was a 'hippopotamus', like Lord Liverpool in the face; and the 'Ursine Sloth' hath the very voice and manner of my valet - but the tiger talked too much. The elephant took and gave me my money again - took off my hat, opened a door. trunked a whip, and behaved so well, that I wish he was my butler. The handsomest animal on earth is one of the panthers; but the poor antelopes were dead. I should hate to see one here: the sight of the camel made me pine again for Asia Minor.' -Lord Byron"

I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.' -Charles Darwin"

Kosmos began as a lecture series delivered by Humboldt at the University of Berlin, and was published in five volumes between 1845 and 1862 (the fifth was posthumous and incomplete)."

The striking-regularity with which the same hybrid forms always reappeared whenever fertilisation took place between the same species induced further experiments to be undertaken, the object of which was to follow up the developments of the hybrids in their progeny.' -Gregor Mendel"

 dubois.6.f: "The fossils first discovered by [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_new_paleontologist_scope').GetFullName] in 1891 on the banks of the Solo River near Trinil in East Java are called Java Man. According to current knowledge, they are said to be around one million years old. They were the first fossils of hominins to be discovered outside of Europe and, after Neanderthals, the second evidence of fossil relatives of anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens). The finds from Java were first referred to as Anthropopithecus and later as Pithecanthropus erectus. Today they are assigned to the species Homo erectus by most paleoanthropologists, whereby their origin is occasionally - as suggested by Franz Weidenreich in 1940 - emphasized by the addition of a subspecies epithet: Homo erectus javanensis. More than 50 years after Dubois's find, Ralph von Koenigswald recollected that, 'No other paleontological discovery has created such a sensation and led to such a variety of conflicting scientific opinions.'"

 dubois.32.d: "Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] has located the animal he is looking for. Now it is important to drive the animal into a situation with a careful approach so that we can catch it."
 dubois.32.f.hippopotamus.1: "A local says he saw a herd of hippos bathing in the nearest river days ago. The inhabitants of the village do not approach these; they tend towards great aggression, even the big game does not dare to approach them. Their roar could be heard from a great distance. 'You can hear them near the village, especially at night when the animals are particularly active and migrate to their pastures', says the local. A mother hippo is said to have recently killed a crocodile to defend a cub; Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] was able to see this for himself when he examined the carcass of the unfortunate reptile."
 dubois.32.f.hippopotamus.2: "As the morning mist lifts, the silhouette of a colossal creature emerges from the murky depths of the river. Tales of the elusive river giants have spread among the locals, speaking of their unmatched strength and fearsome nature. The hippos, with their massive jaws and ivory tusks, command respect and instill terror in the hearts of all who cross their path. Only a daring [concept_dubois_naturalist] like Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] could hope to capture such a formidable beast, for it is said that even the king of the jungle treads lightly in their domain."
 dubois.32.f.hippopotamus.3: "Rumors of a legendary hippopotamus have captivated the imaginations of explorers, and their accounts echo through the dense undergrowth of the African savannah. This behemoth, known as "The Ivory Behemoth," possesses ivory-like armor plates that glisten in the sunlight, rendering it nearly invulnerable to the teeth and claws of other predators. The local tribes revere the creature, attributing mythical powers to its presence. To behold this majestic beast, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] must navigate treacherous swamps and overcome the perils of the wild, armed only with his knowledge and the hope of capturing a living legend for the world to marvel at in wonder."
 dubois.32.f.lion.1: "Across the vast expanse of the untamed African plains, a majestic predator reigns supreme. The lion, with its golden mane and piercing gaze, stands as the embodiment of power and regal authority. Its mighty roar resonates through the air, sending shivers down the spines of both prey and predator alike. The locals speak of a lioness, known as "The Queen of the Savannah," who has single-handedly defended her pride against rival clans and even fended off the ferocious hyenas. To capture the essence of such magnificence, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] must venture into the heart of the savannah, where danger lurks in every shadow, and witness the raw prowess of nature's royal monarch."
 dubois.32.f.lion.2: "Deep within the African wilderness, a feline monarch commands its domain with unwavering authority. The lion, known as "The Golden Sovereign," possesses a mane that shimmers like the sun's rays, making it an unmistakable symbol of power and dominance. Tales of its incredible strength and stealth have traveled far and wide, captivating the minds of adventurers and naturalists alike. The locals whisper of a rare sighting, a clash of titans between The Golden Sovereign and a formidable Cape buffalo. To witness this epic encounter, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] must tread carefully through the savannah, navigating a realm where only the fearless dare to venture."
 dubois.32.f.lion.3: "In the heart of the African wilderness, where the sweltering heat is tempered by the awe-inspiring beauty of the savannah, roams a creature feared and revered by all. The lion, with its muscular build and predatory grace, embodies the essence of untamed majesty. Its thunderous roar echoes across the plains, a resonating call to all creatures that the king of beasts is near. Legends tell of a lion pride led by an indomitable patriarch, whose sheer presence commands respect from even the most formidable predators. To observe this majestic ruler in his natural habitat, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] must overcome the challenges of the wild, immersing himself in a world where the balance between life and death hangs by a delicate thread."
 dubois.32.f.elephant.1: "A herd of elephants stomps dust into the air. A caravan, led by a matriarch, moves through the countryside. Hudnerte, sometimes thousands of kilometers such groups cover sometimes. Young animals remain in the care of their mothers. Then the group stops in a small grove, stretching their trunks up into trees. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] observes the events through binoculars and studies social behavior. Basically, he has grown sick of the idea of snatching one of the animals from the herd, but the zoo's patrons remind him that his trip and food was not provided free of charge by the state - there is a job to be done."
 dubois.32.f.elephant.2: "The gentle giants of the savannah, elephants, roam the vast landscapes in search of nourishment and water. Their immense size commands respect, yet their tender interactions within the herd reveal a deep sense of familial bonds. Led by a wise matriarch, the elephants traverse great distances, their synchronized footsteps echoing through the grasslands. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName], with a heavy heart, sets his gaze upon them, torn between admiration for their grace and the task that lies ahead. To capture an elephant for the zoo, he must reconcile his duty with the understanding that disrupting the intricate tapestry of their social fabric comes at a profound cost."
 dubois.32.f.elephant.3: "In the shadow of towering baobab trees, a congregation of elephants, adorned with magnificent tusks, gathers at a tranquil watering hole. The matriarch's keen eyes scan the surroundings, ensuring the safety of her precious kin. The harmonious symphony of their trumpets fills the air, a testament to their collective wisdom and shared experiences. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName], conflicted by the allure of capturing one of these sentient beings and the nagging weight of responsibility, wrestles with the moral implications of his quest. As he observes their complex social dynamics, he grapples with the profound question of whether the pursuit of knowledge justifies the disruption of a harmonious existence."
 dubois.32.f.giraffe.1: "For days, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName]'s safari group had been looking for the mere sign of a giraffe, but had not found anything until the very end. But one morning the necks of the elegant animals stretch in the air against the rising morning sun and form shadows against the reddish fireball. The Safari team sets out immediately so as not to miss this opportunity."
 dubois.32.f.giraffe.2: "Through the golden hues of the African dawn, a wondrous sight unfolds. Tall and graceful, the giraffes emerge from the dense foliage, their elongated necks reaching towards the heavens. Like ethereal beings, they cast elongated shadows against the fiery sky, their spots blending seamlessly with the dappled light. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName], his heart filled with awe, scrambles to assemble his equipment, determined not to let this fleeting moment slip away. With each careful step, he ventures closer to the giraffes, eager to unravel the mysteries hidden within their extraordinary anatomy and observe the poetry of their movements."
 dubois.32.f.giraffe.3: "In the vast African plains, a vision of elegance unfolds as the giraffes gracefully navigate the verdant landscape. Their slender legs carry them with a balletic grace, while their long necks extend high above the trees, as if reaching for the heavens themselves. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] and his safari team, their hearts pounding with anticipation, witness this mesmerizing spectacle. With a keen eye for detail, the professor studies the intricate patterns of their spots and marvels at their ability to thrive in their unique habitat. To capture the essence of these magnificent creatures, he must navigate the delicate balance between observation and intrusion, preserving the magic that makes giraffes the epitome of grace in the wild."
 dubois.32.f.zebra.1: "A few weeks after arriving in Africa, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName]'s safari caught up with locals about the next herd of zebras roaming the region. It doesn't take long before they find the animals with the characteristic stripes in the evening sun between savannah dust, bushes and gnarled trees. The graceful animals don't even seem to notice them. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] first wants to take the time to study the behavior and lifestyle of the zebra herd, but like many other researchers he is interested in finding out the evolutionary background of the famous zebra pattern. Unfortunately, he is interrupted by a member of the safari team, who points out that if they wait too long, the herd may move on again."
 dubois.32.f.zebra.2: "Maybe following zebras wasn't the best decision. These animals could move up to 500 kilometers from place to place and thus change the center  of the herd to large geographical latitudes. However, there was one quirk that made them predictable: they usually stayed no more than 12 kilometers from a water source. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName]'s safari takes this detail as an opportunity to wait at the next possible watering hole. With success! Soon the herd shows up again, giving the opportunity to finally catch one of the animals for the zoo."
 dubois.32.f.zebra.3: "After several weeks of searching for zebras, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] spots the carcass of a mangled animal in the distance. It was apparently the victim of a lion attack. Since the lions have only recently moved away, the safari team is motivated to continue the search more intensively. Soon loud snorts and mixed calls from donkey and horse-like noises sound. Zebra tails whip in the air over savannah grass. The safari participants watch a grazing herd from a hill."

Its native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean and its surrounding seas and landmasses, which includes the northernmost regions of North America and Eurasia. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals. Unlike brown bears, polar bears are not territorial. Although stereotyped as being voraciously aggressive, they are normally cautious in confrontations, and often choose to escape rather than fight."

Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first described it as grisley, which could be interpreted as either "grizzly" (i.e., "grizzled"—that is, with grey-tipped hair) or "grisly" ("fear-inspiring", now usually "gruesome"). Grizzly bears are some of the largest subspecies of Brown Bear, only being beaten by the Kamchatka brown bears and the Kodiak bears. Grizzly bears vary in size depending on timing and populations. The original range of grizzly bears includes large parts of western and central North America. It descends from a Eurasian population of brown bears that migrated across the temporarily dry Bering Strait."

Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting. The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down upon and snatches from the water with its talons. Bald eagles are not actually bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, 'white headed'. The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States of America and appears on its seal."

 dubois.104.f: "The American bison (Bison bison), also called the American buffalo or simply buffalo, is a species of bison native to North America. It is one of two extant species of bison, alongside the European bison. Buffalo was applied to the American bison by Samuel de Champlain as the French word buffles in 1616, after seeing skins and a drawing. These were shown to him by members of the Nipissing First Nation. The word bison was applied in the 1690s. A bison has a shaggy, long, dark-brown winter coat, and a lighter-weight, lighter-brown summer coat. Male bison are significantly larger and heavier than females. Once roaming in vast herds, the species nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle."

It lives in pinelands, tropical hardwood hammocks, and mixed freshwater swamp forests. Florida panthers are spotted at birth, and typically have blue eyes. As the panther grows, the spots fade and the coat becomes completely tan, while the eyes typically take on a yellow hue. The panther's underbelly is a creamy white, and it has black tips on the tail and ears. Florida panthers lack the ability to roar, and instead make distinct sounds that include whistles, chirps, growls, hisses, and purrs."

 dubois.106.t: "Alligator"
 dubois.106.d: "Our zoo is enriched by a new, fascinating animal: today the long-awaited #O Alligator#! moved into its new enclosure."
 dubois.106.f: "American alligators are apex predators and consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They play an important role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, American alligators bellow to declare territory, and locate suitable mates. During the 19th and 20th centuries, larger males reaching 5 to 6 m were reported. The largest reported individual size was a male killed in 1890 on Marsh Island, Louisiana, and reportedly measured at 5.84 m in length, but no voucher specimen was available, since the American alligator was left on a muddy bank after having been measured due to having been too massive to relocate."

 dubois.107.f: "The axolotl is an aquatic Mexican tailed amphibian from the family of transverse-toothed newts, which occurs naturally only as permanent larvae. Axolotls reach sexual maturity without changing their external larval form and without undergoing a metamorphosis that is otherwise common in amphibians. In August 1804, Alexander von Humboldt was the first to bring axolotls to Europe, which - preserved in alcohol - served as an exotic curiosity in the Paris Museum of Natural History. Axolotls have the ability to restore limbs, organs, and even parts of the brain and heart. The regenerates are usually not crippled, but complete and functional. The ability to regenerate makes the species a worthwhile research object."

 dubois.111.f: "The brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) is a species of three-toed sloth found in the Neotropical realm of Central and South America. Brown-throated sloths sleep 15 to 18 hours every day and are active for only brief periods of time, which may be during either the day or night. Although they can walk along the ground, and even swim, they spend most of their lives in the high branches of trees, descending once every eight days or so to defecate in the soil. They do not travel far, with home ranges of only around 0.5 to 9 ha (1.2 to 22.2 acres), depending on the local environment. Within a typical, 5-hectare (12-acre) range, a brown-throated sloth will visit around 40 trees, and may specialise on one particular species, even spending up to 20% of its time in a single specific tree."

With a body length of up to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) and a weight of up to 158 kg (348 lb), it is the largest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the world. Its distinctively marked coat features pale yellow to tan colored fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides, although a melanistic black coat appears in some individuals. The jaguar's powerful bite allows it to pierce the carapaces of turtles and tortoises, and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of mammalian prey between the ears to deliver a fatal blow to the brain. The word 'jaguar' is possibly derived from the Tupi-Guarani word yaguara meaning 'wild beast that overcomes its prey at a bound'."

It is one of four living species of anteaters, of which it is the largest member. It feeds primarily on ants and termites, using its fore claws to dig them up and its long, sticky tongue to collect them. Though giant anteaters live in overlapping home ranges, they are mostly solitary except during mother-offspring relationships, aggressive interactions between males, and when mating. The giant anteater is the most terrestrial of the living anteater species. Its ancestors may originally have been adapted to arboreal life."

Its ancestors originated in South America, and remained there until the formation of the Isthmus of Panama allowed them to enter North America as part of the Great American Interchange. The nine-banded armadillo is a solitary, mainly nocturnal animal, found in many kinds of habitats, from mature and secondary rainforests to grassland and dry scrub. The outer shell is composed of ossified dermal scutes covered by nonoverlapping, keratinized epidermal scales, which are connected by flexible bands of skin.

Found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan. It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. The Andean condor is a national symbol of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions."

Living alone or in herds, it feeds on underwater plants and uses its whiskers to navigate. Since manatees are mammals, they breathe air, have warm blood, and produce milk. The West Indian manatee has a prehensile snout, like their relative the elephant, for grabbing vegetation and bringing it into their mouths. Because manatees evolved in habitats without natural predators, they lack predator avoidance behavior. The large size and low metabolic rates of manatees lends to their capacity for long and deep dives, as well as their relative lack of speed."

These relatively small primates are native to Central and South America and live in large groups that can number 12 to 100 individuals. Groups are composed of numerous males and females as well as the common young animals. They have a social structure that is unusual for apes: the group is built around the females, who develop a fixed hierarchy. The males often only stay at the edge of the group. Group members communicate by whistling and cackling. Squirrel monkeys feed mainly on insects and fruit, the proportion of which can vary depending on the season. Hunting insects takes up most of the day (up to 50% of the day), eating the fruit only around 10%."

The Iberian lynx has a short bright yellowish to tawny coloured spotted fur. The spots vary in shape and size from small round to elongate. They are arranged in lines and decrease in size from the back towards the sides. At the ends of the small, triangular ears there are brush hairs that are three centimeters long. As with the Eurasian lynx, they are important for the hearing ability of these lynxes. In the case of the Iberian lynx, experiments have shown that the loss of the brush reduces the ability to hear and locate. Iberian lynx are much smaller than the Eurasian lynx, which is more widespread in the north. With a body weight of between 9 and 15 kilograms, they weigh less than two thirds of a Eurasian lynx."

The name ermine is used for species in the genus Mustela, especially the stoat, in its pure white winter coat, or the fur thereof. The stoat is similar to the least weasel in general proportions, manner of posture, and movement, though the tail is relatively longer, always exceeding a third of the body length, though it is shorter than that of the long-tailed weasel. As with the least weasel, mouse-like rodents predominate in the stoat's diet. However, unlike the least weasel, which almost exclusively feeds on small voles, the stoat regularly preys on larger rodent and lagomorph species, and will take down individuals far larger than itself."

 dubois.125.f: "The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) is a semiaquatic mammal native to Eurasia. The Eurasian otter has a diet mainly of fish, and is strongly territorial. As with various other mustelid species, otters are capable of overpowering and killing prey significantly larger than themselves, and are known to hunt large waterbirds such as adult greylag geese on occasion. Due to the unusual structure of its hair, the fur of the otter offers particularly effective insulation against cold and wet: like a zipper, the hair is interlocked with microscopically small, interlocking wedges and grooves. An extraordinarily dense fur braid is created, which traps insulating air bubbles, but at the same time repels water. This keeps the otter's skin dry and its body warm."

It is a sexually dimorphic species: males are larger and carry longer, curved horns than females. Its coat colour is typically brownish grey. Alpine ibex tend to live in steep, rough terrain near the snow line. They are also social, although adult males and females segregate for most of the year, coming together only to mate. Alpine ibex are strictly herbivorous, with over half of their diet consisting of grasses, and the remainder being a mixture of mosses, flowers, leaves, and twigs. The Alpine ibex historically ranged through France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Bavaria, Austria and Slovenia. Starting in the early 16th century and with firearms becoming common, the overall population declined due to overexploitation and poaching."

Their habitat is temperate deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests. Wisents are herd animals, but according to their habitat they are only found in small groups. Since the extinction of the aurochs, the bison has been Europe's heaviest and largest land mammal and also the last representative of the wild bovine species on the European continent. In prehistory and early history, its distribution area stretched from the north of the Iberian Peninsula across Central Europe and the south of the Scandinavian Peninsula to the Baltic States; from the Bay of Riga the distribution limit ran south-east to the Black Sea and the Caucasus. In the 1920s the wisent was threatened with extinction; the last free-living wisent (a mountain wisent) was shot in 1927 in the Caucasus.

After elephants and rhinos, the hippopotamus is the next largest land mammal. It is also the largest extant land artiodactyl. Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps. Territorial bulls each preside over a stretch of water and a group of five to thirty cows and calves. During the day, hippos remain cool by staying in water or mud, emerging at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos typically do not display territorial behaviour on land. Hippos are among the most dangerous animals in the world due to their aggressive and unpredictable nature."

It is the largest living terrestrial animal, with bulls reaching a shoulder height of up to 3.96 m (13 ft 0 in) and a body mass of up to 10.4 t (11.5 short tons). It is a social mammal, travelling in herds composed of cows and their offspring. The African bush elephant has grey skin with scanty hairs. Its large ears cover the whole shoulder and help to reduce body heat; flapping them creates air currents and exposes large blood vessels on the inner sides to increase heat loss during hot weather. Africa bush elephants use their trunks for tactile communication. When greeting, a lower ranking individual will insert the tip of its trunk into its superior's mouth. Elephants will also stretch out their trunk toward an approaching individual they intend to greet."

All representatives of the zebras are found exclusively in Africa, where they mostly inhabit open landscapes. There are several attempts to explain the evolutionary development of the stripes; a combination of several advantageous effects is also conceivable. On the one hand, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, among others, suspected that they could act as camouflage in tall grass or in hot, shimmering air. Because zebras live in herds, this could make it harder for predators to single out prey. According to another hypothesis tested experimentally, the stripes formed to camouflage against tsetse flies and horseflies. Other scientists suspect that the strips are used for thermoregulation."

The name 'giant panda' is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas are generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. The low nutrition quality of bamboo means pandas need to eat more frequently, and due to their lack of major predators they can be active at any time of the day."

It is easily identified by its markings, most notably the light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its hindquarters. It is covered in black hair, except for the tips of its ears, which, as with other tapirs, are rimmed with white. The pattern is for camouflage; the disrupted coloration breaks up its outline and makes it more difficult to recognize; other animals may mistake it for a large rock, rather than prey, when it is lying down to sleep.

 dubois.153.f: "The red kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) is the largest of all kangaroos, the largest terrestrial mammal native to Australia, and the largest extant marsupial. This species is a very large kangaroo with long, pointed ears and a square shaped muzzle. They are sexually dimorphic as the males have short, red-brown fur, fading to pale buff below and on the limbs. Males grow up to a head-and-body length of 1.3-1.6 m (4 ft 3 in to 5 ft 3 in) with a tail that adds a further 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) to the total length and are referred to by Australians as 'Big Reds'. The red kangaroo's legs work much like a rubber band, with the Achilles tendon stretching as the animal comes down, then releasing its energy to propel the animal up and forward, enabling the characteristic bouncing locomotion. They can reach speeds of around 60 km/h (37 mph)."

 dubois.154.d: "Our zoo is enriched by a new, exceptional animal: today the long-awaited #O Koala#! moved into its new enclosure."
 dubois.154.f: "The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxins that deter most other mammals from feeding on it. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala along with the kangaroos are recognised worldwide as symbols of Australia."

 dubois.155.d: "Our zoo is enriched by a new, exceptional animal: today the long-awaited #O Platypus#! moved into its new enclosure."
 dubois.155.f: "The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is one of the five extant species of monotremes, mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Like other monotremes, it senses prey through electrolocation. It is one of the few species of venomous mammals, as the male platypus has a spur on the hind foot that delivers a venom, capable of causing severe pain to humans. The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it. In 1799, the first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body judged it a fake, made of several animals sewn together. The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology, and a recognisable and iconic symbol of Australia."

The most common, the southern cassowary, is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller only than the ostrich and emu. Around 90% of the Cassowary diet consists of mainly fruit, although all species are opportunistic omnivores. Typically, all cassowaries are shy birds that are found in the deep forest. They are adept at disappearing long before a human knows they were there, but if provoked, they are capable of inflicting serious, even fatal, injuries to both dogs and people. The cassowary has often been labeled 'the world's most dangerous bird'."

 dubois.157.f: "The New Zealand sea lion is a large eared seal native to the sub-polar zone. The bulls are black-brown in color and reach heights of 2.45 meters; a shoulder mane makes them appear massive. The cows are more delicate: they are light brown and at most 2 meters long. The colonies are found in southern New Zealand on the sub-Antarctic islands: the Auckland Islands, the Snares Islands and Campbell Island. 95 percent of the world stocks are found in three colonies on the Auckland Islands. In the 19th century, many sea lions were killed by sealers. The sea lions of the Auckland Islands were completely wiped out in just twenty years after the islands were discovered in 1806. Today, the Auckland Islands are a deserted seal sanctuary where populations have largely recovered."

The National Museum, which had previously housed natural history, had resisted this move along with its leadership. For many, natural history was merely a subordinate department. It was thanks to Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_paleontologist_scope').GetLastName] that he used his contacts in the government and pursued his idea without compromise. Especially paleontological research will benefit from this in the future, and visitors have already expressed their great interest in extinct creatures, as well as asking questions about the origin of man. Paleontology, formerly a purely ancillary science or temporary occupation of geologists, has now become an established science with its own institutions and a reputation that puts it on a par with other natural sciences."

 dubois.202.f: "Apart from vertebrae, fossil shark teeth are usually the only surviving fossils of extinct sharks. Since sharks produce a large number of teeth because of their revolver teeth, these are among the most frequently found fossils. As early as 1616, Fabio Colonna was able to show in his treatise De Glossopetris Dissertatio that the supposed viper tongues are in fact shark teeth. Squalicorax pristodontus had flat, triangular teeth, up to a maximum of three centimeters long. The cutting edges were finely serrated like today in the tiger shark. In the Cretaceous period, the genus Squalicorax was distributed worldwide. Fossilized teeth have been found in Mesozoic sediments in the Americas, Africa, Japan, Australia, India, Russia, the Middle East and Europe."

However, he showed little understanding for the alleged dinosaur footprints. In fact, [SCOPE.sCharacter('pb_leader').GetFullName] explained that he couldn't see anything special in the strange indentations. The political leader's philistinism prompted a full-blown argument with the professor, who demanded an apology on the spot.

 dubois.204.f: "Palaeosinopa is a genus of mammals in the Pantolestidae family, now extinct. The animals resembled today's insectivores and lived from the Upper Paleocene to the Lower Eocene 59 to 48 million years ago. Evidence is mainly known from North America, more rarely from Europe. Important finds, including some complete skeletons, come from the north-west of the USA. The fossil butte member of the Green River Formation with an age of about 52 million years and the stratigraphically somewhat older Willwood Formation are particularly outstanding. Representatives of Palaeosinopa were characterized by a robust physique and a long tail. The shorter front legs compared to the longer hind legs appeared rather primitive. Due to the physique, a semi-aquatic way of life is reconstructed for the animals, the structure of the teeth in turn speaks for predominantly animal food. As a result, Palaeosinopa seems to have inhabited a habitat similar to that of today's otters."

 dubois.205.f: "Not everyone was as enthusiastic about the bone find in the mine as the paleontologist who had been summoned. Mine management was concerned that a paleontological dig could interfere with the work. And indeed, after a brief inspection of the finds, Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_paleontologist_scope').GetLastName] should determine that the work in the shaft would have to be postponed in favor of a professional scientific excavation. The industrialists have already protested. The fossil find thus becomes a political issue. Because the intelligentsia is now also highly interested and insists on excavating the fossils. Mediating voices are considering avoiding an excavation and just keeping records, which would not affect the mining work and might be a good political compromise, but would mean that we would not be able to salvage the fossils ourselves."

 dubois.206.f: "Composita is an extinct brachiopod genus that lived from the Late Devonian to the Late Permian. Composita had a cosmopolitan global distribution, having lived on every continent except Antarctica.Composita had a smooth shell with a more or less distinct fold and sulcus and a round opening for the pedicle on the pedicle valve. Composita is included in the family Athyrididae (Order Athyridida) and placed in the subfamily Spirigerellinae. Only philistines would recognize a mere shell in this time-honoured fossil."

 dubois.207.f: "The trilobites are an extinct class of marine arthropods. They existed for almost the entire span of the Paleozoic, from the 2nd series of the Cambrian (starting 521 million years ago) to the mass extinction event at the end of the Permian, about 251 million years ago. Large numbers of their exoskeletons, reinforced with calcite (calcium carbonate), have been preserved as fossils, making it possible to reconstruct the evolution and variety of forms of the numerous species. This, combined with their stratigraphic persistence and wide geographical range, makes trilobites important index fossils for the Paleozoic, particularly the Cambrian. The extinct class of Trilobita consists of nine recognized orders, over 150 families, over 5000 genera, and more than 15,000 described species."

 dubois.208.f: "The ammonites (Ammonoidea) are an extinct subgroup of cephalopods. This taxon was very diverse with over 1500 known genera. The number of species may have been around 30,000 to 40,000. The size of the shell of adult animals is usually in the range of 1 to 30 cm. From their first appearance in the Lower Devonian to their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous (Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary), ammonites represent a large number of index fossils over a period of about 350 million years; in part, the chronological delimitation of marine sediments is carried out exclusively on the basis of ammonites. They are therefore of great importance for geology and paleontology. The taxon Ammonoidea was first mentioned in 1884 by Karl Alfred von Zittel in his Handbook on Paleontology. The name comes from antiquity, Pliny the Elder referred to fossils as 'Ammonis cornua' (Ammon's horns)."

 dubois.209.f: "In the Carboniferous (about 360-300 million years ago), ferns (in larger forms than today, usually called tree ferns) together with horsetail and lycopod plants formed huge forests and created the basis for most of today's coal deposits. The oldest fossil finds are from the Lower Devonian (about 400 million years ago). Ferns are thus probably older than the seed plants, which first appeared in the Upper Devonian."

The first scientifically recognized dinosaur egg fossils were discovered serendipitously in 1923 by an American Museum of Natural History crew while looking for evidence of early humans in Mongolia. These eggs were mistakenly attributed to the locally abundant herbivore Protoceratops, but are now known to be Oviraptor eggs.

The muzzle was shorter and deeper than that of a bull-dog. The teeth were all sharp cylindric fangs, smooth and glistening, and of irregular size. At certain distance in each jaw they projected three inches above the gum, and were sunk one inch into the jaw margin, being thus as long as the fangs of a tiger, but more slender. Two such fangs crossed each other on each side of the middle of the front. Besides the smaller fishes, the reptiles no doubt supplied the demands of his appetite.' -Edward Drinker Cope"

He must be something of an engineer in order to be able to handle large masses of stone and transport them over roadless wastes of desert to the nearest shipping point; he must have a delicate and skilful touch to preserve the least fragments of bone when fractured; he must be content with very plain living, because the profession is seldom, if ever, remunerative, and he is almost invariably underpaid; he must find his chief reward and stimulus in the sense of discovery and in the despatching of specimens to museums which he has never seen for the benefit of a public which has little knowledge or appreciation of the self-sacrifices which the fossil hunter has made.' -Henry Fairfield Osborn"

It is considered a prime example of original representatives of the Tetrapodomorpha. Since Eusthenopteron possessed a lung-swimming-bladder-organ and a powerful fin skeleton in addition to the gills, it could have been possible for it to move briefly outside of water.

It is native to the shallow waters, such as oxbows and bayous, of the Amazon basin. It was named after the British Queen Victoria. The submerged petiole is 7 to 8 meters long. The floating leaves have a rim about 6 cm high, which has two opposite incisions. These incisions ensure that the edge of the sheet does not tear during heavy movement and that excess water can drain off easily after heavy rainfall.

Here, in just a few days, he processed early sketches for the Carnaval, which date from a time when he was working as a teacher at a private music school in Paris, commissioned by Aristide Dietsch (1861/1865). When musical parodies were on the curriculum there, Saint-Saëns was persuaded by his students to realize one of his many ideas for a humorous piece of music. However, concerned about his reputation, Saint-Saëns decided not to publish the work for chamber orchestra. Because apart from the fact that the composer imitated animal calls through the instruments in the pieces, he had parodied several of his professional colleagues. Although the composers were dead by then, Saint-Saëns did not want to upset their admirers. The work was only published posthumously by its publisher Jacques Durand."

 dubois.1012.f1: "The Hippopotami were floating in the water in their enclosure. Not a lot was happening. You wondered if they ever did anything when a zookeeper appeared next to you.\n\n\"It is so fascinating how the Hippos usually just float around during the day. But after dusk they become very active and start to forage. But it's obvious if you know how hot it is in their natural habitat. The water cools them during the day and in the evening and night they can finally start roaming around.\""
 dubois.1012.f2: "Suddenly a Hippo emerged from the water. You haven't seen that one before, even though you were watching the enclosure for multiple minutes. It must have been in the water for quite some time.\n\nA person next to you started speaking: \"Isn't it fascinating? Those Hippos can stay under water for five minutes. When they submerge, their nostrils and ears are shut, so no water can enter.\""
 dubois.1012.f3: "One of the Hippopotami opened its huge mouth and showed its long, curved teeth. Then it started grunting and splashing.\n\nYou once read that male Hippos do this to warn off rivals, as they are very protective of their territory. Male Hippos use their feces to mark specific points in their territory as well. Someties they even stare at other male hippos as a form of dominance."

 dubois.1013.t: "Lion Enclosure"
 dubois.1013.d: "A pack of #o Lions#! can be found in the lion enclosure. The enclosure features a tree for shade and a small pond for drinking."
 dubois.1013.f1: "The magnificent lions was laying in the middle of its pride. The mane of the male lion was big and quite dark. Suddenly the lion yawned and showed its teeth.\n\nApparently the mane of the male lions grows longer and longer reaching up to 16 cm. The older the lion gets, the darker its mane becomes. The mane probably has two main purposes: To attract females and to pretect the lion's throat and neck during fights. The thickness of the mane depends on the temperatures in the lion's habitat. In colder regions the manes are far heavier for lions living in zoos in Europe and North America."
 dubois.1013.f2: "At first it was only one Lion roaring but then the others joined in. With each Lion the roaring got louder and louder. Then, suddenly, they stopped all at once.\n\nLions usually live in prides of related animals. The majority of the females stay in the same pride their entire life, while the males usually join other prides or coalitions of other male lions. In the pride the females are usually the hunters having a way higher chance of catching prey. The males have about a 10% chance of actually catching their prey. But when they catch a big animal, lions can eat up to 40 kg of meat."
 dubois.1013.f3: "In the confines of a zoo, the mighty lion paces back and forth within its enclosure. Its muscular body exudes power and grace as it surveys its surroundings. The lion's restless movements catch your attention, prompting you to ponder the secrets behind its behavior. As you ponder, a knowledgeable zookeeper approaches, ready to share insights about these magnificent creatures.\n\n\"It's fascinating to observe the lions in their enclosure,\" the zookeeper begins. \"During the day, they often engage in repetitive pacing, a behavior that can be seen both in captive lions and their wild counterparts. This pacing is believed to be a result of their natural instinct to patrol and mark their territory, even in the absence of vast grasslands or expansive landscapes.\""
 dubois.1013.f4: "At the zoo, [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_prinz_eugen').GetFullName] is known for checking on the old lion in the enclosure every day. The veteran feels a deep connection to the animal. Both seem like witnesses to times past of glory and honor. Zoo visitors say there is a bond between this specific animal and the man.\n\nBut finally three days came when the lion no longer saw his master, he refused to eat anything and paced restlessly up and down in the enclosure. At around three in the morning he let out such a roar that the animal keeper ran out into the enclosure to see. At the same time he heard the death knell ring in the chapel and so he knew that his master, the great General [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_prinz_eugen').GetLastName], had died at that very hour. It's the stuff that touches even the hardest hearts of soldiers."
  
 dubois.1014.t: "Elephant Enclosure"
 dubois.1014.d: "In a vast enclosure the Elephants are roaming around. They are one of the biggest attractions of the Zoo and there are always people watching them."
 dubois.1014.f1: "You were observing the Elephants for quite some time. One of them stroke out to you. It was a huge female Elephant with long tusks. She seemed to take the lead sometimes and the other Elephants seemed to respect her a lot.\n\n\"I see you found the Matriarch of the Elephants!\", you didn't even notice that a zookeeper was standing next to you, \""These majestic creatures live in tight-knit family units known as herds. Within the herd, you'll often find a matriarch, a wise and experienced female who leads and protects the group. In their family, the Elephants have strong social bonds. They even mourn the loss of one of their group. Luckily we didn't have an Elephant death in years!\""
 dubois.1014.f2: "One of the Elephants was trumpeting. It sounded great! You would probably even have heard it from hundreds of meters away.\n\nIt reminded you of a text you once read about elephants: "One of the Elephants was trumpeting. It sounded great! You would probably even have heard it from hundreds of meters away.\n\nIt reminded you of a text you once read about elephants: "African elephants possess an incredible ability to communicate over long distances. Through a variety of vocalizations, such as trumpets, rumbles, and roars, they convey information to other members of their herd, whether it's a warning of danger or a call to regroup.\""
 dubois.1014.f3: "One of the Elephants came closer to you. Its trunk slowly approached you. Wasn't that the Elephant you fed some food a year ago? No, that couldn't be. It would have forgotten you by now! Nonetheless you gave the elephant a fruit you brought for yourself.\n\n\"I think she remembers you.\", a zookeeper was standing next to you, \"Elephants can remember things over years, even decades. It's fascinating, sometimes they remember a visitor and act accordingly. Once an Elephant took some woman's purse because she threw a stone at the Elephant as a child. They have an astonishing recall of locations, water sources, and even individuals they have encountered. This remarkable memory helps them navigate their environment and maintain strong social connections.\""
  
 dubois.1015.t: "Giraffe Enclosure"
 dubois.1015.d: "The Giraffes were visible from far away. Their heads reached high above the ground to get some fresh leaves from the trees."
 dubois.1015.f1: "The giraffe's blue tongue curled around the green branches in your hand. In the process, the tongue slid over your hand. It was rough and very long.\n\nYou remember something that you once read in a book: The giraffe's tongue was perfectly adapted to its environment. It was designed to graze the acacia leaves from the branch without getting hurt by the thorns. To eat the 30 kilograms of leaves per day, the giraffe has to tear leaves from the trees for up to 12 hours. At the same time, the leaves also cover a large part of the giraffe's water needs."
 dubois.1015.f2: "Two of the Giraffes stood side by side when they suddenly started to hit each others sides with their heads. Their long neck allowed them to fling their head and aim for their opponent. What could cause such savage behaviour?\n\n\"Don't be afraid! This is a natural behaviour.\", a zookeeper stood next to you and started to explain, \"Giraffes are social animals that form loose-knit herds. These herds are often composed of females and their young, with occasional bachelor groups of young males. Within the herd, giraffes engage in various forms of social interaction, including necking, a behavior where males engage in gentle sparring to establish dominance or gain mating rights. That's exactly what you just saw!\""
 dubois.1015.f3: "You listened to a zookeeper talking about the Giraffes with a group of people: \"Giraffes have a distinct coat pattern that resembles a mosaic of irregular patches. These patterns, which vary among individuals, help Giraffes camouflage themselves within their surroundings, providing them with a measure of protection against predators. Apart from that the lighter stripes help the Giraffe to cool down. If they only had dark hair, they would overheat in the savannah.\""
  
 dubois.1016.t: "African Penguin Enclosure"
 dubois.1016.d: "Some Penguins were swiming in the water, others were standing together, one was waggling with its wings."
 dubois.1016.f1: "In the bustling penguin exhibit of the zoo, a lively colony of African Penguins waddles and frolics in the water. Their sleek black and white plumage glistens under the sunlight, drawing the attention of visitors. Mesmerized by their playful antics, you approach a nearby zookeeper, eager to learn more about these charismatic creatures.\n\n\"The African Penguin, also known as the Jackass Penguin due to its donkey-like braying call, is a remarkable species," the zookeeper begins. "These penguins are endemic to the coastlines of Southern Africa, specifically found in the waters surrounding Namibia and South Africa. Unlike their counterparts in Antarctica, African Penguins thrive in a warmer climate, making them well-suited to the coastal regions they call home.\""
 dubois.1016.f2: "You watch as a penguin struggles with a rock. Parts of the rock fly away, so it must be soft rock. You watch with interest as the penguin continues to dig.\n\nDidn't you read something about that? The African penguins dig a nesting cave in guano deposits. This guano comes from the droppings of hundreds of generations of birds. In South Africa there are large deposits of guano where the penguins nest. Thereby the partners take turns in breeding."
 dubois.1016.f3: "As you marvel at the penguins' playful splashes in the water, a zookeeper shares a fascinating detail: \"One unique characteristic of African Penguins is their exceptional swimming ability. They are agile and streamlined underwater, relying on their flippers to propel themselves through the ocean in search of small fish and squid, which make up the majority of their diet. Their waterproof feathers and dense layer of blubber provide insulation, allowing them to withstand the cold ocean temperatures.\""

 dubois.1017.t: "Naked Mole-Rat Enclosure"
 dubois.1017.d: "As an animal that was mostly underground, the enclosure of the Naked-Mole Rat was mostly just a pile of dirt. But through itelligent use of glass it was possible to actually look at the small animals in their dwellings."
 dubois.1017.f1: "Within the fascinating underground habitat of the zoo, a unique and industrious creature known as the Naked Mole-Rat scurries through its intricate tunnels, its hairless and wrinkled appearance capturing the attention of visitors. Intrigued by its subterranean lifestyle, you approach a knowledgeable zookeeper, eager to learn more about this intriguing mammal.\n\n"The Naked Mole-Rat is a true marvel of adaptation," the zookeeper begins. "These remarkable rodents are highly specialized for life in dark, underground environments. Their lack of fur is an advantage, as it prevents dirt and debris from sticking to their skin as they dig. With their sharp teeth and powerful jaws, Naked Mole-Rats are skilled diggers, creating elaborate tunnel systems that provide protection, food storage, and social structures.""
 dubois.1017.f2: "In the captivating underground burrows of the zoo, a colony of Naked Mole-Rats works harmoniously, each individual contributing to the tasks of digging, foraging, and caring for the young. The sight of their communal activities captivates the attention of visitors. Intrigued by their social dynamics, you seek out a knowledgeable zookeeper, hoping to uncover more about the lives of these fascinating rodents.\n\n"Naked Mole-Rats are highly social creatures," the zookeeper explains. "They live in colonies with a complex social structure, similar to that of honeybees or ants. Within a colony, there is a single breeding female, known as the queen, who is responsible for giving birth to the majority of the young. The rest of the colony is made up of non-breeding individuals, known as workers, who contribute to tasks such as tunneling, foraging, and caring for the young.""
 dubois.1017.f3: "Amidst the intricate tunnels of the mole-rat habitat, a group of Naked Mole-Rats huddle together, their wrinkled bodies entwined as they share warmth and engage in social grooming. Intrigued by their communal behavior, you approach a knowledgeable zookeeper, hoping to understand the significance of their interactions.\n\n"The communal behaviors of Naked Mole-Rats are truly fascinating," the zookeeper shares. "Their huddling behavior serves multiple purposes, including maintaining body temperature and fostering social bonds. These rodents are known to engage in social grooming, which not only helps with hygiene but also reinforces social connections within the colony. Their complex social interactions are a testament to the cooperative and interconnected nature of mole-rat colonies.""

 dubois.1018.t: "Zebra Enclosure"
 dubois.1018.d: "The Zebra Eclosure was quite flat, full of grass and had some lone trees in it that offered shade. It looked a little bit like Africa."
 dubois.1018.f1: "Within the vibrant savannah-themed enclosure of the zoo, a group of captivating and striped creatures known as Zebras graze peacefully, their black and white patterns creating a mesmerizing visual display against the backdrop of the grasslands. Intrigued by their striking appearance, you approach a knowledgeable zookeeper, eager to learn more about these iconic African animals.\n\n"Zebras are not only known for their unique black and white stripes but also for their fascinating behaviors and social dynamics," the zookeeper begins. "These stripes serve as a form of camouflage, helping them blend into the grasslands and confusing predators. Zebras are highly social animals, often found in family groups known as harems. Their cooperative behaviors, such as grooming and watchfulness, contribute to the safety and well-being of the group.""
 dubois.1018.f2: "In the serene savannah habitat of the zoo, a male Zebra asserts his dominance by engaging in a spirited display of kicking and posturing, his mane and tail swaying with each movement. The sight of his behavior captivates the attention of visitors. Intrigued by his actions, you seek out a knowledgeable zookeeper, hoping to uncover more about the social behaviors of these charismatic African animals.\n\n"Zebra behavior often involves fascinating displays of dominance and communication," the zookeeper explains. "Male Zebras establish their hierarchy within a group through various behaviors, such as vocalizations, posturing, and physical interactions. They also have unique ways of communicating with each other, including braying sounds and high-pitched whinnies. These behaviors play a crucial role in maintaining the social order within a Zebra harem.""
 dubois.1018.f3: "Amidst the sprawling savannah landscape of the Zebra habitat, a young foal frolics and races around its mother, its playful behavior capturing the essence of youthful exuberance. Intrigued by the interaction, you approach a knowledgeable zookeeper, hoping to understand the significance of the foal's behavior.\n\n"The energetic behaviors of Zebra foals are truly captivating," the zookeeper shares. "Foals are known for their playfulness, which serves important developmental purposes. Play allows them to practice physical skills, develop social bonds, and learn from their interactions with the adults in the group. Through these playful behaviors, foals gradually gain the skills they need to thrive in the wild.""
