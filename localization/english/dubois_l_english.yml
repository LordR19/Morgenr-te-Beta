 dubois.1012.t: "Hippopotamus Enclosure"
 dubois.1012.d: "The #o Hippopotamus#! Enclosure harbors a bunch of these huge creatures. Thankfully, they are seperated from the visitors by a big moat."
 dubois.1012.f1: "The Hippopotami were floating in the water in their enclosure. Not a lot was happening. You wondered if they ever did anything when a zookeeper appeared next to you.\n\n\"It is so fascinating how the Hippos usually just float around during the day. But after dusk they become very active and start to forage. But it's obvious if you know how hot it is in their natural habitat. The water cools them during the day and in the evening and night they can finally start roaming around.\""
 dubois.1012.f2: "Suddenly a Hippo emerged from the water. You haven't seen that one before, even though you were watching the enclosure for multiple minutes. It must have been in the water for quite some time.\n\nA person next to you started speaking: \"Isn't it fascinating? Those Hippos can stay under water for five minutes. When they submerge, their nostrils and ears are shut, so no water can enter.\""
 dubois.1012.f3: "One of the Hippopotami opened its huge mouth and showed its long, curved teeth. Then it started grunting and splashing.\n\nYou once read that male Hippos do this to warn off rivals, as they are very protective of their territory. Male Hippos use their feces to mark specific points in their territory as well. Someties they even stare at other male hippos as a form of dominance."
 dubois.1012.k: "Return to the African Enclosures"
 zoo_african_enclosures_tt: "You will return to the African Enclosures of the Zoo."

 dubois.1013.t: "Lion Enclosure"
 dubois.1013.d: "A pack of #o Lions#! can be found in the lion enclosure. The enclosure features a tree for shade and a small pond for drinking."
 dubois.1013.f1: "The magnificent lions was laying in the middle of its pride. The mane of the male lion was big and quite dark. Suddenly the lion yawned and showed its teeth.\n\nApparently the mane of the male lions grows longer and longer reaching up to 16 cm. The older the lion gets, the darker its mane becomes. The mane probably has two main purposes: To attract females and to pretect the lion's throat and neck during fights. The thickness of the mane depends on the temperatures in the lion's habitat. In colder regions the manes are far heavier for lions living in zoos in Europe and North America."
 dubois.1013.f2: "At first it was only one Lion roaring but then the others joined in. With each Lion the roaring got louder and louder. Then, suddenly, they stopped all at once.\n\nLions usually live in prides of related animals. The majority of the females stay in the same pride their entire life, while the males usually join other prides or coalitions of other male lions. In the pride the females are usually the hunters having a way higher chance of catching prey. The males have about a 10% chance of actually catching their prey. But when they catch a big animal, lions can eat up to 40 kg of meat."
 dubois.1013.f3: "In the confines of a zoo, the mighty lion paces back and forth within its enclosure. Its muscular body exudes power and grace as it surveys its surroundings. The lion's restless movements catch your attention, prompting you to ponder the secrets behind its behavior. As you ponder, a knowledgeable zookeeper approaches, ready to share insights about these magnificent creatures.\n\n\"It's fascinating to observe the lions in their enclosure,\" the zookeeper begins. \"During the day, they often engage in repetitive pacing, a behavior that can be seen both in captive lions and their wild counterparts. This pacing is believed to be a result of their natural instinct to patrol and mark their territory, even in the absence of vast grasslands or expansive landscapes.\""

 dubois.1014.t: "Elephant Enclosure"
 dubois.1014.d: "In a vast enclosure the Elephants are roaming around. They are one of the biggest attractions of the Zoo and there are always people watching them."
 dubois.1014.f1: "You were observing the Elephants for quite some time. One of them stroke out to you. It was a huge female Elephant with long tusks. She seemed to take the lead sometimes and the other Elephants seemed to respect her a lot.\n\n\"I see you found the Matriarch of the Elephants!\", you didn't even notice that a zookeeper was standing next to you, \""These majestic creatures live in tight-knit family units known as herds. Within the herd, you'll often find a matriarch, a wise and experienced female who leads and protects the group. In their family, the Elephants have strong social bonds. They even mourn the loss of one of their group. Luckily we didn't have an Elephant death in years!\""
 dubois.1014.f2: "One of the Elephants was trumpeting. It sounded great! You would probably even have heard it from hundreds of meters away.\n\nIt reminded you of a text you once read about elephants: "African elephants possess an incredible ability to communicate over long distances. Through a variety of vocalizations, such as trumpets, rumbles, and roars, they convey information to other members of their herd, whether it's a warning of danger or a call to regroup.\""
 dubois.1014.f3: "One of the Elephants came closer to you. Its trunk slowly approached you. Wasn't that the Elephant you fed some food a year ago? No, that couldn't be. It would have forgotten you by now! Nonetheless you gave the elephant a fruit you brought for yourself.\n\n\"I think she remembers you.\", a zookeeper was standing next to you, \"Elephants can remember things over years, even decades. It's fascinating, sometimes they remember a visitor and act accordingly. Once an Elephant took some woman's purse because she threw a stone at the Elephant as a child. They have an astonishing recall of locations, water sources, and even individuals they have encountered. This remarkable memory helps them navigate their environment and maintain strong social connections.\""

 dubois.1015.t: "Giraffe Enclosure"
 dubois.1015.d: "The Giraffes were visible from far away. Their heads reached high above the ground to get some fresh leaves from the trees."
 dubois.1015.f1: "The giraffe's blue tongue curled around the green branches in your hand. In the process, the tongue slid over your hand. It was rough and very long.\n\nYou remember something that you once read in a book: The giraffe's tongue was perfectly adapted to its environment. It was designed to graze the acacia leaves from the branch without getting hurt by the thorns. To eat the 30 kilograms of leaves per day, the giraffe has to tear leaves from the trees for up to 12 hours. At the same time, the leaves also cover a large part of the giraffe's water needs."
 dubois.1015.f2: "Two of the Giraffes stood side by side when they suddenly started to hit each others sides with their heads. Their long neck allowed them to fling their head and aim for their opponent. What could cause such savage behaviour?\n\n\"Don't be afraid! This is a natural behaviour.\", a zookeeper stood next to you and started to explain, \"Giraffes are social animals that form loose-knit herds. These herds are often composed of females and their young, with occasional bachelor groups of young males. Within the herd, giraffes engage in various forms of social interaction, including necking, a behavior where males engage in gentle sparring to establish dominance or gain mating rights. That's exactly what you just saw!\""
 dubois.1015.f3: "You listened to a zookeeper talking about the Giraffes with a group of people: \"Giraffes have a distinct coat pattern that resembles a mosaic of irregular patches. These patterns, which vary among individuals, help Giraffes camouflage themselves within their surroundings, providing them with a measure of protection against predators. Apart from that the lighter stripes help the Giraffe to cool down. If they only had dark hair, they would overheat in the savannah.\""

 dubois.1016.t: "African Penguin Enclosure"
 dubois.1016.d: "Some Penguins were swiming in the water, others were standing together, one was waggling with its wings."
 dubois.1016.f1: "In the bustling penguin exhibit of the zoo, a lively colony of African Penguins waddles and frolics in the water. Their sleek black and white plumage glistens under the sunlight, drawing the attention of visitors. Mesmerized by their playful antics, you approach a nearby zookeeper, eager to learn more about these charismatic creatures.\n\n\"The African Penguin, also known as the Jackass Penguin due to its donkey-like braying call, is a remarkable species," the zookeeper begins. "These penguins are endemic to the coastlines of Southern Africa, specifically found in the waters surrounding Namibia and South Africa. Unlike their counterparts in Antarctica, African Penguins thrive in a warmer climate, making them well-suited to the coastal regions they call home.\""
 dubois.1016.f2: "You watch as a penguin struggles with a rock. Parts of the rock fly away, so it must be soft rock. You watch with interest as the penguin continues to dig.\n\nDidn't you read something about that? The African penguins dig a nesting cave in guano deposits. This guano comes from the droppings of hundreds of generations of birds. In South Africa there are large deposits of guano where the penguins nest. Thereby the partners take turns in breeding."
 dubois.1016.f3: "As you marvel at the penguins' playful splashes in the water, a zookeeper shares a fascinating detail: \"One unique characteristic of African Penguins is their exceptional swimming ability. They are agile and streamlined underwater, relying on their flippers to propel themselves through the ocean in search of small fish and squid, which make up the majority of their diet. Their waterproof feathers and dense layer of blubber provide insulation, allowing them to withstand the cold ocean temperatures.\""
