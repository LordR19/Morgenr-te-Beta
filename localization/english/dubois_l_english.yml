 dubois_theory_of_evolution_tech: "Theory of Evolution"
 dubois_theory_of_evolution_tech_desc: "The crucial break from the concept of constant typological types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection. Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a 'struggle for existence' in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe."
 dubois_paleontology_tech: "Paleontology"
 dubois_paleontology_tech_desc: "An interest in the history of the earth and extinct animals can be traced back to antiquity and reached a first peak with the studies of Georges Cuvier around 1800. But the publication of the 'On the Origin of Species' was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of 'Origin' led to a concerted effort to look for transitional fossils and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record."

 je_dubois_safari: "Africa Safari"

It is purely coincidental which academic is available at the end - unless we specialize at a university in a particular area. The scientist will then come from this area. The time it takes to graduate depends on factors such as the literacy rate, investments in academic operations, and the expansion of institutions. A selected focus also increases the speed. If an academic comes from a field that is already occupied by another, he replaces his predecessor. So it's important to be careful who you promote."

 dubois.1.t: "Zoo Inauguration"
 dubois.1.d: "On the opening day of the new zoo, visitors flock to see the animals. Soon there was a desire to build even more enclosures and settle animals."
 dubois.1.f: "'Two nights ago I saw the tigers sup at Exeter Change. Except Veli Pacha's lion in  the Morea, who followed the Arab keeper like a dog, the fondness of the hyaena for her keeper amused me most. Such a conversazione! — There was a 'hippopotamus', like Lord Liverpool in the face; and the 'Ursine Sloth' hath the very voice and manner of my valet - but the tiger talked too much. The elephant took and gave me my money again - took off my hat, opened a door. trunked a whip, and behaved so well, that I wish he was my butler. The handsomest animal on earth is one of the panthers; but the poor antelopes were dead. I should hate to see one here: the sight of the camel made me pine again for Asia Minor.' -Lord Byron"
 dubois.1.g: "A new attraction in the capital!"
 dubois.2.t: "On the Origin of Species"
 dubois.2.d: "With the publication of his book, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] has made a groundbreaking scientific contribution: it aims to explain nothing less than the origin of species."
 dubois.2.f: "'Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring ... I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.' -Charles Darwin"
 dubois.2.g: "This theory will revolutionize science."
 dubois.2.h: "Once again, science has disproved religious superstitions."
 dubois.3.t: "Return of the Beagle"
 dubois.3.d: "The HMS Beagle has returned to England after a research voyage of several years. She has brought a rich fund of specimens, bones, drawings and other scientific results. Naturalist Charles Darwin was also on board."
 dubois.3.f: "'When on board HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species - that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.' - Charles Darwin"
 dubois.3.g: "An amazing journey - what kind of aftermath will it have?"
 dubois.4.t: "Kosmos"
 dubois.4.d: "Kosmos (usually referred to in English as 'Cosmos') was an influential treatise on science and nature written by the German scientist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt. Kosmos began as a lecture series delivered by Humboldt at the University of Berlin, and was published in five volumes between 1845 and 1862 (the fifth was posthumous and incomplete)."
 dubois.4.f: "'Late in the evening of a busy life, I am handing over to the German public a work whose vague image has hovered before my soul for almost half a century. In many moods I considered this work unworkable: and when I had given it up, I returned to it again, perhaps carelessly. I dedicate it to my contemporaries with the timidity that a just mistrust of the measure of my powers must inspire in me. I try to forget that long-awaited writings usually enjoy less indulgence.' -Alexander von Humboldt"
 dubois.4.g: "This work will serve contemporary science."
 dubois.4.h: "This work will inspire future generations."
 dubois.5.t: "Mendel's Heritage"
 dubois.5.d: "The rediscovery of the work of Abbot Gregor Mendel brought about a major breakthrough in the field of genetics. His theses already known as 'Mendel's rules'."
 dubois.5.f: "'Experience of artificial fertilisation, such as is effected with ornamental plants in order to obtain new variations in colour, has led to the experiments which will here be discussed. The striking-regularity with which the same hybrid forms always reappeared whenever fertilisation took place between the same species induced further experiments to be undertaken, the object of which was to follow up the developments of the hybrids in their progeny.' -Gregor Mendel"
 dubois.5.g: "The Birth of Modern Genetics."
 dubois.6.t: "The Java Man"
 dubois.6.d: "The Dutch doctor and anatomist [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_new_paleontologist_scope').GetFullName] caused a scientific sensation in his targeted search for the ancestors of man. He discovered the skeleton of a prehistoric man who lived a million years ago."
 dubois.6.f: "The fossils first discovered by [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_new_paleontologist_scope').GetFullName] in 1891 on the banks of the Solo River near Trinil in East Java are called Java Man. According to current knowledge, they are said to be around one million years old. They were the first fossils of hominins to be discovered outside of Europe and, after Neanderthals, the second evidence of fossil relatives of anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens). The finds from Java were first referred to as Anthropopithecus and later as Pithecanthropus erectus. Today they are assigned to the species Homo erectus by most paleoanthropologists, whereby their origin is occasionally - as suggested by Franz Weidenreich in 1940 - emphasized by the addition of a subspecies epithet: Homo erectus javanensis. More than 50 years after Dubois's find, Ralph von Koenigswald recollected that, 'No other paleontological discovery has created such a sensation and led to such a variety of conflicting scientific opinions.'"

The inhabitants of the village do not approach these; they tend towards great aggression, even the big game does not dare to approach them. Their roar could be heard from a great distance. 'You can hear them near the village, especially at night when the animals are particularly active and migrate to their pastures', says the local.

Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first described it as grisley, which could be interpreted as either "grizzly" (i.e., "grizzled"—that is, with grey-tipped hair) or "grisly" ("fear-inspiring", now usually "gruesome"). Grizzly bears are some of the largest subspecies of Brown Bear, only being beaten by the Kamchatka brown bears and the Kodiak bears. Grizzly bears vary in size depending on timing and populations.

Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting. The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down upon and snatches from the water with its talons. Bald eagles are not actually bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, 'white headed'. The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States of America and appears on its seal."

 dubois.104.f: "The American bison (Bison bison), also called the American buffalo or simply buffalo, is a species of bison native to North America. It is one of two extant species of bison, alongside the European bison. Buffalo was applied to the American bison by Samuel de Champlain as the French word buffles in 1616, after seeing skins and a drawing. These were shown to him by members of the Nipissing First Nation. The word bison was applied in the 1690s. A bison has a shaggy, long, dark-brown winter coat, and a lighter-weight, lighter-brown summer coat. Male bison are significantly larger and heavier than females. Once roaming in vast herds, the species nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle."

It lives in pinelands, tropical hardwood hammocks, and mixed freshwater swamp forests. Florida panthers are spotted at birth, and typically have blue eyes. As the panther grows, the spots fade and the coat becomes completely tan, while the eyes typically take on a yellow hue. The panther's underbelly is a creamy white, and it has black tips on the tail and ears. Florida panthers lack the ability to roar, and instead make distinct sounds that include whistles, chirps, growls, hisses, and purrs."

 dubois.111.f: "The brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) is a species of three-toed sloth found in the Neotropical realm of Central and South America. Brown-throated sloths sleep 15 to 18 hours every day and are active for only brief periods of time, which may be during either the day or night. Although they can walk along the ground, and even swim, they spend most of their lives in the high branches of trees, descending once every eight days or so to defecate in the soil. They do not travel far, with home ranges of only around 0.5 to 9 ha (1.2 to 22.2 acres), depending on the local environment. Within a typical, 5-hectare (12-acre) range, a brown-throated sloth will visit around 40 trees, and may specialise on one particular species, even spending up to 20% of its time in a single specific tree."

 dubois.112.d: "Our zoo is enriched by a new, wonderful animal: today the long-awaited #O Jaguar#! moved into its new enclosure."
 dubois.112.f: "The jaguar (Panthera onca) is the only living member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas. With a body length of up to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) and a weight of up to 158 kg (348 lb), it is the largest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the world. Its distinctively marked coat features pale yellow to tan colored fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides, although a melanistic black coat appears in some individuals. The jaguar's powerful bite allows it to pierce the carapaces of turtles and tortoises, and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of mammalian prey between the ears to deliver a fatal blow to the brain. The word 'jaguar' is possibly derived from the Tupi-Guarani word yaguara meaning 'wild beast that overcomes its prey at a bound'."

 dubois.113.f: "The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is an insectivorous mammal native to Central and South America. It is one of four living species of anteaters, of which it is the largest member. It feeds primarily on ants and termites, using its fore claws to dig them up and its long, sticky tongue to collect them. Though giant anteaters live in overlapping home ranges, they are mostly solitary except during mother-offspring relationships, aggressive interactions between males, and when mating. The giant anteater is the most terrestrial of the living anteater species. Its ancestors may originally have been adapted to arboreal life."

 dubois.114.f: "The nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) is a mammal found in North, Central, and South America, making it the most widespread of the armadillos. Its ancestors originated in South America, and remained there until the formation of the Isthmus of Panama allowed them to enter North America as part of the Great American Interchange. The nine-banded armadillo is a solitary, mainly nocturnal animal, found in many kinds of habitats, from mature and secondary rainforests to grassland and dry scrub. The outer shell is composed of ossified dermal scutes covered by nonoverlapping, keratinized epidermal scales, which are connected by flexible bands of skin. This armor covers the back, sides, head, tail, and outside surfaces of the legs."

Found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan. It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. The Andean condor is a national symbol of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions."

 dubois.121.f: "The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a wild cat species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe. The Iberian lynx has a short bright yellowish to tawny coloured spotted fur. The spots vary in shape and size from small round to elongate. They are arranged in lines and decrease in size from the back towards the sides. At the ends of the small, triangular ears there are brush hairs that are three centimeters long. As with the Eurasian lynx, they are important for the hearing ability of these lynxes. In the case of the Iberian lynx, experiments have shown that the loss of the brush reduces the ability to hear and locate. Iberian lynx are much smaller than the Eurasian lynx, which is more widespread in the north. With a body weight of between 9 and 15 kilograms, they weigh less than two thirds of a Eurasian lynx."

The fur of Eurasian wolves is colored yellowish-grey, grey-brown or dark grey. The underside of the muzzle and the throat are lighter, the backs of the ears appear slightly reddish. In most cases, the back coloring shows a dark to black saddle patch. The tip of the tail and the front of the forelegs are also often darker in colour. The howl of the Eurasian wolf is much more protracted and melodious than that of North American gray wolf subspecies, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable."

The European badger is a powerfully built, black, white, brown, and grey animal with a small head, a stocky body, small black eyes, and a short tail. Its weight varies, being 7-13 kg (15-29 lb) in spring, but building up to 15-17 kg (33-37 lb) in autumn before the winter sleep period. It is nocturnal and is a social, burrowing animal that sleeps during the day in one of several setts in its territorial range. The dens they construct (called setts) are the most complex, and are passed on from generation to generation."

The name ermine is used for species in the genus Mustela, especially the stoat, in its pure white winter coat, or the fur thereof. The stoat is similar to the least weasel in general proportions, manner of posture, and movement, though the tail is relatively longer, always exceeding a third of the body length, though it is shorter than that of the long-tailed weasel. As with the least weasel, mouse-like rodents predominate in the stoat's diet. However, unlike the least weasel, which almost exclusively feeds on small voles, the stoat regularly preys on larger rodent and lagomorph species, and will take down individuals far larger than itself."

 dubois.125.f: "The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) is a semiaquatic mammal native to Eurasia. The Eurasian otter has a diet mainly of fish, and is strongly territorial. As with various other mustelid species, otters are capable of overpowering and killing prey significantly larger than themselves, and are known to hunt large waterbirds such as adult greylag geese on occasion. Due to the unusual structure of its hair, the fur of the otter offers particularly effective insulation against cold and wet: like a zipper, the hair is interlocked with microscopically small, interlocking wedges and grooves. An extraordinarily dense fur braid is created, which traps insulating air bubbles, but at the same time repels water. This keeps the otter's skin dry and its body warm."

After elephants and rhinos, the hippopotamus is the next largest land mammal. It is also the largest extant land artiodactyl. Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps. Territorial bulls each preside over a stretch of water and a group of five to thirty cows and calves. During the day, hippos remain cool by staying in water or mud, emerging at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos typically do not display territorial behaviour on land. Hippos are among the most dangerous animals in the world due to their aggressive and unpredictable nature."

It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature."

It is the largest living terrestrial animal, with bulls reaching a shoulder height of up to 3.96 m (13 ft 0 in) and a body mass of up to 10.4 t (11.5 short tons). It is a social mammal, travelling in herds composed of cows and their offspring. The African bush elephant has grey skin with scanty hairs. Its large ears cover the whole shoulder and help to reduce body heat; flapping them creates air currents and exposes large blood vessels on the inner sides to increase heat loss during hot weather. Africa bush elephants use their trunks for tactile communication. When greeting, a lower ranking individual will insert the tip of its trunk into its superior's mouth. Elephants will also stretch out their trunk toward an approaching individual they intend to greet."

The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes are usually found in groups that vary in size and composition according to ecological, anthropogenic, temporal, and social factors. With its lanky build and spotted coat, the giraffe has been a source of fascination throughout human history, and its image is widespread in culture."

Like all extant penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. The species has distinctive pink patches of skin above the eyes and a black facial mask. The body's upper parts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts, which are spotted and marked with a black band. The African penguin is a pursuit diver and feeds primarily on fish and squid and is the only penguin species that breeds in Africa. African penguins are a commonly seen species in zoos across the world. Because they do not require particularly low temperatures, they are often kept in outside enclosures."

The name 'giant panda' is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas are generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. The low nutrition quality of bamboo means pandas need to eat more frequently, and due to their lack of major predators they can be active at any time of the day."

They have proportionally long arms and short legs, and have reddish-brown hair covering their bodies. Dominant adult males develop distinctive cheek pads or flanges and make long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals; younger subordinate males do not and more resemble adult females. They are the most solitary of the great apes: social bonds occur primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring. Orangutans are among the most intelligent primates. They use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage."

The Bengal tiger's coat is yellow to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black; the belly and the interior parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings. The basic social unit of the tiger is composed of a female and her offspring. Adult animals congregate only temporarily when special conditions permit, such as plentiful supplies of food. Otherwise, they lead solitary lives, hunting individually for the forest and grassland animals upon which they prey. In most cases, tigers approach their victim from the side or behind from as close a distance as possible and grasp the prey's throat to kill it."

It is easily identified by its markings, most notably the light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its hindquarters. It is covered in black hair, except for the tips of its ears, which, as with other tapirs, are rimmed with white. The pattern is for camouflage; the disrupted coloration breaks up its outline and makes it more difficult to recognize; other animals may mistake it for a large rock, rather than prey, when it is lying down to sleep. Malayan tapirs have very poor eyesight, instead relying on excellent senses of smell and hearing."

It is the largest extant species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 m (9.8 ft), and weighing up to 70 kg (150 lb). As a result of their size, Komodo dragons are apex predators, and dominate the ecosystems in which they live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. Komodo dragons' group behavior in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. Their diet mainly consists of Javan rusa (Rusa timorensis), though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion. They were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910. Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits."

The dorsoventrally flattened body of C. mydas is covered by a large, teardrop-shaped carapace; it has a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific populations, parts of the carapace can be almost black. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses. Like other sea turtles, green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. Green sea turtles may live to 90 years in the wild."

It is circumglobal and is typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, but can also be found in temperate waters. The giant oceanic manta ray can grow up to 9 m (30 ft) in maximum length and to a disc size of 7 m (23 ft) across with a weight of about 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) but average size commonly observed is 4.5 m (15 ft). The skin is smooth with a scattering of conical and ridge-shaped tubercles. The colouring of the dorsal (upper) surface is black, dark brown, or steely blue, sometimes with a few pale spots and usually with a pale edge. Because of its large size and velocity in case of danger, the oceanic manta ray has very few natural predators that could be fatal to it."

This species is a very large kangaroo with long, pointed ears and a square shaped muzzle. They are sexually dimorphic as the males have short, red-brown fur, fading to pale buff below and on the limbs. Males grow up to a head-and-body length of 1.3-1.6 m (4 ft 3 in to 5 ft 3 in) with a tail that adds a further 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) to the total length and are referred to by Australians as 'Big Reds'. The red kangaroo's legs work much like a rubber band, with the Achilles tendon stretching as the animal comes down, then releasing its energy to propel the animal up and forward, enabling the characteristic bouncing locomotion. They can reach speeds of around 60 km/h (37 mph)."

It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxins that deter most other mammals from feeding on it. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala along with the kangaroos are recognised worldwide as symbols of Australia."

Like other monotremes, it senses prey through electrolocation. It is one of the few species of venomous mammals, as the male platypus has a spur on the hind foot that delivers a venom, capable of causing severe pain to humans. The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it. In 1799, the first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body judged it a fake, made of several animals sewn together. The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology, and a recognisable and iconic symbol of Australia."

Since sharks produce a large number of teeth because of their revolver teeth, these are among the most frequently found fossils. As early as 1616, Fabio Colonna was able to show in his treatise De Glossopetris Dissertatio that the supposed viper tongues are in fact shark teeth. Squalicorax pristodontus had flat, triangular teeth, up to a maximum of three centimeters long. The cutting edges were finely serrated like today in the tiger shark. In the Cretaceous period, the genus Squalicorax was distributed worldwide. Fossilized teeth have been found in Mesozoic sediments in the Americas, Africa, Japan, Australia, India, Russia, the Middle East and Europe."

 dubois.204.f: "Palaeosinopa is a genus of mammals in the Pantolestidae family, now extinct. The animals resembled today's insectivores and lived from the Upper Paleocene to the Lower Eocene 59 to 48 million years ago. Evidence is mainly known from North America, more rarely from Europe. Important finds, including some complete skeletons, come from the north-west of the USA. The fossil butte member of the Green River Formation with an age of about 52 million years and the stratigraphically somewhat older Willwood Formation are particularly outstanding. Representatives of Palaeosinopa were characterized by a robust physique and a long tail. The shorter front legs compared to the longer hind legs appeared rather primitive. Due to the physique, a semi-aquatic way of life is reconstructed for the animals, the structure of the teeth in turn speaks for predominantly animal food. As a result, Palaeosinopa seems to have inhabited a habitat similar to that of today's otters."

Mine management was concerned that a paleontological dig could interfere with the work. And indeed, after a brief inspection of the finds, Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_paleontologist_scope').GetLastName] should determine that the work in the shaft would have to be postponed in favor of a professional scientific excavation. The industrialists have already protested. The fossil find thus becomes a political issue. Because the intelligentsia is now also highly interested and insists on excavating the fossils.

They existed for almost the entire span of the Paleozoic, from the 2nd series of the Cambrian (starting 521 million years ago) to the mass extinction event at the end of the Permian, about 251 million years ago. Large numbers of their exoskeletons, reinforced with calcite (calcium carbonate), have been preserved as fossils, making it possible to reconstruct the evolution and variety of forms of the numerous species. This, combined with their stratigraphic persistence and wide geographical range, makes trilobites important index fossils for the Paleozoic, particularly the Cambrian. The extinct class of Trilobita consists of nine recognized orders, over 150 families, over 5000 genera, and more than 15,000 described species."

The number of species may have been around 30,000 to 40,000. The size of the shell of adult animals is usually in the range of 1 to 30 cm. From their first appearance in the Lower Devonian to their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous (Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary), ammonites represent a large number of index fossils over a period of about 350 million years; in part, the chronological delimitation of marine sediments is carried out exclusively on the basis of ammonites. They are therefore of great importance for geology and paleontology. The taxon Ammonoidea was first mentioned in 1884 by Karl Alfred von Zittel in his Handbook on Paleontology. The name comes from antiquity, Pliny the Elder referred to fossils as 'Ammonis cornua' (Ammon's horns)."

 dubois.209.d: "Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_paleontologist_scope').GetLastName] has discovered a rare, prehistoric fish form that could represent a first step in the transition from aquatic to terrestrial animals."
 dubois.209.f: "Eusthenopteron is an extinct genus of fishy finfish (Sarcopterygii) from the Upper Devonian of North America and Europe. It is considered a prime example of original representatives of the Tetrapodomorpha. Since Eusthenopteron possessed a lung-swimming-bladder-organ and a powerful fin skeleton in addition to the gills, it could have been possible for it to move briefly outside of water. In the skeleton of the front fins, the three extremity bones of land vertebrates, humerus, ulna and radius, can already be differentiated. The two pointed dorsal fins were set far back, the pelvic fins and anal fin facing them."

 dubois.210.d: "Some round objects, first thought to be mere stones, have turned out to be eggs on closer examination. Scientists aren't yet sure who they belonged to exactly, but they undoubtedly assign them to a species of dinosaur."
 dubois.210.f: "In 1859, the first scientifically documented dinosaur egg fossils were discovered in southern France by a Catholic priest and amateur naturalist named Father Jean-Jacques Pouech; he thought, however, that they were laid by giant birds. The first scientifically recognized dinosaur egg fossils were discovered serendipitously in 1923 by an American Museum of Natural History crew while looking for evidence of early humans in Mongolia. These eggs were mistakenly attributed to the locally abundant herbivore Protoceratops, but are now known to be Oviraptor eggs. Egg discoveries continued to mount all over the world, leading to the development of multiple competing classification schemes. "

 dubois.1000.t: "Le Carnaval des animaux"
 dubois.1000.d: "During his recent visit to the zoo, our composer was inspired in particular by the lion, the elephant, the kangaroo and the turtles for a humorous little work, which he christened 'Carnival of the Animals'."
 dubois.1000.f: "The 'Carnival of the Animals', subtitled Grande fantaisie zoologique, was composed by Camille Saint-Saëns in January 1886 in a small Austrian village. Here, in just a few days, he processed early sketches for the Carnaval, which date from a time when he was working as a teacher at a private music school in Paris, commissioned by Aristide Dietsch (1861/1865). When musical parodies were on the curriculum there, Saint-Saëns was persuaded by his students to realize one of his many ideas for a humorous piece of music. However, concerned about his reputation, Saint-Saëns decided not to publish the work for chamber orchestra. Because apart from the fact that the composer imitated animal calls through the instruments in the pieces, he had parodied several of his professional colleagues. Although the composers were dead by then, Saint-Saëns did not want to upset their admirers. The work was only published posthumously by its publisher Jacques Durand."

 dubois.1012.f1: "The Hippopotami were floating in the water in their enclosure. Not a lot was happening. You wondered if they ever did anything when a zookeeper appeared next to you.\n\n\"It is so fascinating how the Hippos usually just float around during the day. But after dusk they become very active and start to forage. But it's obvious if you know how hot it is in their natural habitat. The water cools them during the day and in the evening and night they can finally start roaming around.\""
 dubois.1012.f2: "Suddenly a Hippo emerged from the water. You haven't seen that one before, even though you were watching the enclosure for multiple minutes. It must have been in the water for quite some time.\n\nA person next to you started speaking: \"Isn't it fascinating? Those Hippos can stay under water for five minutes. When they submerge, their nostrils and ears are shut, so no water can enter.\""
 dubois.1012.f3: "One of the Hippopotami opened its huge mouth and showed its long, curved teeth. Then it started grunting and splashing.\n\nYou once read that male Hippos do this to warn off rivals, as they are very protective of their territory. Male Hippos use their feces to mark specific points in their territory as well. Someties they even stare at other male hippos as a form of dominance."

 dubois.1013.t: "Lion Enclosure"
 dubois.1013.d: "A pack of #o Lions#! can be found in the lion enclosure. The enclosure features a tree for shade and a small pond for drinking."
 dubois.1013.f1: "The magnificent lions was laying in the middle of its pride. The mane of the male lion was big and quite dark. Suddenly the lion yawned and showed its teeth.\n\nApparently the mane of the male lions grows longer and longer reaching up to 16 cm. The older the lion gets, the darker its mane becomes. The mane probably has two main purposes: To attract females and to pretect the lion's throat and neck during fights. The thickness of the mane depends on the temperatures in the lion's habitat. In colder regions the manes are far heavier for lions living in zoos in Europe and North America."
 dubois.1013.f2: "At first it was only one Lion roaring but then the others joined in. With each Lion the roaring got louder and louder. Then, suddenly, they stopped all at once.\n\nLions usually live in prides of related animals. The majority of the females stay in the same pride their entire life, while the males usually join other prides or coalitions of other male lions. In the pride the females are usually the hunters having a way higher chance of catching prey. The males have about a 10% chance of actually catching their prey. But when they catch a big animal, lions can eat up to 40 kg of meat."
 dubois.1013.f3: "In the confines of a zoo, the mighty lion paces back and forth within its enclosure. Its muscular body exudes power and grace as it surveys its surroundings. The lion's restless movements catch your attention, prompting you to ponder the secrets behind its behavior. As you ponder, a knowledgeable zookeeper approaches, ready to share insights about these magnificent creatures.\n\n\"It's fascinating to observe the lions in their enclosure,\" the zookeeper begins. \"During the day, they often engage in repetitive pacing, a behavior that can be seen both in captive lions and their wild counterparts. This pacing is believed to be a result of their natural instinct to patrol and mark their territory, even in the absence of vast grasslands or expansive landscapes.\""
 dubois.1013.f4: "At the zoo, [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_prinz_eugen').GetFullName] is known for checking on the old lion in the enclosure every day. The veteran feels a deep connection to the animal. Both seem like witnesses to times past of glory and honor. Zoo visitors say there is a bond between this specific animal and the man.\n\nBut finally three days came when the lion no longer saw his master, he refused to eat anything and paced restlessly up and down in the enclosure. At around three in the morning he let out such a roar that the animal keeper ran out into the enclosure to see. At the same time he heard the death knell ring in the chapel and so he knew that his master, the great General [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_prinz_eugen').GetLastName], had died at that very hour. It's the stuff that touches even the hardest hearts of soldiers."

 dubois.1014.t: "Elephant Enclosure"
 dubois.1014.d: "In a vast enclosure the Elephants are roaming around. They are one of the biggest attractions of the Zoo and there are always people watching them."
 dubois.1014.f1: "You were observing the Elephants for quite some time. One of them stroke out to you. It was a huge female Elephant with long tusks. She seemed to take the lead sometimes and the other Elephants seemed to respect her a lot.\n\n\"I see you found the Matriarch of the Elephants!\", you didn't even notice that a zookeeper was standing next to you, \""These majestic creatures live in tight-knit family units known as herds. Within the herd, you'll often find a matriarch, a wise and experienced female who leads and protects the group. In their family, the Elephants have strong social bonds. They even mourn the loss of one of their group. Luckily we didn't have an Elephant death in years!\""
 dubois.1014.f2: "One of the Elephants was trumpeting. It sounded great! You would probably even have heard it from hundreds of meters away.\n\nIt reminded you of a text you once read about elephants: "African elephants possess an incredible ability to communicate over long distances. Through a variety of vocalizations, such as trumpets, rumbles, and roars, they convey information to other members of their herd, whether it's a warning of danger or a call to regroup.\""
 dubois.1014.f3: "One of the Elephants came closer to you. Its trunk slowly approached you. Wasn't that the Elephant you fed some food a year ago? No, that couldn't be. It would have forgotten you by now! Nonetheless you gave the elephant a fruit you brought for yourself.\n\n\"I think she remembers you.\", a zookeeper was standing next to you, \"Elephants can remember things over years, even decades. It's fascinating, sometimes they remember a visitor and act accordingly. Once an Elephant took some woman's purse because she threw a stone at the Elephant as a child. They have an astonishing recall of locations, water sources, and even individuals they have encountered. This remarkable memory helps them navigate their environment and maintain strong social connections.\""

 dubois.1015.t: "Giraffe Enclosure"
 dubois.1015.d: "The Giraffes were visible from far away. Their heads reached high above the ground to get some fresh leaves from the trees."
 dubois.1015.f1: "The giraffe's blue tongue curled around the green branches in your hand. In the process, the tongue slid over your hand. It was rough and very long.\n\nYou remember something that you once read in a book: The giraffe's tongue was perfectly adapted to its environment. It was designed to graze the acacia leaves from the branch without getting hurt by the thorns. To eat the 30 kilograms of leaves per day, the giraffe has to tear leaves from the trees for up to 12 hours. At the same time, the leaves also cover a large part of the giraffe's water needs."
 dubois.1015.f2: "Two of the Giraffes stood side by side when they suddenly started to hit each others sides with their heads. Their long neck allowed them to fling their head and aim for their opponent. What could cause such savage behaviour?\n\n\"Don't be afraid! This is a natural behaviour.\", a zookeeper stood next to you and started to explain, \"Giraffes are social animals that form loose-knit herds. These herds are often composed of females and their young, with occasional bachelor groups of young males. Within the herd, giraffes engage in various forms of social interaction, including necking, a behavior where males engage in gentle sparring to establish dominance or gain mating rights. That's exactly what you just saw!\""
 dubois.1015.f3: "You listened to a zookeeper talking about the Giraffes with a group of people: \"Giraffes have a distinct coat pattern that resembles a mosaic of irregular patches. These patterns, which vary among individuals, help Giraffes camouflage themselves within their surroundings, providing them with a measure of protection against predators. Apart from that the lighter stripes help the Giraffe to cool down. If they only had dark hair, they would overheat in the savannah.\""

 dubois.1016.t: "African Penguin Enclosure"
 dubois.1016.d: "Some Penguins were swiming in the water, others were standing together, one was waggling with its wings."
 dubois.1016.f1: "In the bustling penguin exhibit of the zoo, a lively colony of African Penguins waddles and frolics in the water. Their sleek black and white plumage glistens under the sunlight, drawing the attention of visitors. Mesmerized by their playful antics, you approach a nearby zookeeper, eager to learn more about these charismatic creatures.\n\n\"The African Penguin, also known as the Jackass Penguin due to its donkey-like braying call, is a remarkable species," the zookeeper begins. "These penguins are endemic to the coastlines of Southern Africa, specifically found in the waters surrounding Namibia and South Africa. Unlike their counterparts in Antarctica, African Penguins thrive in a warmer climate, making them well-suited to the coastal regions they call home.\""
 dubois.1016.f2: "You watch as a penguin struggles with a rock. Parts of the rock fly away, so it must be soft rock. You watch with interest as the penguin continues to dig.\n\nDidn't you read something about that? The African penguins dig a nesting cave in guano deposits. This guano comes from the droppings of hundreds of generations of birds. In South Africa there are large deposits of guano where the penguins nest. Thereby the partners take turns in breeding."
 dubois.1016.f3: "As you marvel at the penguins' playful splashes in the water, a zookeeper shares a fascinating detail: \"One unique characteristic of African Penguins is their exceptional swimming ability. They are agile and streamlined underwater, relying on their flippers to propel themselves through the ocean in search of small fish and squid, which make up the majority of their diet. Their waterproof feathers and dense layer of blubber provide insulation, allowing them to withstand the cold ocean temperatures.\""
