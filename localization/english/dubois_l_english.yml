 dubois_theory_of_evolution_tech: "Theory of Evolution"
 dubois_theory_of_evolution_tech_desc: "The crucial break from the concept of constant typological types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection. Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a 'struggle for existence' in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe."
 dubois_paleontology_tech: "Paleontology"
 dubois_paleontology_tech_desc: "An interest in the history of the earth and extinct animals can be traced back to antiquity and reached a first peak with the studies of Georges Cuvier around 1800. But the publication of the 'On the Origin of Species' was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of 'Origin' led to a concerted effort to look for transitional fossils and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record."
 dubois_genetics_tech: "Genetics"
 dubois_genetics_tech_desc: "Modern genetics began with the work of the Augustinian friar Gregor Johann Mendel. The 1900 rediscovery of Mendel's work led to rapid advances in genetics. By 1915 the basic principles of Mendelian genetics had been studied in a wide variety of organisms — most notably the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Alongside experimental work, mathematicians developed the statistical framework of population genetics, bringing genetic explanations into the study of evolution."

 dubois.3.f: "'When on board HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species - that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.' - Charles Darwin"

 dubois.4.t: "Kosmos"
 dubois.4.d: "Kosmos (usually referred to in English as 'Cosmos') was an influential treatise on science and nature written by the German scientist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt. Kosmos began as a lecture series delivered by Humboldt at the University of Berlin, and was published in five volumes between 1845 and 1862 (the fifth was posthumous and incomplete)."
 dubois.4.f: "'Late in the evening of a busy life, I am handing over to the German public a work whose vague image has hovered before my soul for almost half a century. In many moods I considered this work unworkable: and when I had given it up, I returned to it again, perhaps carelessly. I dedicate it to my contemporaries with the timidity that a just mistrust of the measure of my powers must inspire in me.

 dubois.5.f: "'Experience of artificial fertilisation, such as is effected with ornamental plants in order to obtain new variations in colour, has led to the experiments which will here be discussed. The striking-regularity with which the same hybrid forms always reappeared whenever fertilisation took place between the same species induced further experiments to be undertaken, the object of which was to follow up the developments of the hybrids in their progeny.' -Gregor Mendel"

 dubois.6.d: "The Dutch doctor and anatomist [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_new_paleontologist_scope').GetFullName] caused a scientific sensation in his targeted search for the ancestors of man. He discovered the skeleton of a prehistoric man who lived a million years ago."
 dubois.6.f: "The fossils first discovered by [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_new_paleontologist_scope').GetFullName] in 1891 on the banks of the Solo River near Trinil in East Java are called Java Man. According to current knowledge, they are said to be around one million years old. They were the first fossils of hominins to be discovered outside of Europe and, after Neanderthals, the second evidence of fossil relatives of anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens). The finds from Java were first referred to as Anthropopithecus and later as Pithecanthropus erectus. Today they are assigned to the species Homo erectus by most paleoanthropologists, whereby their origin is occasionally - as suggested by Franz Weidenreich in 1940 - emphasized by the addition of a subspecies epithet: Homo erectus javanensis. More than 50 years after Dubois's find, Ralph von Koenigswald recollected that, 'No other paleontological discovery has created such a sensation and led to such a variety of conflicting scientific opinions.'"

 dubois.32.f.hippopotamus.1: "A local says he saw a herd of hippos bathing in the nearest river days ago. The inhabitants of the village do not approach these; they tend towards great aggression, even the big game does not dare to approach them. Their roar could be heard from a great distance. 'You can hear them near the village, especially at night when the animals are particularly active and migrate to their pastures', says the local. A mother hippo is said to have recently killed a crocodile to defend a cub; Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] was able to see this for himself when he examined the carcass of the unfortunate reptile."
 dubois.32.f.hippopotamus.2: "As the morning mist lifts, the silhouette of a colossal creature emerges from the murky depths of the river. Tales of the elusive river giants have spread among the locals, speaking of their unmatched strength and fearsome nature. The hippos, with their massive jaws and ivory tusks, command respect and instill terror in the hearts of all who cross their path. Only a daring [concept_dubois_naturalist] like Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] could hope to capture such a formidable beast, for it is said that even the king of the jungle treads lightly in their domain."
 dubois.32.f.hippopotamus.3: "Rumors of a legendary hippopotamus have captivated the imaginations of explorers, and their accounts echo through the dense undergrowth of the African savannah. This behemoth, known as "The Ivory Behemoth," possesses ivory-like armor plates that glisten in the sunlight, rendering it nearly invulnerable to the teeth and claws of other predators. The local tribes revere the creature, attributing mythical powers to its presence. To behold this majestic beast, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] must navigate treacherous swamps and overcome the perils of the wild, armed only with his knowledge and the hope of capturing a living legend for the world to marvel at in wonder."
 dubois.32.f.lion.1: "Across the vast expanse of the untamed African plains, a majestic predator reigns supreme. The lion, with its golden mane and piercing gaze, stands as the embodiment of power and regal authority. Its mighty roar resonates through the air, sending shivers down the spines of both prey and predator alike. The locals speak of a lioness, known as "The Queen of the Savannah," who has single-handedly defended her pride against rival clans and even fended off the ferocious hyenas. To capture the essence of such magnificence, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] must venture into the heart of the savannah, where danger lurks in every shadow, and witness the raw prowess of nature's royal monarch."
 dubois.32.f.lion.2: "Deep within the African wilderness, a feline monarch commands its domain with unwavering authority. The lion, known as "The Golden Sovereign," possesses a mane that shimmers like the sun's rays, making it an unmistakable symbol of power and dominance. Tales of its incredible strength and stealth have traveled far and wide, captivating the minds of adventurers and naturalists alike. The locals whisper of a rare sighting, a clash of titans between The Golden Sovereign and a formidable Cape buffalo. To witness this epic encounter, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] must tread carefully through the savannah, navigating a realm where only the fearless dare to venture."
 dubois.32.f.lion.3: "In the heart of the African wilderness, where the sweltering heat is tempered by the awe-inspiring beauty of the savannah, roams a creature feared and revered by all. The lion, with its muscular build and predatory grace, embodies the essence of untamed majesty. Its thunderous roar echoes across the plains, a resonating call to all creatures that the king of beasts is near. Legends tell of a lion pride led by an indomitable patriarch, whose sheer presence commands respect from even the most formidable predators. To observe this majestic ruler in his natural habitat, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] must overcome the challenges of the wild, immersing himself in a world where the balance between life and death hangs by a delicate thread."
 dubois.32.f.elephant.1: "A herd of elephants stomps dust into the air. A caravan, led by a matriarch, moves through the countryside. Hudnerte, sometimes thousands of kilometers such groups cover sometimes. Young animals remain in the care of their mothers. Then the group stops in a small grove, stretching their trunks up into trees. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] observes the events through binoculars and studies social behavior. Basically, he has grown sick of the idea of snatching one of the animals from the herd, but the zoo's patrons remind him that his trip and food was not provided free of charge by the state - there is a job to be done."
 dubois.32.f.elephant.2: "The gentle giants of the savannah, elephants, roam the vast landscapes in search of nourishment and water. Their immense size commands respect, yet their tender interactions within the herd reveal a deep sense of familial bonds. Led by a wise matriarch, the elephants traverse great distances, their synchronized footsteps echoing through the grasslands. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName], with a heavy heart, sets his gaze upon them, torn between admiration for their grace and the task that lies ahead. To capture an elephant for the zoo, he must reconcile his duty with the understanding that disrupting the intricate tapestry of their social fabric comes at a profound cost."
 dubois.32.f.elephant.3: "In the shadow of towering baobab trees, a congregation of elephants, adorned with magnificent tusks, gathers at a tranquil watering hole. The matriarch's keen eyes scan the surroundings, ensuring the safety of her precious kin. The harmonious symphony of their trumpets fills the air, a testament to their collective wisdom and shared experiences. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName], conflicted by the allure of capturing one of these sentient beings and the nagging weight of responsibility, wrestles with the moral implications of his quest. As he observes their complex social dynamics, he grapples with the profound question of whether the pursuit of knowledge justifies the disruption of a harmonious existence."
 dubois.32.f.giraffe.1: "For days, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName]'s safari group had been looking for the mere sign of a giraffe, but had not found anything until the very end. But one morning the necks of the elegant animals stretch in the air against the rising morning sun and form shadows against the reddish fireball. The Safari team sets out immediately so as not to miss this opportunity."
 dubois.32.f.giraffe.2: "Through the golden hues of the African dawn, a wondrous sight unfolds. Tall and graceful, the giraffes emerge from the dense foliage, their elongated necks reaching towards the heavens. Like ethereal beings, they cast elongated shadows against the fiery sky, their spots blending seamlessly with the dappled light. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName], his heart filled with awe, scrambles to assemble his equipment, determined not to let this fleeting moment slip away. With each careful step, he ventures closer to the giraffes, eager to unravel the mysteries hidden within their extraordinary anatomy and observe the poetry of their movements."
 dubois.32.f.giraffe.3: "In the vast African plains, a vision of elegance unfolds as the giraffes gracefully navigate the verdant landscape. Their slender legs carry them with a balletic grace, while their long necks extend high above the trees, as if reaching for the heavens themselves. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] and his safari team, their hearts pounding with anticipation, witness this mesmerizing spectacle. With a keen eye for detail, the professor studies the intricate patterns of their spots and marvels at their ability to thrive in their unique habitat. To capture the essence of these magnificent creatures, he must navigate the delicate balance between observation and intrusion, preserving the magic that makes giraffes the epitome of grace in the wild."
 dubois.32.f.zebra.1: "A few weeks after arriving in Africa, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName]'s safari caught up with locals about the next herd of zebras roaming the region. It doesn't take long before they find the animals with the characteristic stripes in the evening sun between savannah dust, bushes and gnarled trees. The graceful animals don't even seem to notice them. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] first wants to take the time to study the behavior and lifestyle of the zebra herd, but like many other researchers he is interested in finding out the evolutionary background of the famous zebra pattern. Unfortunately, he is interrupted by a member of the safari team, who points out that if they wait too long, the herd may move on again."
 dubois.32.f.zebra.2: "Maybe following zebras wasn't the best decision. These animals could move up to 500 kilometers from place to place and thus change the center  of the herd to large geographical latitudes. However, there was one quirk that made them predictable: they usually stayed no more than 12 kilometers from a water source. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName]'s safari takes this detail as an opportunity to wait at the next possible watering hole. With success! Soon the herd shows up again, giving the opportunity to finally catch one of the animals for the zoo."
 dubois.32.f.zebra.3: "After several weeks of searching for zebras, Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] spots the carcass of a mangled animal in the distance. It was apparently the victim of a lion attack. Since the lions have only recently moved away, the safari team is motivated to continue the search more intensively. Soon loud snorts and mixed calls from donkey and horse-like noises sound. Zebra tails whip in the air over savannah grass. The safari participants watch a grazing herd from a hill."

 dubois.102.f: "The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), also known as the North American brown bear or simply grizzly, is a population or subspecies of the brown bear inhabiting North America. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first described it as grisley, which could be interpreted as either "grizzly" (i.e., "grizzled"—that is, with grey-tipped hair) or "grisly" ("fear-inspiring", now usually "gruesome"). Grizzly bears are some of the largest subspecies of Brown Bear, only being beaten by the Kamchatka brown bears and the Kodiak bears. Grizzly bears vary in size depending on timing and populations. The original range of grizzly bears includes large parts of western and central North America. It descends from a Eurasian population of brown bears that migrated across the temporarily dry Bering Strait."

Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting. The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down upon and snatches from the water with its talons. Bald eagles are not actually bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, 'white headed'. The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States of America and appears on its seal."

 dubois.104.f: "The American bison (Bison bison), also called the American buffalo or simply buffalo, is a species of bison native to North America. It is one of two extant species of bison, alongside the European bison. Buffalo was applied to the American bison by Samuel de Champlain as the French word buffles in 1616, after seeing skins and a drawing. These were shown to him by members of the Nipissing First Nation. The word bison was applied in the 1690s. A bison has a shaggy, long, dark-brown winter coat, and a lighter-weight, lighter-brown summer coat. Male bison are significantly larger and heavier than females. Once roaming in vast herds, the species nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle."

It lives in pinelands, tropical hardwood hammocks, and mixed freshwater swamp forests. Florida panthers are spotted at birth, and typically have blue eyes. As the panther grows, the spots fade and the coat becomes completely tan, while the eyes typically take on a yellow hue. The panther's underbelly is a creamy white, and it has black tips on the tail and ears. Florida panthers lack the ability to roar, and instead make distinct sounds that include whistles, chirps, growls, hisses, and purrs."

 dubois.106.f: "American alligators are apex predators and consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They play an important role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, American alligators bellow to declare territory, and locate suitable mates. During the 19th and 20th centuries, larger males reaching 5 to 6 m were reported. The largest reported individual size was a male killed in 1890 on Marsh Island, Louisiana, and reportedly measured at 5.84 m in length, but no voucher specimen was available, since the American alligator was left on a muddy bank after having been measured due to having been too massive to relocate."

 dubois.107.f: "The axolotl is an aquatic Mexican tailed amphibian from the family of transverse-toothed newts, which occurs naturally only as permanent larvae. Axolotls reach sexual maturity without changing their external larval form and without undergoing a metamorphosis that is otherwise common in amphibians. In August 1804, Alexander von Humboldt was the first to bring axolotls to Europe, which - preserved in alcohol - served as an exotic curiosity in the Paris Museum of Natural History. Axolotls have the ability to restore limbs, organs, and even parts of the brain and heart. The regenerates are usually not crippled, but complete and functional. The ability to regenerate makes the species a worthwhile research object."

 dubois.111.f: "The brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) is a species of three-toed sloth found in the Neotropical realm of Central and South America. Brown-throated sloths sleep 15 to 18 hours every day and are active for only brief periods of time, which may be during either the day or night. Although they can walk along the ground, and even swim, they spend most of their lives in the high branches of trees, descending once every eight days or so to defecate in the soil. They do not travel far, with home ranges of only around 0.5 to 9 ha (1.2 to 22.2 acres), depending on the local environment. Within a typical, 5-hectare (12-acre) range, a brown-throated sloth will visit around 40 trees, and may specialise on one particular species, even spending up to 20% of its time in a single specific tree."

With a body length of up to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) and a weight of up to 158 kg (348 lb), it is the largest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the world. Its distinctively marked coat features pale yellow to tan colored fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides, although a melanistic black coat appears in some individuals. The jaguar's powerful bite allows it to pierce the carapaces of turtles and tortoises, and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of mammalian prey between the ears to deliver a fatal blow to the brain. The word 'jaguar' is possibly derived from the Tupi-Guarani word yaguara meaning 'wild beast that overcomes its prey at a bound'."

It is one of four living species of anteaters, of which it is the largest member. It feeds primarily on ants and termites, using its fore claws to dig them up and its long, sticky tongue to collect them. Though giant anteaters live in overlapping home ranges, they are mostly solitary except during mother-offspring relationships, aggressive interactions between males, and when mating. The giant anteater is the most terrestrial of the living anteater species. Its ancestors may originally have been adapted to arboreal life."

Its ancestors originated in South America, and remained there until the formation of the Isthmus of Panama allowed them to enter North America as part of the Great American Interchange. The nine-banded armadillo is a solitary, mainly nocturnal animal, found in many kinds of habitats, from mature and secondary rainforests to grassland and dry scrub. The outer shell is composed of ossified dermal scutes covered by nonoverlapping, keratinized epidermal scales, which are connected by flexible bands of skin.

Found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan. It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. The Andean condor is a national symbol of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions."

 dubois.116.f: "The West Indian manatee is a large, aquatic mammal native to warm coastal areas of the Caribbean. Living alone or in herds, it feeds on underwater plants and uses its whiskers to navigate. Since manatees are mammals, they breathe air, have warm blood, and produce milk. The West Indian manatee has a prehensile snout, like their relative the elephant, for grabbing vegetation and bringing it into their mouths. Because manatees evolved in habitats without natural predators, they lack predator avoidance behavior. The large size and low metabolic rates of manatees lends to their capacity for long and deep dives, as well as their relative lack of speed."

These relatively small primates are native to Central and South America and live in large groups that can number 12 to 100 individuals. Groups are composed of numerous males and females as well as the common young animals. They have a social structure that is unusual for apes: the group is built around the females, who develop a fixed hierarchy. The males often only stay at the edge of the group. Group members communicate by whistling and cackling. Squirrel monkeys feed mainly on insects and fruit, the proportion of which can vary depending on the season. Hunting insects takes up most of the day (up to 50% of the day), eating the fruit only around 10%."

The Iberian lynx has a short bright yellowish to tawny coloured spotted fur. The spots vary in shape and size from small round to elongate. They are arranged in lines and decrease in size from the back towards the sides. At the ends of the small, triangular ears there are brush hairs that are three centimeters long. As with the Eurasian lynx, they are important for the hearing ability of these lynxes. In the case of the Iberian lynx, experiments have shown that the loss of the brush reduces the ability to hear and locate. Iberian lynx are much smaller than the Eurasian lynx, which is more widespread in the north. With a body weight of between 9 and 15 kilograms, they weigh less than two thirds of a Eurasian lynx."

The fur of Eurasian wolves is colored yellowish-grey, grey-brown or dark grey. The underside of the muzzle and the throat are lighter, the backs of the ears appear slightly reddish. In most cases, the back coloring shows a dark to black saddle patch. The tip of the tail and the front of the forelegs are also often darker in colour. The howl of the Eurasian wolf is much more protracted and melodious than that of North American gray wolf subspecies, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable."

The name ermine is used for species in the genus Mustela, especially the stoat, in its pure white winter coat, or the fur thereof. The stoat is similar to the least weasel in general proportions, manner of posture, and movement, though the tail is relatively longer, always exceeding a third of the body length, though it is shorter than that of the long-tailed weasel. As with the least weasel, mouse-like rodents predominate in the stoat's diet. However, unlike the least weasel, which almost exclusively feeds on small voles, the stoat regularly preys on larger rodent and lagomorph species, and will take down individuals far larger than itself."

 dubois.125.f: "The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) is a semiaquatic mammal native to Eurasia. The Eurasian otter has a diet mainly of fish, and is strongly territorial. As with various other mustelid species, otters are capable of overpowering and killing prey significantly larger than themselves, and are known to hunt large waterbirds such as adult greylag geese on occasion. Due to the unusual structure of its hair, the fur of the otter offers particularly effective insulation against cold and wet: like a zipper, the hair is interlocked with microscopically small, interlocking wedges and grooves. An extraordinarily dense fur braid is created, which traps insulating air bubbles, but at the same time repels water. This keeps the otter's skin dry and its body warm."

It is a sexually dimorphic species: males are larger and carry longer, curved horns than females. Its coat colour is typically brownish grey. Alpine ibex tend to live in steep, rough terrain near the snow line. They are also social, although adult males and females segregate for most of the year, coming together only to mate. Alpine ibex are strictly herbivorous, with over half of their diet consisting of grasses, and the remainder being a mixture of mosses, flowers, leaves, and twigs. The Alpine ibex historically ranged through France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Bavaria, Austria and Slovenia. Starting in the early 16th century and with firearms becoming common, the overall population declined due to overexploitation and poaching."

Their habitat is temperate deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests. Wisents are herd animals, but according to their habitat they are only found in small groups. Since the extinction of the aurochs, the bison has been Europe's heaviest and largest land mammal and also the last representative of the wild bovine species on the European continent. In prehistory and early history, its distribution area stretched from the north of the Iberian Peninsula across Central Europe and the south of the Scandinavian Peninsula to the Baltic States; from the Bay of Riga the distribution limit ran south-east to the Black Sea and the Caucasus. In the 1920s the wisent was threatened with extinction; the last free-living wisent (a mountain wisent) was shot in 1927 in the Caucasus.

After elephants and rhinos, the hippopotamus is the next largest land mammal. It is also the largest extant land artiodactyl. Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps. Territorial bulls each preside over a stretch of water and a group of five to thirty cows and calves. During the day, hippos remain cool by staying in water or mud, emerging at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos typically do not display territorial behaviour on land. Hippos are among the most dangerous animals in the world due to their aggressive and unpredictable nature."

It is a social mammal, travelling in herds composed of cows and their offspring. The African bush elephant has grey skin with scanty hairs. Its large ears cover the whole shoulder and help to reduce body heat; flapping them creates air currents and exposes large blood vessels on the inner sides to increase heat loss during hot weather. Africa bush elephants use their trunks for tactile communication. When greeting, a lower ranking individual will insert the tip of its trunk into its superior's mouth. Elephants will also stretch out their trunk toward an approaching individual they intend to greet."

All representatives of the zebras are found exclusively in Africa, where they mostly inhabit open landscapes. There are several attempts to explain the evolutionary development of the stripes; a combination of several advantageous effects is also conceivable. On the one hand, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, among others, suspected that they could act as camouflage in tall grass or in hot, shimmering air. Because zebras live in herds, this could make it harder for predators to single out prey. According to another hypothesis tested experimentally, the stripes formed to camouflage against tsetse flies and horseflies. Other scientists suspect that the strips are used for thermoregulation."

The name 'giant panda' is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas are generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. The low nutrition quality of bamboo means pandas need to eat more frequently, and due to their lack of major predators they can be active at any time of the day."

It is easily identified by its markings, most notably the light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its hindquarters. It is covered in black hair, except for the tips of its ears, which, as with other tapirs, are rimmed with white. The pattern is for camouflage; the disrupted coloration breaks up its outline and makes it more difficult to recognize; other animals may mistake it for a large rock, rather than prey, when it is lying down to sleep.

 dubois.146.f: "The snow leopard, commonly known as the ounce, is native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. The snow leopard shows several adaptations for living in a cold, mountainous environments. Its small rounded ears help to minimize heat loss. It is solitary and mostly active at dawn till early morning, and again in afternoons and early evenings. Snow leopards cannot roar despite its partly ossified hyoid bone, as their 9 mm (0.35 in) short vocal folds provide little resistance to airflow. The snow leopard's vocalizations include meowing, grunting, prusten and moaning. They can purr when exhaling. The snow leopard is widely used in heraldry and as an emblem in Central Asia. They have long been used as a political symbol, the Aq Bars ('White Leopard'), by Tatars, Kazakhs, and Bulgars."

 dubois.147.f: "The cheetah is the fastest land animal in the world. In a short period of time during a chase, a cheetah may produce 60 times more heat than at rest, with much of the heat produced from glycolysis, stored to possibly raise the body temperature. The Asiatic cheetah once ranged from sub-Saharan North Africa across Central Asia to India. During the course of the 19th century, the range of the Asiatic cheetah continued to decline before it became extinct in almost all regions except for a small region in Iran. As early as the First World War, Indian princes had cheetahs imported from Africa, as the local species was almost extinct."

 dubois.148.f: "The red pandas are a genus of mammals native to the eastern Himalayas and southwest China and feed primarily on bamboo. Contrary to current assumptions in this direction, the genus is not closely related to the giant panda. In shape they look similar to a raccoon, but are slimmer. Their fur is long and soft, reddish-brown to copper-red on the top, sometimes with a yellowish tinge, and shiny black on the bottom. The face can be individually colored - it is mainly reddish brown with white tear streaks, the muzzle is short and the nose is naked and pitch black. Little pandas are very skilled and acrobatic climbers. While they go in search of food in the evening and at night, during the day they usually sleep stretched out in the forks of trees, in tree cavities they curl up and put their tails in front of their faces to protect them. They are very sensitive to heat; temperatures above 25 °C can be very difficult for them."

The dorsoventrally flattened body of C. mydas is covered by a large, teardrop-shaped carapace; it has a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific populations, parts of the carapace can be almost black. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses. Like other sea turtles, green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. Green sea turtles may live to 90 years in the wild."

 dubois.152.f: "The giant oceanic manta ray (Mobula birostris) is a species of ray in the family Mobulidae, and the largest type of ray in the world. It is circumglobal and is typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, but can also be found in temperate waters. The giant oceanic manta ray can grow up to 9 m (30 ft) in maximum length and to a disc size of 7 m (23 ft) across with a weight of about 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) but average size commonly observed is 4.5 m (15 ft). The skin is smooth with a scattering of conical and ridge-shaped tubercles. The colouring of the dorsal (upper) surface is black, dark brown, or steely blue, sometimes with a few pale spots and usually with a pale edge. Because of its large size and velocity in case of danger, the oceanic manta ray has very few natural predators that could be fatal to it."

This species is a very large kangaroo with long, pointed ears and a square shaped muzzle. They are sexually dimorphic as the males have short, red-brown fur, fading to pale buff below and on the limbs. Males grow up to a head-and-body length of 1.3-1.6 m (4 ft 3 in to 5 ft 3 in) with a tail that adds a further 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) to the total length and are referred to by Australians as 'Big Reds'. The red kangaroo's legs work much like a rubber band, with the Achilles tendon stretching as the animal comes down, then releasing its energy to propel the animal up and forward, enabling the characteristic bouncing locomotion. They can reach speeds of around 60 km/h (37 mph)."

 dubois.154.f: "The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxins that deter most other mammals from feeding on it. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala along with the kangaroos are recognised worldwide as symbols of Australia."

 dubois.155.f: "The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is one of the five extant species of monotremes, mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Like other monotremes, it senses prey through electrolocation. It is one of the few species of venomous mammals, as the male platypus has a spur on the hind foot that delivers a venom, capable of causing severe pain to humans. The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it. In 1799, the first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body judged it a fake, made of several animals sewn together. The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology, and a recognisable and iconic symbol of Australia."

The most common, the southern cassowary, is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller only than the ostrich and emu. Around 90% of the Cassowary diet consists of mainly fruit, although all species are opportunistic omnivores. Typically, all cassowaries are shy birds that are found in the deep forest. They are adept at disappearing long before a human knows they were there, but if provoked, they are capable of inflicting serious, even fatal, injuries to both dogs and people. The cassowary has often been labeled 'the world's most dangerous bird'."

The bulls are black-brown in color and reach heights of 2.45 meters; a shoulder mane makes them appear massive. The cows are more delicate: they are light brown and at most 2 meters long. The colonies are found in southern New Zealand on the sub-Antarctic islands: the Auckland Islands, the Snares Islands and Campbell Island. 95 percent of the world stocks are found in three colonies on the Auckland Islands. In the 19th century, many sea lions were killed by sealers. The sea lions of the Auckland Islands were completely wiped out in just twenty years after the islands were discovered in 1806. Today, the Auckland Islands are a deserted seal sanctuary where populations have largely recovered."

The National Museum, which had previously housed natural history, had resisted this move along with its leadership. For many, natural history was merely a subordinate department. It was thanks to Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_paleontologist_scope').GetLastName] that he used his contacts in the government and pursued his idea without compromise. Especially paleontological research will benefit from this in the future, and visitors have already expressed their great interest in extinct creatures, as well as asking questions about the origin of man. Paleontology, formerly a purely ancillary science or temporary occupation of geologists, has now become an established science with its own institutions and a reputation that puts it on a par with other natural sciences."

Since sharks produce a large number of teeth because of their revolver teeth, these are among the most frequently found fossils. As early as 1616, Fabio Colonna was able to show in his treatise De Glossopetris Dissertatio that the supposed viper tongues are in fact shark teeth. Squalicorax pristodontus had flat, triangular teeth, up to a maximum of three centimeters long. The cutting edges were finely serrated like today in the tiger shark. In the Cretaceous period, the genus Squalicorax was distributed worldwide. Fossilized teeth have been found in Mesozoic sediments in the Americas, Africa, Japan, Australia, India, Russia, the Middle East and Europe."

The animals resembled today's insectivores and lived from the Upper Paleocene to the Lower Eocene 59 to 48 million years ago. Evidence is mainly known from North America, more rarely from Europe. Important finds, including some complete skeletons, come from the north-west of the USA. The fossil butte member of the Green River Formation with an age of about 52 million years and the stratigraphically somewhat older Willwood Formation are particularly outstanding. Representatives of Palaeosinopa were characterized by a robust physique and a long tail. The shorter front legs compared to the longer hind legs appeared rather primitive. Due to the physique, a semi-aquatic way of life is reconstructed for the animals, the structure of the teeth in turn speaks for predominantly animal food. As a result, Palaeosinopa seems to have inhabited a habitat similar to that of today's otters."

Mine management was concerned that a paleontological dig could interfere with the work. And indeed, after a brief inspection of the finds, Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_paleontologist_scope').GetLastName] should determine that the work in the shaft would have to be postponed in favor of a professional scientific excavation. The industrialists have already protested. The fossil find thus becomes a political issue. Because the intelligentsia is now also highly interested and insists on excavating the fossils. Mediating voices are considering avoiding an excavation and just keeping records, which would not affect the mining work and might be a good political compromise, but would mean that we would not be able to salvage the fossils ourselves."

Composita had a cosmopolitan global distribution, having lived on every continent except Antarctica.Composita had a smooth shell with a more or less distinct fold and sulcus and a round opening for the pedicle on the pedicle valve. Composita is included in the family Athyrididae (Order Athyridida) and placed in the subfamily Spirigerellinae. Only philistines would recognize a mere shell in this time-honoured fossil."

They existed for almost the entire span of the Paleozoic, from the 2nd series of the Cambrian (starting 521 million years ago) to the mass extinction event at the end of the Permian, about 251 million years ago. Large numbers of their exoskeletons, reinforced with calcite (calcium carbonate), have been preserved as fossils, making it possible to reconstruct the evolution and variety of forms of the numerous species. This, combined with their stratigraphic persistence and wide geographical range, makes trilobites important index fossils for the Paleozoic, particularly the Cambrian. The extinct class of Trilobita consists of nine recognized orders, over 150 families, over 5000 genera, and more than 15,000 described species."

The number of species may have been around 30,000 to 40,000. The size of the shell of adult animals is usually in the range of 1 to 30 cm. From their first appearance in the Lower Devonian to their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous (Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary), ammonites represent a large number of index fossils over a period of about 350 million years; in part, the chronological delimitation of marine sediments is carried out exclusively on the basis of ammonites. They are therefore of great importance for geology and paleontology. The taxon Ammonoidea was first mentioned in 1884 by Karl Alfred von Zittel in his Handbook on Paleontology. The name comes from antiquity, Pliny the Elder referred to fossils as 'Ammonis cornua' (Ammon's horns)."

 dubois.303.f: "The atlas moth (Attacus atlas) is a butterfly (moth) from the family of peacock moths (Saturniidae). It is one of the largest butterflies in the world and was named after the Titan Atlas from Greek mythology. Females grow larger than males. Fagara silk is made from the cocoons of the Atlas moth. It is light brown and much more robust than ordinary silk."
 dubois.304.t: "Amorphophallus titanum"
 dubois.304.d: "In Indonesia, Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] discovered a gigantic Titan Arum, probably the largest flower in the world. The naturalist is delighted, the rest of the expedition complains about the terrible smell."
 dubois.304.f: "The genus Amorphophallus is distributed with around 200 species in the rain forests of the Old World from New Guinea to West Africa. A. titanum produces the largest unbranched inflorescence in the plant kingdom. The flower, which is more than three meters high, smells like carrion, produces heat (up to 37 °C) and thus attracts beetles, which take care of pollination. The spectacular flowering events of Titan Arum are a major attraction in botanical gardens worldwide."
 dubois.305.t: "Goliath"
 dubois.305.d: "The discovery of a goliath beetle pulls Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] briefly from his botanical research."
 dubois.305.f: "The Goliath beetles (Goliathus) represent a genus of beetles from the subfamily of the rose chafers (Cetoniinae). Goliath beetles are among the largest insects on Earth, if measured in terms of size, bulk and weight. With a larval weight of up to 110 grams, the goliath beetle is the heaviest insect of all. Dead bugs are very popular with collectors and fetch high prices on the market."
 dubois.306.t: "New species of orchids"
 dubois.306.d: "The Botanical Expedition has discovered and cataloged several new orchid species deep in the rainforest."
 dubois.306.f: "No other plant family has such a spectrum of flower shapes and colors as the orchid family. The size of the flowers varies from a few millimeters to 20 centimeters and more per flower. The color spectrum ranges from soft white to green and blue tones to strong red and yellow tones. Many of the orchid flowers are multicolored. After the daisy family, the orchids are the second largest family of flowering plants. About 1000 genera with 15,000 to 30,000 species are recognized by botanists."
 dubois.306.g: "More specimens never hurt."
 dubois.307.t: "Medicinal plants"
 dubois.307.d: "The research expedition in the rainforest has found some amazing herbs that may have medicinal uses."
 dubois.307.f: "Numerous medicinal substances have a herbal background - more than half to be precise. The most well-known example is aspirin and its active ingredient acetylsalicylic acid, which has been extracted from the bark of willow trees for centuries. This contains the active ingredient salicin, which is converted to salicylic acid in the body and develops its pain-relieving and fever-reducing effect there. In the 19th century, today's aspirin was successfully developed from salicylic acid."
 dubois.307.g: "Study the plants."
 dubois.307.h: "Collect the plants."
 dubois.308.t: "Beautiful, unknown flowers"
 dubois.308.d: "While exploring an unknown part of the rainforest, the botanical expedition came across numerous unknown flowers."
 dubois.308.f: "Despite their beauty, however, the [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetFullName] expedition leader hesitates before picking them. The locals consider the plants cursed; an indication that they might be poisonous. The idea is that helpers should pick the plants en masse, without considering the future consequences for their health. Certainly it would also be possible for Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] to research and collect the plants first, but this could also have unknown consequences."
 dubois.308.g: "The expedition crew should collect these flowers."
 dubois.308.h: "The expedition leader should collect these flowers."

 dubois.310.d: "Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] poisoned himself while doing his botanical work in the rainforest. The serious illness forces him to interrupt his work."
 dubois.310.f: "As long as our naturalist is ill, he is stuck on the Botanical Expedition and cannot be recalled. He will not send back any new specimens while sick."
 dubois.310.g: "Worrying."
 dubois.311.t: "Exotic seeds"
 dubois.311.d: "During the Botanical Expedition, Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] found some special seeds that are of great scientific and agricultural interest."
 dubois.311.f: "The exchange of crops between different parts of the world was already normal in the early modern period. For example, sugar cane from the Mediterranean region was cultivated extensively in South America. Conversely, the Briton Henry Wickham smuggled rubber seeds from Brazil to Asia in 1876."
 dubois.311.g: "The seeds will do well in the scientific collection."
 dubois.311.h: "The new seeds are to be used in agriculture."

 dubois.411.t: "Climbers wanted"
 dubois.411.d: "Some experienced climbers and courageous men have already been recruited to take part in the daring summit attempt. The question remains as to which leader we entrust to this enterprise."
 dubois.411.f: "The selection of the expedition leader is of crucial importance for the weal and woe of the mountain trip. In low mountains, his skills are not particularly in demand, but from an altitude of 3,000 meters at the latest, a lot depends on the skills and characteristics of the leader. Climbers, explorers and commanders with mountain experience are just as helpful as courage, persistence and meticulousness. Poor health and old age, in turn, have the opposite effect."

 dubois.412.d: "The team for the ascent to the summit has been assembled. But the question now arises: which mountain should the troupe climb under [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName]? There are several states we can choose from."
 dubois.412.f: "There are up to three possible mountain ranges to choose from. Their heights and difficulties differ. Mountains less than 3,000 meters - such as the Scottish Highlands and the Appalachian Mountains - are considered easy mountains that can be conquered in a few steps and without major dangers. The Alps, Pyrenees and Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, are more difficult to master and take longer. Mountains over 5,000 meters are considered challenges, and the Himalayas will not normally be manageable in this age."

 dubois.413.t: "Scientific Companion"
 dubois.413.d: "Climbing a previously unknown peak also has its appeal for science. Geologists, naturalists, and paleontologists are potential scientific companions."
 dubois.413.f: "Geologists in particular can gather numerous new findings for science on mountain expeditions. Naturalists study flora and fauna and collect specimens; Paleontologists can collect fossils, but the yield remains rather small."
 dubois.413.g: "A scientist is not required."
 dubois.413.h: "A geologist like [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_geologist_scope').GetFullName] would be the best choice."
 dubois.413.i: "Our naturalist [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetFullName] will be useful."

 dubois.414.t: "On, up to the Mountain!"
 dubois.414.d: "The climbers, led by [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName], have reached the mountain range in [SCOPE.sState('dubois_summit_location').GetName] and are beginning to prepare for the ascent."
 dubois.414.f: "'Why did you want to climb Mount Everest?' This question was asked of George Leigh Mallory, who was with both expeditions toward the summit of the world's highest mountain, in 1921 and 1922, and who is now in New York. He plans to go again in 1924, and he gave as the reason for persisting in these repeated attempts to reach the top: 'Because it's there.'"
 dubois.414.g: "The mountains are calling and I must go."

 dubois.420.t: "The Summit"
 dubois.420.d: "After an arduous ascent, the group of mountaineers finally reaches the summit. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName] is the first man to storm this spot on earth for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]. Now there is nothing left but to savor this moment of triumph."
 dubois.420.f: "The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this, 'What is the use of climbing Mount Everest?' and my answer must at once be: 'It is no use.' There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.\n\nOh, we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes, and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation. But otherwise nothing will come of it. We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, not a gem, nor any coal or iron. We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. It's no use.\n\nSo, if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward, then you won't see why we go. What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy.\n\nAnd joy is, after all, the end of life. We do not live to eat and make money. We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life. That is what life means and what life is for.'- George Leigh Mallory"
 dubois.420.g: "Let's enjoy the dawn!"
 dubois.421.t: "Mountaineering Disaster!"
 dubois.421.d: "While climbing the mountains in [SCOPE.sState('dubois_summit_location').GetName], [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName] made a terrible mistake, which ended the expedition in a catastrophe - several people died, provisions and equipment fell down with them. The whole nation is in shock!"
 dubois.421.f: "'Every night, do you understand, I see my comrades of the Matterhorn slipping on their backs, their arms outstretched, one after the other, in perfect order at equal distances—Croz the guide, first, then Hadow, then Hudson, and lastly Douglas. Yes, I shall always see them ...'- Edward Whymper"
 dubois.421.g: "A tragedy!"
 dubois.422.t: "Climb aborted"
 dubois.422.d: "The attempt to reach the highest peak in [SCOPE.sState('dubois_summit_location').GetName] has failed for the time being. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName] is forced to abandon the venture and return."
 dubois.422.f: "There can be multiple reasons why a climber abandons the ascent. Sometimes a change in the weather is enough; sometimes a supposed access to the summit turns out to be too treacherous. An ascent often takes too long and exceeds a time window because certain times of the day and changes make the ascent difficult or impossible. And sometimes you simply chose the wrong path."
 dubois.422.g: "Disappointing."
 dubois.423.t: "Mountain Troops"
 dubois.423.d: "Because of his impressive experience in mountain conquering and mountain defense, [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_veteran').GetFullName] decided to use his superior skills to create an elite unit of mountain troops."
 dubois.423.f: "The Gebirgsjäger, the Alpini or the Chasseurs Alpins are just a few examples of elite troops from some countries who have specialized in war on the heights. Established in 1872, the Alpini are the oldest active mountain infantry in the world. Their original mission was to protect Italy's border with France and Austria-Hungary."
 dubois.423.g: "They will carry his legacy into the future."
 dubois.424.t: "A Mountain Symphony"
 dubois.424.d: "Inspired by the recent success of our mountaineering troupe, our composer has announced that he wants to write a major musical work about the mountains and man's struggle against nature. The music world is already in agreement that this will be an important work."
 dubois.424.f: "An Alpine Symphony op. 64 is a symphonic poem by the composer Richard Strauss, which was first performed in 1915. The work is based on the composer's concept of using musical means to depict the ascent of an Alpine peak and the return to the valley in one day. The idea for the program goes back to an experience from Strauss' childhood. In the summer of 1879 he lost his footing in the Heimgarten in the Bavarian Alps and was caught in a thunderstorm. The next day he presented this event at the piano. From this memory he developed the concept. It was the composer's declared intention to enable the listener to experience the stages of a mountain hike as a sound painting in an immediately sensual way. According to many music critics, the work achieves this goal in an impressive manner."
 dubois.424.g: "Hopefully there won't be any alpenhorns in it."

 dubois.430.t: "An Easy Climb"
 dubois.430.d: "The mountaineering team is making easy progress on the lower level of the mountain range in [SCOPE.sState('dubois_summit_location').GetName]. There are no notable occurrences."
 dubois.430.f: "'He is lucky who, in the full tide of life, has experienced a measure of the active environment he most desires. In these days of upheaval and violent change, when the basic values of to-day are the vain and shattered dreams of to-morrow, there is much to be said for a philosophy which aims at living a full life while the opportunity offers. There are few treasures of more lasting worth than the experience of a way of life that is in itself wholly satisfying. Such, after all, are the only possessions of which no fate, no cosmic catastrophe can deprive us; nothing can alter the fact if for one moment in eternity we have really lived.' -Eric Shipton"
 dubois.430.g: "Go ahead!"
 dubois.431.t: "A Slope"
 dubois.431.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName] has spotted a small slope in the mountains, but this shouldn't pose a major problem for the climbers."
 dubois.431.f: "The higher a mountaineering team climbs, the greater the challenges. A slope can be an initial obstacle, but should not be a problem for a moderately well-equipped expedition."
 dubois.431.g: "The team will master this."
 dubois.431.h: "This is too risky."
 dubois.432.t: "Steep Wall"
 dubois.432.d: "A cliff presents a major obstacle for climbers on their trek to the summit, but [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName] is confident that he will master this task."
 dubois.432.f: "From mountains with an altitude of 2,000 meters, the mountaineering group can encounter cliffs. For low mountains they are the last obstacle before the summit, but in many cases it is more of a warm-up program. From here on, a normal mountain hike differs from a real mountain climb."
 dubois.433.t: "Avalanche!"
 dubois.433.d: "A dangerous avalanche has broken loose in the heights of [SCOPE.sState('dubois_summit_location').GetName], threatening the mountaineering endeavor. With debris now threatening the direct route, finding an alternate route might be safer, but cost valuable time. Some climbers suggest waiting - which includes the possibility that the trail could become more blocked."
 dubois.433.f: "Avalanches occur from snow-covered heights and have been a danger to everyone who lived in the mountains since time immemorial - not just summiteers. Their treacherous nature has already led many to their deaths. From now on the wheat is separated from the chaff."
 dubois.433.g: "That cannot shake a climber."
 dubois.433.h: "Search an alternative route."
 dubois.434.t: "Abyss"
 dubois.434.d: "A dangerous gorge opens up in front of [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName] when he has reached the last rock formation. The seemingly insurmountable obstacle poses a challenge for the mountaineers."
 dubois.434.f: "'Alpinism is the art of climbing mountains by confronting the greatest dangers with the greatest prudence. Art is used here to mean the accomplishment of knowledge in action. You cannot always stay on the summits. You have to come down again. So what's the point? Only this: what is above knows what is below, what is below does not know what is above. One climbs, one sees. One descends, one sees no longer, but one has seen. While climbing, take note of all the difficulties along your path. During the descent, you will no longer see them, but you will know that they are there if you have observed carefully.' -René Daumal"
 dubois.435.t: "Weather Change"
 dubois.435.d: "A change in the weather in the mountains of [SCOPE.sState('dubois_summit_location').GetName] presents mountaineers with a life-threatening problem. There is still a window of opportunity to reach a more sheltered location at higher altitudes, but it is a dangerous undertaking. The mountaineers would find safe shelter in the base camp - but that would ruin the progress of the last few days, if not weeks."
 dubois.435.f: "Weather changes in the mountains can be one of the most threatening events that can happen on a mountain tour. This applies to rain, storms and snow. Particularly at the highest altitudes, a sudden snowfall can mean that a summit attempt has to be aborted because the unpredictable elements can end in a tragedy."
 dubois.435.h: "Back to the last camp!"
 dubois.436.t: "Death Step"
 dubois.436.d: "Shortly before the summit, [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName] is confronted with one last, ultimate challenge: a cliff towering almost vertically in front of him decides victory or defeat. The climbers are already rumoring that this is a death trap; or a death step."
 dubois.436.f: "'After an hour's steady going we reached the foot of the most formidable-looking problem on the ridge - a rock step some forty feet high. We realised that at this altitude it might well spell the difference between success and failure. The rock itself, smooth and almost holdless, might have been an interesting Sunday afternoon problem for a group of expert rock climbers in the Lake District, but here it was a barrier beyond our feeble strength to overcome. I could see no way of turning it on the steep rock bluff on the west, but fortunately another possibility of tackling it still remained. On its east side was another great cornice, and running up the full forty feet of the step was a narrow crack between the cornice and the rock. Leaving Tenzing to belay me as best he could, I jammed my way into this crack, then kicking backwards with my crampons I sank their spikes deep into the frozen snow behind me and levered myself off the ground. Taking advantage of every little rock hold and all the force of knee, shoulder and arms I could muster, I literally cramponed backwards up the crack, with a fervent prayer that the cornice would remain attached to the rock.' -Edmund Hillary"
 dubois.437.t: "Lack of Oxygen"
 dubois.437.d: "[SCOPE.sState('dubois_summit_location').GetName]'s unusual heights push mountaineers to their limits. The lack of oxygen threatens the ascent to the summit."
 dubois.437.f: "In high mountains, atmospheric pressure is lower and this means that less oxygen is available to breathe. This is the underlying cause of altitude sickness. Everyone needs to acclimatise, even exceptional mountaineers that have been to high altitude before. Generally speaking, mountaineers start using bottled oxygen when they climb above 7,000 m. Exceptional mountaineers have climbed 8000-metre peaks (including Everest) without oxygen, almost always with a carefully planned program of acclimatisation."
 dubois.437.g: "Good that we have our oxygen bottles with us."
 dubois.437.h: "Cancel the expedition before worse happens."

 dubois.438.d: "A group of stragglers fell while climbing the last rock face and sustained serious injuries. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName] must decide how to proceed."
 dubois.438.f: "Mountaineers face a variety of hazards. When climbing mountains, there are two types of hazards, objective (mountain-based) and subjective (human-based). Subjective hazards relate to a climber's poor judgement, poor planning, lack of skills, faulty analysis and conclusions, or inadequate conditioning. From 1947 to 2018 in the United States 2,799 people were reported to be involved in mountaineering accidents and 43% of these accidents resulted in death."
 dubois.438.g: "Good that we have modern medical equipment."
 dubois.438.h: "We wait until they recover."
 dubois.439.t: "Rope Team"
 dubois.439.d: "In order to secure an ascent, the climbers must form a rope group. The slope looks anything but safe. The endeavor requires careful planning."
 dubois.439.f: "The term rope team originally comes from mountain sports, especially climbing, and refers to a group of people connected by a mountain or climbing rope and thus secured against falling. By using a shared safety rope, a rope team offers its members mutual protection against falls. At the same time, a rope team also forms a danger community, because under unfavorable conditions, a fall by a single member can lead to the entire rope team falling."
 dubois.439.g: "Good that we have modern organization."

 dubois.440.f: "Scientists had often studied the unusual flora and fauna of the area in the early stages of mountain expeditions. Geological investigations were of particular interest - not only for general scientific reasons, but also often to simplify future climbs."
 dubois.440.g: "For Science!"
 dubois.441.t: "A Lost Animal"
 dubois.441.d: "On the lower level of the Himalayas, our naturalist [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_scientist').GetFullName] has made a strange discovery: a single, abandoned animal roams there, stricken by hunger and cold."
 dubois.441.f: "It was a strange sight for Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_scientist').GetLastName] to find such a small, tender creature, who was otherwise said to live in the bamboo forests of Nepal, in this deserted wasteland. He knew illustrations from books and knew that locals lived in the nearest forests; but how could a single animal get here? Over this distance? Without food? It remained a mystery. Had the little red panda also caught the mountaineering bug? Or had he fled from predators? Be that as it may, the naturalist takes care of the exhausted animal and nurses it back to health. A sight that the [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_mountain_expedition_leader').GetFullName] doesn't like: he sees the mountain climb threatened by such zoological sentimentality. It is agreed that the research assistant will bring the red panda to the base camp - and from there prepare it for its journey to the local zoo."

 dubois.1000.t: "Le Carnaval des animaux"
 dubois.1000.d: "During his recent visit to the zoo, our composer was inspired in particular by the lion, the elephant, the kangaroo and the turtles for a humorous little work, which he christened 'Carnival of the Animals'."
 dubois.1000.f: "The 'Carnival of the Animals', subtitled Grande fantaisie zoologique, was composed by Camille Saint-Saëns in January 1886 in a small Austrian village. Here, in just a few days, he processed early sketches for the Carnaval, which date from a time when he was working as a teacher at a private music school in Paris, commissioned by Aristide Dietsch (1861/1865). When musical parodies were on the curriculum there, Saint-Saëns was persuaded by his students to realize one of his many ideas for a humorous piece of music. However, concerned about his reputation, Saint-Saëns decided not to publish the work for chamber orchestra. Because apart from the fact that the composer imitated animal calls through the instruments in the pieces, he had parodied several of his professional colleagues. Although the composers were dead by then, Saint-Saëns did not want to upset their admirers. The work was only published posthumously by its publisher Jacques Durand."

 dubois.1012.f1: "The Hippopotami were floating in the water in their enclosure. Not a lot was happening. You wondered if they ever did anything when a zookeeper appeared next to you.\n\n\"It is so fascinating how the Hippos usually just float around during the day. But after dusk they become very active and start to forage. But it's obvious if you know how hot it is in their natural habitat. The water cools them during the day and in the evening and night they can finally start roaming around.\""
 dubois.1012.f2: "Suddenly a Hippo emerged from the water. You haven't seen that one before, even though you were watching the enclosure for multiple minutes. It must have been in the water for quite some time.\n\nA person next to you started speaking: \"Isn't it fascinating? Those Hippos can stay under water for five minutes. When they submerge, their nostrils and ears are shut, so no water can enter.\""
 dubois.1012.f3: "One of the Hippopotami opened its huge mouth and showed its long, curved teeth. Then it started grunting and splashing.\n\nYou once read that male Hippos do this to warn off rivals, as they are very protective of their territory. Male Hippos use their feces to mark specific points in their territory as well. Someties they even stare at other male hippos as a form of dominance."

 dubois.1013.t: "Lion Enclosure"
 dubois.1013.d: "A pack of #o Lions#! can be found in the lion enclosure. The enclosure features a tree for shade and a small pond for drinking."
 dubois.1013.f1: "The magnificent lions was laying in the middle of its pride. The mane of the male lion was big and quite dark. Suddenly the lion yawned and showed its teeth.\n\nApparently the mane of the male lions grows longer and longer reaching up to 16 cm. The older the lion gets, the darker its mane becomes. The mane probably has two main purposes: To attract females and to pretect the lion's throat and neck during fights. The thickness of the mane depends on the temperatures in the lion's habitat. In colder regions the manes are far heavier for lions living in zoos in Europe and North America."
 dubois.1013.f2: "At first it was only one Lion roaring but then the others joined in. With each Lion the roaring got louder and louder. Then, suddenly, they stopped all at once.\n\nLions usually live in prides of related animals. The majority of the females stay in the same pride their entire life, while the males usually join other prides or coalitions of other male lions. In the pride the females are usually the hunters having a way higher chance of catching prey. The males have about a 10% chance of actually catching their prey. But when they catch a big animal, lions can eat up to 40 kg of meat."
 dubois.1013.f3: "In the confines of a zoo, the mighty lion paces back and forth within its enclosure. Its muscular body exudes power and grace as it surveys its surroundings. The lion's restless movements catch your attention, prompting you to ponder the secrets behind its behavior. As you ponder, a knowledgeable zookeeper approaches, ready to share insights about these magnificent creatures.\n\n\"It's fascinating to observe the lions in their enclosure,\" the zookeeper begins. \"During the day, they often engage in repetitive pacing, a behavior that can be seen both in captive lions and their wild counterparts. This pacing is believed to be a result of their natural instinct to patrol and mark their territory, even in the absence of vast grasslands or expansive landscapes.\""
 dubois.1013.f4: "At the zoo, [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_prinz_eugen').GetFullName] is known for checking on the old lion in the enclosure every day. The veteran feels a deep connection to the animal. Both seem like witnesses to times past of glory and honor. Zoo visitors say there is a bond between this specific animal and the man.\n\nBut finally three days came when the lion no longer saw his master, he refused to eat anything and paced restlessly up and down in the enclosure. At around three in the morning he let out such a roar that the animal keeper ran out into the enclosure to see. At the same time he heard the death knell ring in the chapel and so he knew that his master, the great General [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_prinz_eugen').GetLastName], had died at that very hour. It's the stuff that touches even the hardest hearts of soldiers."
  
 dubois.1014.t: "Elephant Enclosure"
 dubois.1014.d: "In a vast enclosure the Elephants are roaming around. They are one of the biggest attractions of the Zoo and there are always people watching them."
 dubois.1014.f1: "You were observing the Elephants for quite some time. One of them stroke out to you. It was a huge female Elephant with long tusks. She seemed to take the lead sometimes and the other Elephants seemed to respect her a lot.\n\n\"I see you found the Matriarch of the Elephants!\", you didn't even notice that a zookeeper was standing next to you, \""These majestic creatures live in tight-knit family units known as herds. Within the herd, you'll often find a matriarch, a wise and experienced female who leads and protects the group. In their family, the Elephants have strong social bonds. They even mourn the loss of one of their group. Luckily we didn't have an Elephant death in years!\""
 dubois.1014.f2: "One of the Elephants was trumpeting. It sounded great! You would probably even have heard it from hundreds of meters away.\n\nIt reminded you of a text you once read about elephants: "One of the Elephants was trumpeting. It sounded great! You would probably even have heard it from hundreds of meters away.\n\nIt reminded you of a text you once read about elephants: "African elephants possess an incredible ability to communicate over long distances. Through a variety of vocalizations, such as trumpets, rumbles, and roars, they convey information to other members of their herd, whether it's a warning of danger or a call to regroup.\""
 dubois.1014.f3: "One of the Elephants came closer to you. Its trunk slowly approached you. Wasn't that the Elephant you fed some food a year ago? No, that couldn't be. It would have forgotten you by now! Nonetheless you gave the elephant a fruit you brought for yourself.\n\n\"I think she remembers you.\", a zookeeper was standing next to you, \"Elephants can remember things over years, even decades. It's fascinating, sometimes they remember a visitor and act accordingly. Once an Elephant took some woman's purse because she threw a stone at the Elephant as a child. They have an astonishing recall of locations, water sources, and even individuals they have encountered. This remarkable memory helps them navigate their environment and maintain strong social connections.\""
  
 dubois.1015.t: "Giraffe Enclosure"
 dubois.1015.d: "The Giraffes were visible from far away. Their heads reached high above the ground to get some fresh leaves from the trees."
 dubois.1015.f1: "The giraffe's blue tongue curled around the green branches in your hand. In the process, the tongue slid over your hand. It was rough and very long.\n\nYou remember something that you once read in a book: The giraffe's tongue was perfectly adapted to its environment. It was designed to graze the acacia leaves from the branch without getting hurt by the thorns. To eat the 30 kilograms of leaves per day, the giraffe has to tear leaves from the trees for up to 12 hours. At the same time, the leaves also cover a large part of the giraffe's water needs."
 dubois.1015.f2: "Two of the Giraffes stood side by side when they suddenly started to hit each others sides with their heads. Their long neck allowed them to fling their head and aim for their opponent. What could cause such savage behaviour?\n\n\"Don't be afraid! This is a natural behaviour.\", a zookeeper stood next to you and started to explain, \"Giraffes are social animals that form loose-knit herds. These herds are often composed of females and their young, with occasional bachelor groups of young males. Within the herd, giraffes engage in various forms of social interaction, including necking, a behavior where males engage in gentle sparring to establish dominance or gain mating rights. That's exactly what you just saw!\""
 dubois.1015.f3: "You listened to a zookeeper talking about the Giraffes with a group of people: \"Giraffes have a distinct coat pattern that resembles a mosaic of irregular patches. These patterns, which vary among individuals, help Giraffes camouflage themselves within their surroundings, providing them with a measure of protection against predators. Apart from that the lighter stripes help the Giraffe to cool down. If they only had dark hair, they would overheat in the savannah.\""

"These penguins are endemic to the coastlines of Southern Africa, specifically found in the waters surrounding Namibia and South Africa. Unlike their counterparts in Antarctica, African Penguins thrive in a warmer climate, making them well-suited to the coastal regions they call home.\""
 dubois.1016.f2: "You watch as a penguin struggles with a rock. Parts of the rock fly away, so it must be soft rock. You watch with interest as the penguin continues to dig.\n\nDidn't you read something about that? The African penguins dig a nesting cave in guano deposits. This guano comes from the droppings of hundreds of generations of birds. In South Africa there are large deposits of guano where the penguins nest. Thereby the partners take turns in breeding."
 dubois.1016.f3: "As you marvel at the penguins' playful splashes in the water, a zookeeper shares a fascinating detail: \"One unique characteristic of African Penguins is their exceptional swimming ability. They are agile and streamlined underwater, relying on their flippers to propel themselves through the ocean in search of small fish and squid, which make up the majority of their diet. Their waterproof feathers and dense layer of blubber provide insulation, allowing them to withstand the cold ocean temperatures.\""

Belonging to the group of herbivorous dinosaurs known as ankylosaurids, this prehistoric creature is celebrated for its distinctive and impressive defensive adaptations.\nCharacterized by a robust and heavily armored body, Ankylosaurus possessed a broad, low-slung profile adorned with bony plates, or osteoderms, embedded in its skin, offering formidable protection against potential predators. Its most iconic feature was the tail club, formed by a dense knob of bone at the tip of its tail, which likely served as both a deterrent against attackers and a tool for intraspecific combat.\nWith a length of around 20 to 30 feet, Ankylosaurus was a quadrupedal herbivore, utilizing its broad beak to crop vegetation. Its relatively small head, when compared to its substantial body, indicates selective feeding habits on low-lying plants and shrubs."

 dubois.901.d: "The preparations for what is possibly the most important scientific congress of the past and future years have been completed.

Invitations will be sent to all naturalists in the world. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_naturalist_scope').GetLastName] will chair the session."
 dubois.901.f: "In the course of the 19th century, the dispute over the taxonomic classification of humans came to a head in connection with the formulation of the theory of evolution. Although it had long been known that humans were similar to great apes, and Carl Linnaeus had already placed them in the order of primates, there were several reservations. In order to emphasize the uniqueness of humans, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach distinguished him from all other primates as "two-handed" (Bimana) from "four-handed" (Quadrumana). This classification, although quite recent, gained popularity in academic circles, such as the influential British paleontologist Richard Owen. For the supporters of the theory of evolution this was an untenable situation and for anatomists a horror - it meant that, according to this order, a gorilla was closer to a steppe baboon than a human being."

Apparently it is no longer the scientific question as such that has gained the upper hand, but rather the associated implications."
 dubois.904.f: "After morphological elements were first brought into the field, the debate came to a head on a particular aspect of anatomy: the brain. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_hippocampus_defender_scope').GetFullName] presented several papers on the anatomical differences between apes and humans, stressing the impossibility of apes being transmuted into men. He asserted that humans were not merely a distinct biological order of primates, but a separate sub-class of mammalia, distinct from all the other primates and mammals generally. Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_hippocampus_defender_scope').GetLastName] based this classification on three characteristics, the most important being his claim that only the human brain has a hippocampus minor. This was countered by [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_hippocampus_attacker_scope').GetFullName], who insisted that these supposedly unique features could indeed be found in great apes. When asked if he could live with the idea of being just a modified monkey, Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_hippocampus_attacker_scope').GetLastName] replied: 'It is as respectable to be modified monkey as modified dirt.'"

 dubois.906.f: "'He held very strange theories about a good many things. He had even got up once at the British Association, and declared that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have. Which was a shocking thing to say; for, if it were so, what would become of the faith, hope, and charity of immortal millions? You may think that there are other more important differences between you and an ape, such as being able to speak, and make machines, and know right from wrong, and say your prayers, and other little matters of that kind; but that is a child's fancy, my dear. Nothing is to be depended on but the great hippopotamus test.

Certainly, I never felt one in mine; but perhaps it's dead, and so didn't stir, and then of course, it don't count, you know. Everyone has brains in his head, unless he's a skeleton; and it curled its tail round things like a monkey, that I know, for I saw it with my own eyes. It was Professor Huxley said it was in his tail - not Mr. Huxley's, of course, but the ape's: only apes have no tails, so I don't quite see that. And then the other gentleman who got up last, Mr. Flower, you know, he said that it was all over the ape, everywhere. All over hippocampuses, from head to foot, poor beast, like a dog all over ticks! I wonder why they don't rub bluestone into the back of its neck, as one does to a pointer. Well, then. Where was I? Oh! and Professor Owen said it wasn't in apes at all: but only in the order bimana, that's you and me. Well, he know best. And they all know best too, for they are monstrous clever fellows.

 dubois.909.f_unique: "'In Man the brain presents an ascensive step in development, higher and more strongly marked than that by which the preceding subclass was distinguished from the one below it. Not only do the cerebral hemispheres overlap the olfactory lobes and cerebellum, but they extend in advance of the one, and further back than the other. Their posterior development is so marked, that anatomists have assigned to that part the character of a third lobe; it is peculiar to the genus Homo, and equally peculiar is the 'posterior horn of the lateral ventricle,' and the 'hippocampus minor,' which characterize the hind lobe of each hemisphere. The superficial grey matter of the cerebrum, through the number and depth of the convolutions, attains its maximum of extent in Man. Peculiar mental powers are associated with this highest form of brain, and their consequences wonderfully illustrate the value of the cerebral character; according to my estimate of which, I am led to regard the genus Homo, as not merely a representative of a distinct order, but of a distinct subclass of the Mammalia, for which I propose a name of 'ARCHENCEPHALA.'' -Richard Owen"
 dubois.909.f_primate: "'It is quite certain that the ape which most nearly approaches man is either the chimpanzee, or the gorilla. In the general proportions of the body and limbs there is a remarkable difference between the Gorilla and man in whatever proportion the Gorilla differs from man, the other apes depart still more widely from the Gorilla and that, consequently, such differences of proportion can have no ordinal value. In the important matter of cranial capacity, men differ more widely from one another than they do from the apes; while the lowest apes differ as much, in proportion, from the highest, as the latter does from man. Hence it is obvious that, greatly as the dentition of the highest ape differs from man, it differs far more widely from that of the lower and lowest apes. Thus, whatever system of organs be studied, the comparison of their modifications in the ape series leads to one and the same result—that the structural differences which separate Man from the Gorilla and the Chimpanzee are not so great as those which separate the Gorilla from the lower apes.' -Thomas Henry Huxley"

With the postulation of the ice age theory and subsequent geological and paleontological studies, which showed that the earth was significantly older than expected, interest in 'cavemen' increased. At the latest with the theory of evolution and the discovery of prehistoric bones that were more than a few thousand years old, the question of the place of origin of modern humans became more virulent."

 dubois.914.f: "In a stimulating debate, the respective advocates of the three camps exchanged their arguments. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_europe_defender_scope').GetLastName] brought Europe into the field because the finds so far showed the largest brain volume in European fossils. Since the larger brain preceded upright walking, this is inevitable. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_asia_defender_scope').GetLastName] doubted this theory. The fossils of upright walking, human-like representatives have already been found in Asia - the brain therefore only developed after walking upright. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_africa_defender_scope').GetLastName], on the other hand, pointed out that the known ape species that are closest to humans came from Africa, not Asia. As the inventor of the evolution theory had based it, the origin of humanity had to be found there."
 dubois.914.g: "Modern humans developed in Europe."
 dubois.914.h: "Everything points to an Asian origin."
 dubois.914.i: "The cradle of humanity lies in Africa."
 dubois.915.t: "Respected Speech"
 dubois.915.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_anthropologist_scope').GetFullName] gave a lecture to the assembled scientific staff in [SCOPE.sCountry('dubois_congress_host_country').GetName] that inspired the audience and young academics alike."
 dubois.915.f: "'The Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever.'\n -Konstantin Tsiolkovsky."
 dubois.915.g: "Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_anthropologist_scope').GetLastName] makes a considerable impression."
 dubois.916.t: "Valuable Contribution to the Debate"
 dubois.916.d: "A brilliant scientific lecture by Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_anthropologist_scope').GetFullName] broadened the horizons of the academic world at the science congress in [SCOPE.sCountry('dubois_congress_host_country').GetName]. It will probably have a long-lasting effect."
 dubois.916.f: "'He held very strange theories about a good many things. He had even got up once at the British Association, and declared that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have. Which was a shocking thing to say; for, if it were so, what would become of the faith, hope, and charity of immortal millions? You may think that there are other more important differences between you and an ape, such as being able to speak, and make machines, and know right from wrong, and say your prayers, and other little matters of that kind; but that is a child's fancy, my dear. Nothing is to be depended on but the great hippopotamus test. If you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, you are no ape, though you had four hands, no feet, and were more apish than the apes of all aperies.' -Charles Kingsley"
 dubois.917.t: "Mysterious Skull"
 dubois.917.d: "An amateur anthropologist showed up at the conference with an unknown fossil. He would like to sell it to the scientific society, but at a horrendous price. Many anthropologists reject the 'pig in a poke' approach."

 dubois.919.d_europe: "International science has agreed on a European origin of modern humanity. Non-European scholars have denounced this decision as suprematism."
 dubois.919.d_asia: "The International Anthropological Congress recently agreed on the compromise that humans must come from Asia. Most members of the Assembly agreed with this view."
 dubois.919.d_africa: "After a very controversial final debate, the scientists were able to agree by a narrow majority that the origin of humanity should be located in Africa."
 dubois.919.f_europe: "Historically, the question of the actual place of origin of humanity was not resolved at the beginning of the 20th century. While a small group, partly misled by the discovery of the so-called Piltdown Man, suspected the origin of modern man in Europe less for scientific than ideological reasons, the Asia theory had received the most support. The discoveries on Java and the recovery of the Peking Man played a large part in this. It was only from the middle of the 20th century that more and more African finds began to erode this view."

 dubois.921.t: "Paleontological Congress: Extinction of the Dinosaurs"
 dubois.921.d: "Our nation has the honor of preparing one of the most important congresses in paleontology. Scientists from around the world will flock to [SCOPE.sCountry('dubois_congress_host_country').GetName]  to answer the question of why the dinosaurs went extinct. [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_paleontologist_scope').GetFullName] has already chosen his favorite pith helmet to wear during his opening speech."
 dubois.921.f: "The question of what led to the extinction of the dinosaurs has plagued humanity since the day the first dinosaur bone was found and classified as part of an unknown species. Before the 19th century, people were content to dismiss dinosaurs as the animals that did not make it onto Noah's Ark at the Flood. As new geological and paleontological methods developed, the picture became more nuanced. The flood idea still lived on with Georges Cuvier, albeit in the opposite direction: he believed that the sea levels had sunk and that the lizards he had located in wetlands had lost their habitat. It was just one of numerous theories that would sprout up over the next century and a half - unsatisfactory answers."
 dubois.921.g: "Will this question ever be answered?"
 dubois.922.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('dubois_congress_host_country').GetName] has invited to an international science congress. The topic will be the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs. Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_paleontologist_scope').GetLastName] has received a warm invitation."
 dubois.922.f: "This will be the event of the decade."
 dubois.923.t: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_astronomer_scope').GetLastName]'s Revolutionary Theory"
 dubois.923.d: "Shortly before the start of the congress, our nation's most recognized astronomer, [SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_astronomer_scope').GetFullName], announced that he had his own idea of what could have led to the extinction of the dinosaurs: an asteroid impact! He asks that this thesis be spread among paleontologists."
 dubois.923.f: "Although Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_astronomer_scope').GetLastName] was not a paleontologist, he was familiar with cosmic phenomena - and knew about their destructive power. The 19th century had seen some amazing large comets in the sky, but at the same time, in the case of Tunguska, it had experienced what the extraterrestrial pieces of rock could do. The astronomer not only made theoretical calculations, but also had samples collected that contained unusual materials in certain rock layers, including those at the end of the Cretaceous period. In constant communication with Professor [SCOPE.sCharacter('dubois_paleontologist_scope').GetLastName], the two famous scientists exchanged their views and, with the help of the most modern physical knowledge, came to the conclusion that an asteroid impact was the most logical cause of the end of the dinosaur age - not so much because of the impact, but because of it the ecological and climatic consequences."
 dubois.923.g: "This is a fascinating idea."
 dubois.923.h: "This is completely absurd."
 dubois.924.t: "Why did the Dinosaurs die out?"
 dubois.924.d: "The paleontologists have come together - and opinions differ on the question of the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. There are not two or three camps - but a hodgepodge of theses that often differ only slightly in terms of probability and folly."
 dubois.924.f: "Since the discovery of dinosaurs, the most fantastic attempts to explain why dinosaurs disappeared from the earth have been circulating. Here is just a selection."
 dubois.924.a: "The reason was an asteroid impact."
 dubois.924.g: "The sea level dropped and destroyed habitats."
 dubois.924.h: "Oxygen contents of Earth's atmosphere rose to levels better suited for birds and mammals."
 dubois.924.i: "Maladaptive traits led to an evolutionary dead end."
 dubois.924.j: "Diminuition of sexual activity lead to extinction."
 dubois.924.k: "Pathological Gigantism!"
 dubois.924.l: "Competition with Mammals who ate their eggs."
 dubois.924.m: "Climate Change."
 dubois.924.n: "Volcanic Eruptions."
 dubois.924.o: "Bombardment from cosmic or ultraviolet radiation."
 dubois.924.p: "Dinosaur brain size diminished over the course of the Mesozoic until, in effect, they became too stupid to live."
 dubois.929.t: "Paleontological Congress ends"
 dubois.929.d_asteroid: "In a final declaration, the paleontological congress announced that it had come to a decision: the thesis that an asteroid impact sealed the end of the dinosaurs alone appears to be a convincing idea."
 dubois.929.d_climate: "With a dismayed sigh, the host country's professor began a lecture today that pointed out with dismay the extinction of dinosaurs due to climate change."
 dubois.929.d_sex: "Somewhat bashfully and with a lot of throat clearing, the chairman of the paleontological congress explainee that the lack of sexual reproduction was the reason for the demise of the dinosaurs. Professor Tottenham's interjection that he had always thought his wife was a Brontosaurus was rebuked in the minutes."
 dubois.929.d_mammals: "After days of discussion, paleontologists have come to the conclusion that competition with mammals heralded the end of the dinosaurs. They suspect that rodents would have preferred to eat dinosaur eggs."
 dubois.929.d_fat: "Today, in a tone of conviction, the chairman of the paleontological congress read out with all gravity a document that supported the belief that the dinosaurs had simply become too big and too fat, which led to their inevitable extinction. Professor Tottenham's comment that this meant that the chairman's seat would soon become vacant resulted in a public rebuke."
 dubois.929.d_stupid: "The final declaration read out today by the paleontological congress explains in detail that the brains of dinosaurs became smaller and smaller over the course of millions of years until, in the end, they were simply too stupid to survive. Professor Tottenham's statement that this would also have been desirable for some scientific colleagues before the congress was not included in the minutes."
 dubois.929.f: "This is what some important scientists of the 19th and early 20th centuries actually believed."
 dubois.929.g: "An asteroid impact was responsible."
 dubois.929.h: "An awkward theory, but the only one accepted."

The publication has already been recognized by a foundation for its new insights into the family tree of living things."
 dubois.261.f: "'I shall collect plants and fossils, and with the best of instruments make astronomic observations. Yet this is not the main purpose of my journey. I shall endeavor to find out how nature's forces act upon one another, and in what manner the geographic environment exerts its influence on animals and plants. In short, I must find out about the harmony in nature.' -Alexander von Humboldt"

 dubois.262.f: "'Absorbed in the special investigation, I paid no heed to the edifice which was meanwhile unconsciously building itself up. Having however completed the comparison of the fossil species in Paris, I wanted, for the sake of an easy revision of the same, to make a list according to their succession in geological formations, with a view of determining the characteristics more exactly and bringing them by their enumeration into bolder relief. What was my joy and surprise to find that the simplest enumeration of the fossil fishes according to their geological succession was also a complete statement of the natural relations of the families among themselves; that one might therefore read the genetic development of the whole class in the history of creation, the representation of the genera and species in the several families being therein determined; in one word, that the genetic succession of the fishes corresponds perfectly with their zoological classification, and with just that classification proposed by me.' -Louis Agassiz"

I cannot find words to express the pleasure I have in seeing, as I discovered one character, how all the consequences, which I predicted from it, were successively confirmed; the feet were found in accordance with the characters announced by the teeth; the teeth in harmony with those indicated beforehand by the feet; the bones of the legs and thighs, and every connecting portion of the extremities, were found set together precisely as I had arranged them, before my conjectures were verified by the discovery of the parts entire: in short, each species was, as it were, reconstructed from a single one of its component elements.' -William Buckland"
