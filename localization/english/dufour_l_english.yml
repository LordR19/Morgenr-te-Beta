#The two Appenzells do not implement the women's suffrage
 dufour.1000.t: "The two Appenzells do not implement the women's suffrage"
 dufour.1000.d: "Women's suffrage has been introduced in Switzerland. Unfortunately, some Cantons are a bit slow. In the Cantons of Appenzell Innerhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden, women are allowed to participate in federal votes and elections, but not in those of the municipalities and the Canton. It would first need an amendment to the Cantonal Constitution and this would have to be approved at a Landsgemeinde. The process could take several years. Should we intervene and force the people of Appenzell to introduce women's suffrage or wait and hope that they will introduce it themselves?"
 dufour.1000.f: "\"Surely our men are doing that properly!\"\n\n#b Historically#! women's suffrage in Switzerland took a very long time. It was not until 1971 that it was introduced for Swiss votes and elections. In some Cantons it took even longer. The two Appenzells took the longest. Appenzell Ausserrhoden adopted women's suffrage in 1989 at a Landsgemeinde. Appenzell Innerrhoden, on the other hand, had to be forced by the Federal Court to introduce women's suffrage in 1990.\nSwitzerland is thus one of the countries that introduced women's suffrage the latest. Countries that introduced women's suffrage earlier include Afghanistan, Finland, the USA and many others."
 dufour.1000.g: "Force them to let women vote."
 dufour.1000.h: "Surely they will soon decide to give women the vote."
 dufour_womens_suffrage_appenzell_effects_tt:0 "You do not force the two Cantons to introduce women's suffrage. You will receive an event if there is progress in the matter or if your decision is necessary."

#Defeat in the vote on women's suffrage in both Appenzell
 dufour.1001.t: "Defeat in the vote on women's suffrage in both Appenzell"
 dufour.1001.d: "The government in Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Appenzell Innerrhoden proposed legislation to introduce women's suffrage at the cantonal level. The bill was rejected. This means that the women of Appenzell are still not allowed to vote. We could force the two Appenzells to grant women their right, but that would certainly turn the local population against us."
 dufour.1001.f: "\"Raise your hand if you want to introduce women's suffrage at the Cantonal level!\" Many hands went up in the air. But were there enough? \"You have rejected the introduction of women's suffrage at the cantonal level!\"\n\n#b Historically#! women's suffrage in Switzerland took a very long time. It was not until 1971 that it was introduced for Swiss votes and elections. In some Cantons it took even longer. The two Appenzells took the longest.

Countries that introduced women's suffrage earlier include Afghanistan, Finland, the USA and many others."
 dufour.1001.g: "Now I've had enough! Just force them to introduce women's suffrage!"
 dufour.1001.h: "Let's just wait a little longer."

#Both Appenzell introduce women's suffrage
 dufour.1002.t: "Both Appenzell introduce women's suffrage"
 dufour.1002.d: "Who would have thought that? Both Appenzell introduced women's suffrage by a show of hands at their regional assemblies. This means that women can now vote everywhere in Switzerland."
 dufour.1002.f: "\"Raise your hand if you want to introduce women's suffrage at the Cantonal level!\" Many hands went up in the air. But were there enough? \"You have approved the introduction of women's suffrage at the Cantonal level!\" Cheers erupted!\n\n#b Historically#! women's suffrage in Switzerland took a very long time.

 dufour.1002.g: "It took them longer than I would have thought!"

#Further failure in the introduction of women's suffrage in the two Appenzell
 dufour.1003.t: "Further failure in the introduction of women's suffrage in the two Appenzell"
 dufour.1003.d: "It was already the second attempt of some progressive Appenzellers to introduce women's suffrage. But this attempt was also unsuccessful. We could still force the introduction or wait even longer and hope that the people of Appenzell introduce the women's suffrage voluntarily."
 dufour.1003.f: "\"Raise your hand if you want to introduce women's suffrage at the Cantonal level!\" Many hands went up in the air.

 dufour.1003.g: "Damn hillbillies. They had their chance, now we're forcing them!"
 dufour.1003.h: "We can't just undermine the democratic process."

#Federal Court forces Appenzell Innerrhoden to introduce women's suffrage
 dufour.1004.t: "Federal Court forces Appenzell Innerrhoden to introduce women's suffrage"
 dufour.1004.d: "After Appenzell Ausserrhoden accepted the women's suffrage at its last Landsgemeinde, the Federal Court has made a decision in the case of Appenzell Innerrhoden. Appenzell Innerrhoden must introduce women's suffrage. The matter has thus been decided once and for all."
 dufour.1004.f: "\"The Federal Court finds that Appenzell violates the constitution of the Swiss Confederation. Women have the same rights as men. Appenzell Innerrhoden is obliged to introduce women's suffrage immediately!\"\n\n#b Historically#! women's suffrage in Switzerland took a very long time. It was not until 1971 that it was introduced for Swiss votes and elections. In some Cantons it took even longer. The two Appenzells took the longest.

#First Eidgenössisches Schwing- und Älplerfest
 dufour.2000.t: "First Eidgenössisches Schwing- und Älplerfest in Biel"
 dufour.2000.d: "Many Schwinger participated in the first Eidgenössisches Schwing- und Älplerfest. The event was held in the town of Biel and was planned by the Swiss Schwing clubs after the sport became more and more popular. After the immense succes the participants and planners are looking forward to the next event in three years. And many Schwinger are eager to win the event and the first price - a strong bull."
 dufour.2000.f: "Two huge bodies are wrestling each other, neither one wants to fall. Both opponents go down under the cheers of the audience. Alfred Niklaus is on top. He is the first Schwingerkönig! But first he helps his opponent to get up and cleans his back from saw dust.\n\n#b Historically #! Schwingen - a form of wrestling with very strict rules - was a popular sport in Switzerland, although its origin can't be traced well. But the first local Schwingfest was held at the Unspunnenmatte in Interlaken. The first Eidgenössisches Schwing- und Älplerfest was held in 1895 in Biel and then regularly all two or three years. At the Schwing- und Älplerfest there are also the two other Swiss national sports Hornussen (a team sport featuring the hitting of a puck called \"Hornuss\") and Steinstossen (a form of stone put).\n\nThe Eidgenössisches Schwing- und Älplerfest is celebrated to this day. The most recent event occured in Pratteln close to Basel in 2022 and the next event will be held in Mollis in 2025. The winner is awarded with a bull, the Schwingerkönig of 2022 - Joel Wicki - won the bull \"Magnus\" a Red Holstein."
 dufour.2000.g: "I can't wait for the next event!"

 dufour.2001.t: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('dufour_schwingerkonig_scope').GetLastName] [SCOPE.sCharacter('dufour_schwingerkonig_scope').GetFirstName] has won the Eidgenössisches Schwingfest!"
 dufour.2001.d: "After a fierce fight, [SCOPE.sCharacter('dufour_schwingerkonig_scope').GetLastName] [SCOPE.sCharacter('dufour_schwingerkonig_scope').GetFirstName] has risen as the winner of this year's Eidgenössisches Schwingfest."
 swiss_flavor_events.21.f1: "Two huge bodies are wrestling each other, neither one wants to fall. Both opponents go down under the cheers of the audience. One man is on top, he won this \"Gang\". He helps his opponent to get up and cleans the other man's back from saw dust."
 swiss_flavor_events.21.f2: "\n\nInterestingly, in Schwingen the names of the Schwinger are switched around and start with the last name. If Abraham Lincoln would have been a Schwinger he would have been called Lincoln Abraham."
 swiss_flavor_events.21.f3: "\n\nIf an oponent has the same number of points as the Schwingerkönig he gets the title of \"Erstgekrönter\" which means first crowned."
 swiss_flavor_events.21.f4: "\n\nThe best 15 percent at an Eidgenössisches are awarded a wreath. They are usually called the \"Eidgenossen\"."
 swiss_flavor_events.21.f5: "\n\nOther participants get prices too. They are put in a temple of gifts. Each gift was donated by someone or by some organization."
 swiss_flavor_events.21.f6: "\n\nThree different Schwinger were Schwingerkönig for three times yet. Hans Stucki won in 1900, 1902 and 1905. Rudolf Hunsperger won in 1966, 1969 and 1974. Jörg Abderhalden won in 1998, 2004 and 2007"
 swiss_flavor_events.21.f7: "\n\nThere are other Schwingfeste in Switzerland. Two of the most important ones are the \"Unspunnen-Schwinget\" close to Interlaken and the \"Kilchberger Schwinget\" in the Canton of Zürich. If a Schwinger wins those two and the Eidgenössisches, it is called a \"Schwinger-Grand-Slam\"."
 swiss_flavor_events.21.f8: "\n\nIn Schwingen you do not just get points for winning. If two opponents have a tie but fought an attractive fight, they get rewarded 0.25 points more than if it were a boring fight. Even if you lose but fight bravely and good you get 0.75 points more."
 swiss_flavor_events.21.f9: "\n\nThe Schwingfeste with high prestige are the \"Bergschwingfeste\", that take place on mountains. They are folk festivals and there is traditional music as well. The most well known Bergschwingfeste are the \"Stoos-Schwinget\", the \"Rigi Schwing- und Älplerfest\", the \"Brünigschwinget\", the \"Schwarzsee-Schwinget\", the \"Weissenstein-Schwinget\" and the \"Schwägalp-Schwinget\"."
 dufour.2001.g: "Congratulations!"
