In its purest form, classicism is an aesthetic attitude dependent on principles based in the culture, art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome, with the emphasis on form, simplicity, proportion, clarity of structure, perfection, restrained emotion, as well as explicit appeal to the intellect."

Irrationalists declare that human reason alone is incapable of recognizing the foundations, connections and laws of objective reality. As alternatives for descriptive and normative explanations of the world, higher cognitive functions such as, for example, intuition, faith, intuition or direct experience are suggested."

 elgar.9.t: "Twelve-tone technique"
 elgar.9.d: "After decades of musical stagnation, modern composers have come up with a new concept that will revolutionize the world of music."
 elgar.9.f: "The twelve-tone technique - also known as dodecaphony, twelve-tone serialism, and (in British usage) twelve-note composition - is a method of musical composition. The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note  through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. All 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Over time, the technique increased greatly in popularity and eventually became widely influential on 20th-century composers. It is commonly considered a form of serialism."

 elgar.92.d: "With the plan to build a large opera house in Mexico City, the government is planning one of the largest construction projects in the country's history."
 elgar.92.f: "The theater was built between 1840 and 1844 by architect Lorenzo de la Hidalga in Mexico City. Historians consider it the most important architectural work in Mexico City between the completion of the Metropolitan Cathedral and the building of the Palacio de Bellas Artes. The Great National Theater was inaugurated in one of Antonio López de Santa Anna's terms as president. Its name changed successively, from Great Theater of Santa Anna to Great Theater Vergara, then Great Imperial Theatre, and finally Great National Theatre. During the opera season of 1852 the theater premiered 17 operas and offered more than 60 performances."
 elgar.93.t: "Teatro Amazonas"
 elgar.93.d: "Due to the boom that the region is experiencing through rubber cultivation, Manaus is to receive an opulent opera house - in the middle of the jungle!"
 elgar.93.f: "The Amazonas Theatre was built during the Belle Époque at a time when fortunes were made in the rubber boom. Construction of the Amazon Theatre was first proposed in 1881 by a member of the local House of Representatives, Antonio Jose Fernandes Júnior, who envisioned a 'jewel' in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. The theatre's architectural style is considered typically Renaissance Revival. The roofing tiles were imported from Alsace, the steel walls from Glasgow, Scotland and the Carrara marble for the stairs, statues and columns, from Italy. The dome is covered with 36,000 decorated ceramic tiles painted in the colors of the national flag of Brazil. The interior furnishing came from France in the Louis Quinze style. Italian artist Domenico de Angelis the Younger painted the panels that decorate the ceilings of the auditorium and of the audience chamber."
  
 elgar.101.t: "A Monument for Beethoven"
 elgar.101.d: "Following a call from the composer Robert Schumann, several intellectuals, but also citizens, patriots and those interested in art spoke out in favor of erecting a memorial to Ludwig van Beethoven in Bonn."
 elgar.101.f: "'The mausoleum of future memory is already in front of me in person - a reasonably high cuboid, a lyre on it with the year of birth and death, the sky above and a few trees next to it. A whole nation faced with a Beethoven who teaches them greatness and pride in every page, shouldn't they be able to set up a monument thousand times greater one for him? If I were a prince, I would build him a temple in the Palladian style! Form him in a gigantic form, like Saint Borromeo on Lago Maggiore, so that, as he did in life, he could look over mountain and mountains - and when the Rhine ships fly by and the strangers ask: What does the giant mean, then every child can answer: Beethoven is that - and they will think it is a German Emperor. In a word: get up, let go of your phlegm and consider that the monument will be your own!' - Robert Schumann"
 elgar.101.g: "Beethoven was a german titan of music!"
 elgar.101.h: "We are happy to finance this culturally valuable project."
 elgar.101.i: "He can't have been that great if he didn't have a monument before."
 elgar.102.t: "Preparing the Beethoven Festival"
 elgar.102.d: "The finishing touches on the Beethoven monument are done. Now it's time to prepare for the inauguration."
 elgar.102.f: "The Beethoven Festival for the inauguration of the Beethoven monument was a major musical event of international standing. In addition to the Prussian king, the British Queen Victoria was also invited, intellectual greats such as Alexander von Humboldt were among the guests, and composers of the rank of Hector Berlioz, Giacomo Meyerbeer and above all Franz Liszt shaped the four days. Thousands of people were supposed to take part in the festival, which posed serious problems for the small town of Bonn."
 elgar.102.g: "Send the invitations!"
 elgar.103.t: "Invitation for the Beethoven Festival"
 elgar.103.d: "Our government has received an official invitation to the Beethoven Festival in Bonn, where the composer's monument is to be unveiled."
 elgar.103.g: "We'll gladly attend."
 elgar.103.h: "Classical music is overrated."
 elgar.104.t: "Build the Beethoven Hall"
 elgar.104.d: "Due to the high number of visitors, Franz Liszt proposed diverting men and material from the Cologne Cathedral construction site to Bonn in order to build a festival hall in record time."
 elgar.104.f: "The official unveiling of the Beethoven Monument was to be the high point of a 3-day Beethoven Festival. A month before the festival was due to commence, there was not a suitable venue to hold the expected 3,000 attendees. At Liszt's urgings, and only after he offered to bear the full cost himself, the committee engaged an architect and builders to construct the Beethoven Hall. By the time they finally started, they had less than two weeks to do this, and had to work around the clock to finish it on time. Franz Liszt also spoke to the builders of Cologne Cathedral. Lumber was loaded from Cologne to Bonn via the Rhine. Decorations made in Cologne also came to Bonn so quickly. In just eleven days, a festival hall was created out of nowhere."
 elgar.104.g: "Splendid."
 elgar.105.t: "The Beethoven Festival"
 elgar.105.d: "After four days of top-class music, the Beethoven Festival can be considered a complete success, even if events of this magnitude cannot do without their scandals."
 elgar.105.f: "The ceremony was not without its awkward moments. The Beethoven monument turned its back on the most important guests, King Frederick William IV of Prussia and the British Queen Victoria, who had taken their places on the balcony of the Fürstenberg Palace. Alexander von Humboldt saved the day by remarking that Beethoven had always been a rude fellow. Even more embarrassing was the fact that, during the toasts at the festival banquet in the 'Goldene Stern', Liszt snubbed the French contingent led by Berlioz and nearly caused a riot. The banquet was disrupted by the behaviour of Lola Montez, who danced on a table and embarrassed Liszt by insisting she was his guest at the celebrations and demanding a seat appropriate to her claimed status, thus upsetting a pre-organised seating arrangement."
 elgar.105.g: "Beethoven turns his back to us?"
 elgar.105.h: "Alexander von Humboldt is a gentleman."
 elgar.105.i: "These Germans have no elegance."
 elgar.105.j: "This was inspiring."
 elgar.106.t: "Liszt cantata"
 elgar.106.d: "Franz Liszt had the great honor of writing and publicly performing the cantata for the inauguration of the Beethoven monument."
 elgar.106.f: "'Be that as it may, his cantata, truly well performed and warmly applauded by three quarters and a half of the hall, is a great and beautiful thing, which at once elevates Liszt very highly among composers. The expression in it is true, the intonation right, the style sublime and new, the form well conceived and dutifully executed, the instrumentation remarkable for its vigor and variety. There is never a succession of the same sounds in his orchestra, which makes certain works, once prized, so tiresome for the listener; he knows how to use the small and large means, he demands neither the instruments nor the voices too much; in a word, he showed in one fell swoop that he had style in instrumentation and in the other parts of the musical art, since one feared he hadn't found it yet.' - Hector Berlioz"
 elgar.106.g: "Hail! Hail! Beethoven, hail!"
 elgar.107.t: "Berlioz at the Beethoven Festival"
 elgar.107.d: "The celebrations surrounding the unveiling of the Beethoven Monument have given composer Hector Belrioz considerable inspiration."
 elgar.107.f: "'It was during this trip to Austria, Hungary, Bohemia and Silesia that I started composing my legend of Faust, the plan of which I had been pondering for a long time. As soon as I resolved to undertake it, I had to settle for writing myself most of the libretto as well; the fragments of the French translation of Goethe’s Faust by Gérard de Nerval, which I had already set to music twenty years before, and which I intended to include in the new score in a revised version, and two or three other scenes which had been written before my departure from Paris by M. Gandonnière following my instructions, did not add up to one-sixth of the entire work. During the journey in the old German stage-coach, I therefore tried to write the verses intended for my music. I started with Faust’s invocation to nature, without attempting to translate or even imitate Goethe’s masterpiece, but only to draw inspiration from it and to extract the musical substance that it contained. Once I had started I wrote the remaining verses as the musical ideas came to me, and I composed the score with an ease that I have rarely experienced with my other works.' - Hector Berlioz"
 elgar.107.g: "So was the trip worth it?"
 elgar.108.t: "Victoria visits Cologne Cathedral"
 elgar.108.d: "Britain's Queen Victoria used her stay in the Rhineland as an opportunity to visit Cologne Cathedral and find out more about the cathedral construction that has just started."
 elgar.108.f: "The early departure of the royal company from the concert was due to the fact that in the afternoon there was a tour of the Cologne Cathedral, which took place to the festive ringing of the bells. The Majesties then proceeded through the main entrance of the central nave to the choir, in which a celebratory cantata was being performed by the Cologne men's choral society with the organ accompaniment of the music director Weber."
 elgar.108.g: "We are honored."
  
 elgar.111.t: "A Monument for Mozart"
 elgar.111.d: "Preparations for erecting a monument to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart are in full swing. However, donations are still being collected."
 elgar.111.f: "In 1835, the writer Julius Schilling, who came from Posen in what is now Poland, suggested a memorial on what is now Mozartplatz for Mozart, who was relatively unknown in Salzburg at the time. Significant sponsors abroad but also in Vienna finally supported the construction of the monument. The Bavarian King Ludwig I of Bavaria donated a considerable sum and donated the base of the bronze statue."
 elgar.111.g: "Mozart was a german titan of music!"

 elgar.113.d: "Today the memorial for Slazburg's greatest son was unveiled in his birthplace."
 elgar.113.f: "Designed by Ludwig Schwanthaler and cast by Johann Baptist Stiglmaier, the monument was ceremonially unveiled on September 5, 1842 in the presence of both of Mozart's surviving sons, Franz Xaver and Carl Thomas. However, Mozart's widow was not able to see the inauguration. She had died shortly before in the house at Mozartplatz 8. A festival with a torchlight procession, boat trips, Alpine trains, target shooting and horse races framed the celebration."
 elgar.114.t: "A living Memorial"
 elgar.114.d: "Efforts to erect a monument to Mozart are increasing in Austria. Some citizens of Frankfurt therefore want to organize a benefit concert - and link the idea with political content."
 elgar.114.f: "Originally, the Frankfurt citizenship wanted to organize a concert to collect enough donations for a Mozart monument. Monuments to bourgeois personalities were a novelty in Germany. The erection of monuments in honor of national figures such as artists or scientists was therefore a welcome opportunity to express patriotic feelings. Some in Frankfurt even suggest organizing a national singers' meeting, the proceeds of which should flow into a foundation for German musicians to promote young musicians."

 elgar.116.d: "42 choral societies from the Rhineland, Baden, Hessen, and Franconia met in Frankfurt to celebrate a three-day festival of Mozart's music. The event turned into a demonstration for the political unification of Germany, however. The money raised was raised for a foundation to support young composers."
 elgar.116.f: "'The city went into raptures. The houses were filled with people up to the skylights. The people of Mainz, Hanau, and Offenbach came by boat to the sound of cannon shots, surrounded by decorated boats with music; through all the gates they entered. It was a powerfully moving sight, the artistic interest became secondary, but the national approached us powerfully; I won't deny that bright tears ran down my cheeks.' - Heinrich Hoffmann"

 elgar.117.f: "42 choral societies from the Rhineland, Baden, Hessen, and Franconia met in Frankfurt to celebrate a three-day festival of Mozart's music. The event turned into a demonstration for the political unification of Germany, however. The event was originally based on financing the Mozart monument, but the initiators soon changed the purpose of the charity in favor of their own foundation."

 elgar.121.d: "Today the Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein (General German Music Association) was founded in [SCOPE.sState('elgar_musikverein_capital').GetCityHubName]. A discussion immediately arose about whether we belong to the New German School or whether we defend the conservative idea of music."
 elgar.121.f: "The New German School is a term introduced in 1859 by Franz Brendel, editor of the Neue Zeitung für Musik, to describe certain trends in German music. It has been used by different persons at different times with different meanings. It is generally agreed that Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner were among the most prominent representatives of the 'New German School'. There is also a consensus that Johannes Brahms did not take part. Beyond this, interpretations differ. The new term should be understood as denoting the whole period since Beethoven's death. According to Brendel, it was common usage to call the period of J.S. Bach and Handel 'Old German School'. The subsequent period was that of Viennese masters such as Mozart who had been influenced by the Italian style. Beethoven had redirected interest to the German North again and with this had opened the 'Neudeutsche Schule'. Composers from both sides looked back on Beethoven as their spiritual and artistic hero; the conservatives seeing him as an unsurpassable peak, the progressives as a new beginning in music."

 elgar.123.d: "The members of the General German Music Association have chosen [SCOPE.sState('elgar_musikverein_capital').GetCityHubName] as the location for the next meeting of the Tonkünstler-Versammlung (Musician's Congress)."
 elgar.123.f: "In 1859 the first Tonkünstler meeting took place on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the New Magazine for Music in Leipzig. During the second Tonkunstler meeting (1861) in Weimar, the statutes of the General German Music Association (ADMV) were adopted by over 700 founding members. The New Magazine for Music became the organ of the association. At the end of the 19th century, the ADMV was under the protectorate of the Grand Duke of Weimar. The ADMV has held a number of large Tonkunstler gatherings. It mostly oriented itself to the direction of the New German School represented by Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. As part of the artistic aims of the ADMV, annual Tonkünstler meetings at different locations were to be arranged, with performances of important, rarely heard, and especially new musical works of all kinds. However, older works that were only seldom or not at all heard, but of interest because of their importance, were also to be performed. In addition, new works, either musical or scholarly ones, were to be printed."

 elgar.125.f: "The 'War of the Romantics' is a term used by some music historians to describe the schism among prominent musicians in the second half of the 19th century. Musical structure, the limits of chromatic harmony, and program music versus absolute music were the principal areas of contention. The opposing parties crystallized during the 1850s. The most prominent members of the conservative circle were Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim, Clara Schumann, and the Leipzig Conservatoire, which had been founded by Felix Mendelssohn. Their opponents, the radical progressives mainly from Weimar, were represented by Franz Liszt and the members of the so-called New German School (German: Neudeutsche Schule), and by Richard Wagner. The controversy was German and Central European in origin; musicians from France, Italy, and Russia were only marginally involved. Composers from both sides looked back on Beethoven as their spiritual and artistic hero; the conservatives seeing him as an unsurpassable peak, the progressives as a new beginning in music. "

 elgar.126.f_konservativ: "A central point of disagreement between these two groups of musicians was between traditional and new musical forms. This was an outgrowth of the debate on the viability of the symphony genre, which had grown in the hands of Ludwig van Beethoven from one intended for entertainment to a form that included social, moral and cultural ideals. Liszt and his circle favored new styles in writing and forms that would blend music with narrative and pictorial ideas. Toward this end Liszt developed the symphonic poem. The Leipzig/Berlin school championed the forms used by the classic masters, forms codified by musicologists such as Adolf Bernhard Marx of the early 19th century. The validity of program music was also a point of contention. In his 1854 book, Vom Musikalisch-Schönen, Hanslick stated that music did not and could not represent anything specific other than itself. \n\n In the end, #G [GetGlobalVariable('elgar_neudeutsch_yes').GetValue]#!

 elgar.302.d: "Unfortunately, the orchestra rehearsals conducted by a traveling composer were not as good as the concert hall had hoped..."

 elgar.302.g: "Not fine."
 elgar.303.t: "An amorous dedication"
 elgar.303.d: "An affair for a 'little' courtesy stirs tempers."
 elgar.303.f: "Artists have always been known for their somewhat 'loose lifestyle' and caused one or two interpersonal scandals. Attention rests on a small gesture, which, however, has explosive power. A traveling composer dedicated a sonata to a married lady and gave her the original score as a gift. However, the woman is the wife of a highly respected general in our army. The gift has sparked speculation and could damage the man's public image. The military demands action."
 elgar.303.g: "I do not see the problem?"
 elgar.303.h: "Outrageous!"
 elgar.304.t: "An evening reception"
 elgar.304.d: "Our monarch has invited a traveling composer to a princely reception. The composer showed his gratitude with a composition."
 elgar.304.f: "Although musical culture in the 19th century increasingly sought to free itself from patronage, nobles and kings were still at the forefront of patronage of the arts, and many musical works were still dedicated to princes and kings. On the other hand, the personal relationship often meant that composers who were excluded from academies and art circles were able to find support from a wealthy patron if they suited his personal taste. A whole series of Wagner's masterpieces, for example, would not have been possible without the personal support of King Ludwig II of Bavaria."
 elgar.304.g: "What a beautiful surprise!"
 elgar.305.t: "Sold out!"
 elgar.305.d: "A row over a sold-out performance by a great composer has sparked a public outcry!"
 elgar.305.f: "On the day of a premiere, a large crowd had gathered expectantly in front of the opera house, which had been sold out for days; even the composer who appeared could only get a ticket on the black market. However, since a theater employee had sold additional tickets himself, the tickets sold far exceeded the number of seats. There were tumultuous scenes in and in front of the theater in which the music was almost completely lost; those outside yelled to be let in, those inside cried out for quiet. The opening choruses could still be performed, but then the orchestra gave up, which was when the racket really started."
 elgar.305.g: "Who is responsible for that?!"
 elgar.306.t: "Sursprising premiere"
 elgar.306.d: "The work of a composer who failed in his home country has captured the hearts of our audience."
 elgar.306.f: "There have always been cases in which the premiere of famous works failed. Such experiences often led not only to serious self-doubt and the end of a career, but also to an attempt to perform the same play for a different audience. Later classics often only prevailed on the second or third attempt. Not the place of the premiere, but the place of success was then remembered as the actual initial spark. Hector Berlioz is an example of a composer who enjoyed greater success with his works in Britain and Germany than at home in France."
 elgar.306.g: "Our audience is more grateful."
 elgar.307.t: "Musical friendship"
 elgar.307.d: "A traveling composer got along with his fellow musicians on site straight away."
 elgar.307.f: "The relationship between foreign and resident musicians was not always easy. It wasn't just national resentment and personal prejudice. Some orchestras could not work with the conducting style of a guest conductor, sometimes the short-term nature of performances required compromises, for which the guest in turn blamed the local music world. Many a local composer or conductor also feared the influence of foreigners would be too great. However, despite all these obstacles, friendships continued to grow."
 elgar.307.g: "A fruitful freindship."
 elgar.308.t: "Musical rivalry"
 elgar.308.d: "The local music world views the appearance of a traveling composer with resentment and suspicion."
 elgar.308.f: "'Two great works for the Opera, two more for the Renaissance, two more for the Opera-Comique, and yet another for the Theatre Italien? It seems that Monsieur Donizetti treats us like a conquered country, it's a real invasion. One can no longer speak of the opera houses of Paris, but only of the opera houses of Monsieur Donizetti.' - Hector Berlioz"
 elgar.308.g: "These musicians should pull themselves together!"
 elgar.309.t: "Inspirations"
 elgar.309.d: "A foreign composer has inspired the members of the state orchestra."
 elgar.309.f: "Outside influence has often made a difference in the local and national music world. Unfamiliar pieces, a foreign musical language or the appearance of a charismatic musician could often lead to the local musicians gaining a completely new perspective."
 elgar.309.g: "Inspiration? I want to see results!"
 elgar.309.h: "This will have a positive effect on the orchestra."
 elgar.310.t: "Mania"
 elgar.310.d: "The appearance of a composer has led to an unprecedented, almost hysterical public enthusiasm for his work. People have nothing else in mind!"
 elgar.310.f: "'When formerly I heard of the fainting spells which broke out in Germany and specially in Berlin, when Liszt showed himself there, I shrugged my shoulders pityingly and thought: quiet sabbatarian Germany does not wish to lose the opportunity of getting the little necessary exercise permitted it... In their case, thought I, it is a matter of the spectacle for the spectacle's sake...Thus I explained this Lisztomania, and looked on it as a sign of the politically unfree conditions existing beyond the Rhine. Yet I was mistaken, after all, and I did not notice it until last week, at the Italian Opera House, where Liszt gave his first concert...This was truly no Germanically sentimental, sentimentalizing Berlinate audience, before which Liszt played, quite alone, or rather, accompanied solely by his genius. And yet, how convulsively his mere appearance affected them! How boisterous was the applause which rang to meet him!... What acclaim it was! A veritable insanity, one unheard of in the annals of furore!' - Heinrich Heine"

 elgar.311.t: "Music brings people together"
 elgar.311.d: "An ambassador asks if we can get him a ticket to a concert by a composer who is staying with us."
 elgar.311.f: "The ambassador of a great power is a lover of a traveling composer who is currently visiting our country. He would like to attend a performance, but there are no more seats available. He has therefore asked us to use our political influence so that he can still attend the performance."
 elgar.311.g: "Haha. No."

A sneaky assassin took advantage of a popular composer's concert to shoot a high-ranking government official during the performance.

 elgar.313.t: "A minor work"
 elgar.313.d: "A small work composed by the great composer in our country may not be a big hit, but it has found its fans."
 elgar.313.f: "Occasional works by composers that were created apart from the famous works did not have to be of average quality at the same time. Time and time again, small pieces have managed to attract more attention than many a life's work. Despite his wealth of work, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov is famous in pop culture for The 'Flight of the Bumblebee' (from Tsar Saltan) and Edvard Grieg for 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' (from Peer Gynt) - wrongly so, but a music hit is a music hit."

 elgar.315.t: "Private Concert"
 elgar.315.d: "Apart from the official performances, our composer gave a private concert in a small circle."
 elgar.315.f: "Small private concerts by great composers have a long tradition. Most famous for this is Franz Schubert with the Schubertiades named after him. At the first Schubertiades Franz Schubert played the piano, and the baritones Johann Michael Vogl and later Carl von Schönstein sang his songs. The evenings also included readings and witty entertainment games, which often had a specific theme. These were a mixture of friendly meetings and literary-musical salon."

 elgar.316.d: "The great composer in our country has discovered the talent of one of our country's political leaders and has considered instructing him in his art of composition."
 elgar.316.f: "One might be surprised that politicians are capable of artistic talent at all, and that, as bad people, they shouldn't in principle be completely insensitive to any musical art. There were certainly composers with political ambitions, but far fewer politicians with musical ambitions. Whatever might be possessed by this politician, perhaps his soul is not irretrievably lost after all."

 elgar.317.t: "Musical desaster"
 elgar.317.d: "A performance in one of our concert halls could go down as one of the biggest failures in our music history."
 elgar.317.f: "The orchestra was unprepared, the soloist caught a cold, the conductor wasn't rested and the composer, in whose presence the performance took place, is threatening to cancel our country from his next tour. There's no other way to describe it than a disaster!"
 elgar.317.g: "An international disgrace!"
 elgar.318.t: "Scandal concert"
 elgar.318.d: "A scandalous concert, which simply got the audience up in arms with its 'modern' sounds, not only splits society, but also has legal consequences."
 elgar.318.f: "Press reports at the time speak of tumultuous riots. The composer's followers, his students and opponents shouted at each other, threw at each other, disrupted the performance, destroyed the furniture, etc. Several times, outraged conservatives from the audience climbed the stage cursing to slap the conductor. When he threatened that order would be created with the help of public authority, the tumult is said to have really started. Then there was a slap in the face. In the subsequent judicial sequel, an operetta composer who was present stated: the clapping of the slaps 'was the most melodious thing one could hear that evening'."
 elgar.318.g: "The rabble has no sense of culture. That was excellent!"
 elgar.318.h: "Remove the piece from the board immediately."

 elgar.320.t: "Musical Propaganda"
 elgar.320.d: "Some government politicians are considering whether the music of the composer who is currently staying with us could be ... borrowed for propaganda purposes."
 elgar.320.f: "Especially from the beginning of the 20th century and the mass society that produced the totalitarian regimes of the time, the idea of making the masses docile through music prevailed. While some musicians resisted the dictatorship even in these times, there were others who put their work directly at the service of an ideology, or at least allowed their talent to be put at the service of a political direction."
 elgar.320.g: "Music should be free from politics."
 elgar.320.h: "Sometimes, music should serve politics."
 elgar.321.t: "Great composers among themselves"
 elgar.321.d: "Our musical guest met a great composer employed by our country. In hour-long conversations and walks, they exchanged musical thoughts and ideas."
