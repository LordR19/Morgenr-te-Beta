 elgar_classicism_tech: "Classicism"
 elgar_classicism_tech_desc: "Classicism, in the arts, refers generally to a high regard for a classical period, classical antiquity in the Western tradition, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate. In its purest form, classicism is an aesthetic attitude dependent on principles based in the culture, art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome, with the emphasis on form, simplicity, proportion, clarity of structure, perfection, restrained emotion, as well as explicit appeal to the intellect."
 elgar_irrationalism_tech: "Irrationalism"
 elgar_irrationalism_tech_desc: "Irrationalism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the early 19th century, emphasizing the non-rational dimension of human life. Irrationalists declare that human reason alone is incapable of recognizing the foundations, connections and laws of objective reality. As alternatives for descriptive and normative explanations of the world, higher cognitive functions such as, for example, intuition, faith, intuition or direct experience are suggested."

 elgar_art_nouveau_tech: "Art Nouveau"
 elgar_art_nouveau_tech_desc: "#R This technology is only available via Journal Entry!#!\n\n[concept_elgar_art_nouveau] is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts. The style is known by different names in different languages: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English. It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk ("total work of art") that would unify the arts."
 elgar_art_deco_tech: "Art Déco"
 elgar_art_deco_tech_desc: "Art Déco combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, it represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. Art Deco is one of the first truly international styles, but its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II."

 elgar_impressionism_tech_desc: "#R This technology is only available via Journal Entry!#!\n\n[concept_elgar_impressionism] is a style of art from the 19th century that is characterized by the atmospheric depiction of fleeting snapshots.

 elgar_neoclassicism_tech: "Neoclassicism"
 elgar_neoclassicism_tech_desc: "After the turn of the century there was a renewed enthusiasm for classical ideals: Neoclassicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. While architects were once again using Roman and Greek construction as models, composers were rediscovering Baroque music as a source of inspiration."
 elgar_expressionism_tech: "Expressionism"
 elgar_expressionism_tech_desc: "#R This technology is only available via Journal Entry!#!\n\n[concept_elgar_expressionism] is a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas."
 elgar_new_objectivity_tech: "New Objectivity"
 elgar_new_objectivity_tech_desc: "Although principally describing a tendency in German painting, the term took a life of its own and came to characterize the attitude of public life in Weimar Germany as well as the art, literature, music, and architecture created to adapt to it. Rather than some goal of philosophical objectivity, it was meant to imply a turn towards practical engagement with the world - an all-business attitude, understood by Germans as intrinsically American."

 elgar.9.f: "The twelve-tone technique - also known as dodecaphony, twelve-tone serialism, and (in British usage) twelve-note composition - is a method of musical composition. The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note  through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. All 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Over time, the technique increased greatly in popularity and eventually became widely influential on 20th-century composers. It is commonly considered a form of serialism."

The Great National Theater was inaugurated in one of Antonio López de Santa Anna's terms as president.

Construction of the Amazon Theatre was first proposed in 1881 by a member of the local House of Representatives, Antonio Jose Fernandes Júnior, who envisioned a 'jewel' in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. The theatre's architectural style is considered typically Renaissance Revival. The roofing tiles were imported from Alsace, the steel walls from Glasgow, Scotland and the Carrara marble for the stairs, statues and columns, from Italy. The dome is covered with 36,000 decorated ceramic tiles painted in the colors of the national flag of Brazil. The interior furnishing came from France in the Louis Quinze style.

 elgar.101.f: "'The mausoleum of future memory is already in front of me in person - a reasonably high cuboid, a lyre on it with the year of birth and death, the sky above and a few trees next to it. A whole nation faced with a Beethoven who teaches them greatness and pride in every page, shouldn't they be able to set up a monument thousand times greater one for him? If I were a prince, I would build him a temple in the Palladian style! Form him in a gigantic form, like Saint Borromeo on Lago Maggiore, so that, as he did in life, he could look over mountain and mountains - and when the Rhine ships fly by and the strangers ask: What does the giant mean, then every child can answer: Beethoven is that - and they will think it is a German Emperor. In a word: get up, let go of your phlegm and consider that the monument will be your own!' - Robert Schumann"
 elgar.101.g: "Beethoven was a german titan of music!"
 elgar.101.h: "We are happy to finance this culturally valuable project."
 elgar.101.i: "He can't have been that great if he didn't have a monument before."
 elgar.102.t: "Preparing the Beethoven Festival"
 elgar.102.d: "The finishing touches on the Beethoven monument are done. Now it's time to prepare for the inauguration."
 elgar.102.f: "The Beethoven Festival for the inauguration of the Beethoven monument was a major musical event of international standing. In addition to the Prussian king, the British Queen Victoria was also invited, intellectual greats such as Alexander von Humboldt were among the guests, and composers of the rank of Hector Berlioz, Giacomo Meyerbeer and above all Franz Liszt shaped the four days. Thousands of people were supposed to take part in the festival, which posed serious problems for the small town of Bonn."
 elgar.102.g: "Send the invitations!"
 elgar.103.t: "Invitation for the Beethoven Festival"
 elgar.103.d: "Our government has received an official invitation to the Beethoven Festival in Bonn, where the composer's monument is to be unveiled."
 elgar.103.g: "We'll gladly attend."
 elgar.103.h: "Classical music is overrated."
 elgar.104.t: "Build the Beethoven Hall"
 elgar.104.d: "Due to the high number of visitors, Franz Liszt proposed diverting men and material from the Cologne Cathedral construction site to Bonn in order to build a festival hall in record time."
 elgar.104.f: "The official unveiling of the Beethoven Monument was to be the high point of a 3-day Beethoven Festival. A month before the festival was due to commence, there was not a suitable venue to hold the expected 3,000 attendees. At Liszt's urgings, and only after he offered to bear the full cost himself, the committee engaged an architect and builders to construct the Beethoven Hall. By the time they finally started, they had less than two weeks to do this, and had to work around the clock to finish it on time. Franz Liszt also spoke to the builders of Cologne Cathedral. Lumber was loaded from Cologne to Bonn via the Rhine. Decorations made in Cologne also came to Bonn so quickly. In just eleven days, a festival hall was created out of nowhere."
 elgar.104.g: "Splendid."
 elgar.105.t: "The Beethoven Festival"
 elgar.105.d: "After four days of top-class music, the Beethoven Festival can be considered a complete success, even if events of this magnitude cannot do without their scandals."
 elgar.105.f: "The ceremony was not without its awkward moments. The Beethoven monument turned its back on the most important guests, King Frederick William IV of Prussia and the British Queen Victoria, who had taken their places on the balcony of the Fürstenberg Palace. Alexander von Humboldt saved the day by remarking that Beethoven had always been a rude fellow. Even more embarrassing was the fact that, during the toasts at the festival banquet in the 'Goldene Stern', Liszt snubbed the French contingent led by Berlioz and nearly caused a riot. The banquet was disrupted by the behaviour of Lola Montez, who danced on a table and embarrassed Liszt by insisting she was his guest at the celebrations and demanding a seat appropriate to her claimed status, thus upsetting a pre-organised seating arrangement."
 elgar.105.g: "Beethoven turns his back to us?"
 elgar.105.h: "Alexander von Humboldt is a gentleman."
 elgar.105.i: "These Germans have no elegance."
 elgar.105.j: "This was inspiring."
 elgar.106.t: "Liszt cantata"
 elgar.106.d: "Franz Liszt had the great honor of writing and publicly performing the cantata for the inauguration of the Beethoven monument."
 elgar.106.f: "'Be that as it may, his cantata, truly well performed and warmly applauded by three quarters and a half of the hall, is a great and beautiful thing, which at once elevates Liszt very highly among composers. The expression in it is true, the intonation right, the style sublime and new, the form well conceived and dutifully executed, the instrumentation remarkable for its vigor and variety. There is never a succession of the same sounds in his orchestra, which makes certain works, once prized, so tiresome for the listener; he knows how to use the small and large means, he demands neither the instruments nor the voices too much; in a word, he showed in one fell swoop that he had style in instrumentation and in the other parts of the musical art, since one feared he hadn't found it yet.' - Hector Berlioz"
 elgar.106.g: "Hail! Hail! Beethoven, hail!"
 elgar.107.t: "Berlioz at the Beethoven Festival"
 elgar.107.d: "The celebrations surrounding the unveiling of the Beethoven Monument have given composer Hector Belrioz considerable inspiration."
 elgar.107.f: "'It was during this trip to Austria, Hungary, Bohemia and Silesia that I started composing my legend of Faust, the plan of which I had been pondering for a long time. As soon as I resolved to undertake it, I had to settle for writing myself most of the libretto as well; the fragments of the French translation of Goethe’s Faust by Gérard de Nerval, which I had already set to music twenty years before, and which I intended to include in the new score in a revised version, and two or three other scenes which had been written before my departure from Paris by M. Gandonnière following my instructions, did not add up to one-sixth of the entire work. During the journey in the old German stage-coach, I therefore tried to write the verses intended for my music. I started with Faust’s invocation to nature, without attempting to translate or even imitate Goethe’s masterpiece, but only to draw inspiration from it and to extract the musical substance that it contained. Once I had started I wrote the remaining verses as the musical ideas came to me, and I composed the score with an ease that I have rarely experienced with my other works.' - Hector Berlioz"
 elgar.107.g: "So was the trip worth it?"
 elgar.108.t: "Victoria visits Cologne Cathedral"
 elgar.108.d: "Britain's Queen Victoria used her stay in the Rhineland as an opportunity to visit Cologne Cathedral and find out more about the cathedral construction that has just started."
 elgar.108.f: "The early departure of the royal company from the concert was due to the fact that in the afternoon there was a tour of the Cologne Cathedral, which took place to the festive ringing of the bells. The Majesties then proceeded through the main entrance of the central nave to the choir, in which a celebratory cantata was being performed by the Cologne men's choral society with the organ accompaniment of the music director Weber."
 elgar.108.g: "We are honored."
  
 elgar.111.t: "A Monument for Mozart"
 elgar.111.d: "Preparations for erecting a monument to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart are in full swing. However, donations are still being collected."
 elgar.111.f: "In 1835, the writer Julius Schilling, who came from Posen in what is now Poland, suggested a memorial on what is now Mozartplatz for Mozart, who was relatively unknown in Salzburg at the time. Significant sponsors abroad but also in Vienna finally supported the construction of the monument. The Bavarian King Ludwig I of Bavaria donated a considerable sum and donated the base of the bronze statue."
 elgar.111.g: "Mozart was a german titan of music!"
 elgar.113.t: "The Mozart Monument"
 elgar.113.d: "Today the memorial for Slazburg's greatest son was unveiled in his birthplace."
 elgar.113.f: "Designed by Ludwig Schwanthaler and cast by Johann Baptist Stiglmaier, the monument was ceremonially unveiled on September 5, 1842 in the presence of both of Mozart's surviving sons, Franz Xaver and Carl Thomas. However, Mozart's widow was not able to see the inauguration. She had died shortly before in the house at Mozartplatz 8. A festival with a torchlight procession, boat trips, Alpine trains, target shooting and horse races framed the celebration."
 elgar.114.t: "A living Memorial"
 elgar.114.d: "Efforts to erect a monument to Mozart are increasing in Austria. Some citizens of Frankfurt therefore want to organize a benefit concert - and link the idea with political content."
 elgar.114.f: "Originally, the Frankfurt citizenship wanted to organize a concert to collect enough donations for a Mozart monument. Monuments to bourgeois personalities were a novelty in Germany. The erection of monuments in honor of national figures such as artists or scientists was therefore a welcome opportunity to express patriotic feelings. Some in Frankfurt even suggest organizing a national singers' meeting, the proceeds of which should flow into a foundation for German musicians to promote young musicians."
 elgar.114.g: "Collect money for our own living memorial - a festival in honor of Mozart!"

 elgar.116.t: "The Mozart Festival"
 elgar.116.d: "42 choral societies from the Rhineland, Baden, Hessen, and Franconia met in Frankfurt to celebrate a three-day festival of Mozart's music. The event turned into a demonstration for the political unification of Germany, however. The money raised was raised for a foundation to support young composers."
 elgar.116.f: "'The city went into raptures. The houses were filled with people up to the skylights. The people of Mainz, Hanau, and Offenbach came by boat to the sound of cannon shots, surrounded by decorated boats with music; through all the gates they entered. It was a powerfully moving sight, the artistic interest became secondary, but the national approached us powerfully; I won't deny that bright tears ran down my cheeks.' - Heinrich Hoffmann"
 elgar.116.g: "Music brings the nation together."
 elgar.117.t: "Liberal troublemakers make noise in Frankfurt"
 elgar.117.d: "It has not escaped our notice that some Jacobin-minded 'patriots' have exploited a supposed Mozart Festival in Frankfurt for their political agitation."
 elgar.117.f: "42 choral societies from the Rhineland, Baden, Hessen, and Franconia met in Frankfurt to celebrate a three-day festival of Mozart's music. The event turned into a demonstration for the political unification of Germany, however. The event was originally based on financing the Mozart monument, but the initiators soon changed the purpose of the charity in favor of their own foundation."

A discussion immediately arose about whether we belong to the New German School or whether we defend the conservative idea of music."
 elgar.121.f: "The New German School is a term introduced in 1859 by Franz Brendel, editor of the Neue Zeitung für Musik, to describe certain trends in German music. It has been used by different persons at different times with different meanings. It is generally agreed that Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner were among the most prominent representatives of the 'New German School'. There is also a consensus that Johannes Brahms did not take part. Beyond this, interpretations differ. The new term should be understood as denoting the whole period since Beethoven's death. According to Brendel, it was common usage to call the period of J.S. Bach and Handel 'Old German School'. The subsequent period was that of Viennese masters such as Mozart who had been influenced by the Italian style. Beethoven had redirected interest to the German North again and with this had opened the 'Neudeutsche Schule'. Composers from both sides looked back on Beethoven as their spiritual and artistic hero; the conservatives seeing him as an unsurpassable peak, the progressives as a new beginning in music."

 elgar.123.f: "In 1859 the first Tonkünstler meeting took place on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the New Magazine for Music in Leipzig. During the second Tonkunstler meeting (1861) in Weimar, the statutes of the General German Music Association (ADMV) were adopted by over 700 founding members. The New Magazine for Music became the organ of the association. At the end of the 19th century, the ADMV was under the protectorate of the Grand Duke of Weimar. The ADMV has held a number of large Tonkunstler gatherings. It mostly oriented itself to the direction of the New German School represented by Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. As part of the artistic aims of the ADMV, annual Tonkünstler meetings at different locations were to be arranged, with performances of important, rarely heard, and especially new musical works of all kinds. However, older works that were only seldom or not at all heard, but of interest because of their importance, were also to be performed. In addition, new works, either musical or scholarly ones, were to be printed."

 elgar.125.f: "The 'War of the Romantics' is a term used by some music historians to describe the schism among prominent musicians in the second half of the 19th century. Musical structure, the limits of chromatic harmony, and program music versus absolute music were the principal areas of contention. The opposing parties crystallized during the 1850s. The most prominent members of the conservative circle were Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim, Clara Schumann, and the Leipzig Conservatoire, which had been founded by Felix Mendelssohn. Their opponents, the radical progressives mainly from Weimar, were represented by Franz Liszt and the members of the so-called New German School (German: Neudeutsche Schule), and by Richard Wagner. The controversy was German and Central European in origin; musicians from France, Italy, and Russia were only marginally involved. Composers from both sides looked back on Beethoven as their spiritual and artistic hero; the conservatives seeing him as an unsurpassable peak, the progressives as a new beginning in music. "

 elgar.126.f_konservativ: "A central point of disagreement between these two groups of musicians was between traditional and new musical forms. This was an outgrowth of the debate on the viability of the symphony genre, which had grown in the hands of Ludwig van Beethoven from one intended for entertainment to a form that included social, moral and cultural ideals. Liszt and his circle favored new styles in writing and forms that would blend music with narrative and pictorial ideas. Toward this end Liszt developed the symphonic poem. The Leipzig/Berlin school championed the forms used by the classic masters, forms codified by musicologists such as Adolf Bernhard Marx of the early 19th century. The validity of program music was also a point of contention. In his 1854 book, Vom Musikalisch-Schönen, Hanslick stated that music did not and could not represent anything specific other than itself. \n\n In the end, #G [GetGlobalVariable('elgar_neudeutsch_yes').GetValue]#!

 elgar.303.f: "Artists have always been known for their somewhat 'loose lifestyle' and caused one or two interpersonal scandals. Attention rests on a small gesture, which, however, has explosive power. A traveling composer dedicated a sonata to a married lady and gave her the original score as a gift. However, the woman is the wife of a highly respected general in our army. The gift has sparked speculation and could damage the man's public image. The military demands action."

 elgar.304.d: "Our monarch has invited a traveling composer to a princely reception. The composer showed his gratitude with a composition."
 elgar.304.f: "Although musical culture in the 19th century increasingly sought to free itself from patronage, nobles and kings were still at the forefront of patronage of the arts, and many musical works were still dedicated to princes and kings. On the other hand, the personal relationship often meant that composers who were excluded from academies and art circles were able to find support from a wealthy patron if they suited his personal taste. A whole series of Wagner's masterpieces, for example, would not have been possible without the personal support of King Ludwig II of Bavaria."
 elgar.304.g: "What a beautiful surprise!"
 elgar.305.t: "Sold out!"
 elgar.305.d: "A row over a sold-out performance by a great composer has sparked a public outcry!"
 elgar.305.f: "On the day of a premiere, a large crowd had gathered expectantly in front of the opera house, which had been sold out for days; even the composer who appeared could only get a ticket on the black market. However, since a theater employee had sold additional tickets himself, the tickets sold far exceeded the number of seats. There were tumultuous scenes in and in front of the theater in which the music was almost completely lost; those outside yelled to be let in, those inside cried out for quiet. The opening choruses could still be performed, but then the orchestra gave up, which was when the racket really started."
 elgar.305.g: "Who is responsible for that?!"
 elgar.306.t: "Sursprising premiere"
 elgar.306.d: "The work of a composer who failed in his home country has captured the hearts of our audience."
 elgar.306.f: "There have always been cases in which the premiere of famous works failed. Such experiences often led not only to serious self-doubt and the end of a career, but also to an attempt to perform the same play for a different audience. Later classics often only prevailed on the second or third attempt. Not the place of the premiere, but the place of success was then remembered as the actual initial spark. Hector Berlioz is an example of a composer who enjoyed greater success with his works in Britain and Germany than at home in France."
 elgar.306.g: "Our audience is more grateful."
 elgar.307.t: "Musical friendship"
 elgar.307.d: "A traveling composer got along with his fellow musicians on site straight away."
 elgar.307.f: "The relationship between foreign and resident musicians was not always easy. It wasn't just national resentment and personal prejudice. Some orchestras could not work with the conducting style of a guest conductor, sometimes the short-term nature of performances required compromises, for which the guest in turn blamed the local music world. Many a local composer or conductor also feared the influence of foreigners would be too great. However, despite all these obstacles, friendships continued to grow."
 elgar.307.g: "A fruitful freindship."
 elgar.308.t: "Musical rivalry"
 elgar.308.d: "The local music world views the appearance of a traveling composer with resentment and suspicion."
 elgar.308.f: "'Two great works for the Opera, two more for the Renaissance, two more for the Opera-Comique, and yet another for the Theatre Italien? It seems that Monsieur Donizetti treats us like a conquered country, it's a real invasion. One can no longer speak of the opera houses of Paris, but only of the opera houses of Monsieur Donizetti.' - Hector Berlioz"

 elgar.309.h: "This will have a positive effect on the orchestra."

 elgar.310.f: "'When formerly I heard of the fainting spells which broke out in Germany and specially in Berlin, when Liszt showed himself there, I shrugged my shoulders pityingly and thought: quiet sabbatarian Germany does not wish to lose the opportunity of getting the little necessary exercise permitted it... In their case, thought I, it is a matter of the spectacle for the spectacle's sake...Thus I explained this Lisztomania, and looked on it as a sign of the politically unfree conditions existing beyond the Rhine. Yet I was mistaken, after all, and I did not notice it until last week, at the Italian Opera House, where Liszt gave his first concert...This was truly no Germanically sentimental, sentimentalizing Berlinate audience, before which Liszt played, quite alone, or rather, accompanied solely by his genius. And yet, how convulsively his mere appearance affected them! How boisterous was the applause which rang to meet him!... What acclaim it was! A veritable insanity, one unheard of in the annals of furore!' - Heinrich Heine"

Time and time again, small pieces have managed to attract more attention than many a life's work. Despite his wealth of work, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov is famous in pop culture for The 'Flight of the Bumblebee' (from Tsar Saltan) and Edvard Grieg for 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' (from Peer Gynt) - wrongly so, but a music hit is a music hit."

 elgar.315.f: "Small private concerts by great composers have a long tradition. Most famous for this is Franz Schubert with the Schubertiades named after him. At the first Schubertiades Franz Schubert played the piano, and the baritones Johann Michael Vogl and later Carl von Schönstein sang his songs. The evenings also included readings and witty entertainment games, which often had a specific theme. These were a mixture of friendly meetings and literary-musical salon."

The composer's followers, his students and opponents shouted at each other, threw at each other, disrupted the performance, destroyed the furniture, etc. Several times, outraged conservatives from the audience climbed the stage cursing to slap the conductor. When he threatened that order would be created with the help of public authority, the tumult is said to have really started. Then there was a slap in the face. In the subsequent judicial sequel, an operetta composer who was present stated: the clapping of the slaps 'was the most melodious thing one could hear that evening'."

While some musicians resisted the dictatorship even in these times, there were others who put their work directly at the service of an ideology, or at least allowed their talent to be put at the service of a political direction."
 elgar.320.g: "Music should be free from politics."

 elgar.423.d: "On a walk in nature, [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] found some inspiration that advanced his work."
 elgar.423.f: "Nature has already inspired many composers. Beethoven withdrew to the countryside and collected impressions there that later inspired him to write the 6th symphony. Gustav Mahler even set up his own little composer's cottage."
 elgar.423.g: "In the footsteps of Beethoven."
 elgar.424.t: "Disturbances"
 elgar.424.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] has been trying to compose for some time, but due to his political commitments, he keeps getting interrupted by a certain person."
 elgar.424.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] is not just a composer. In addition to his obligation as chief conductor, he also fulfills his other duties, which are currently suffering even more than usual. In addition, there are some extremely intrusive figures in his life right now. Of course: [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] could only use this denigration to publicly discredit an unwelcome party. On the other hand, his work is likely to be delayed even further if he is not sufficiently sealed off from disturbing influences."
 elgar.424.g: "Don't disturb him!"

 elgar.425.g: "Give him comfort"
 elgar.426.t: "Sea Shanty"
 elgar.426.f: "The original practical purpose of the shanty as a work song has always been paramount among seafarers. Linguistic and musical aspects, on the other hand, hardly played a role. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, faster ships were needed. The big-bellied East Indiamen disappeared and were replaced by clippers and frigates. This ultimately led to the shanties gradually losing their practical use for seafaring and being sung only for leisure and entertainment. Musicians collected old sea shanties or were inspired by them to create their own works."
 elgar.426.g: "Yo Ho!"
 elgar.427.t: "March"
 elgar.427.f: "The march flourished especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries with its nationalistic and militaristic tendencies and its revolutions. An example of this is Gioachino Rossini, who not only regularly incorporated pompous marches into his operas, but also composed a number of pieces for individual princes: including a commissioned composition for the Turkish Sultan Abdülmecid I (Marcia per il Sultano), which is still regularly performed on the program of Italian military bands. Also exemplary for the tendencies of the 19th century is the production of the Strauss family in Vienna, who composed a march at every suitable opportunity to demonstrate patriotism or loyalty to the emperor, or to honor military figures."
 elgar.427.g: "New material for the army."
 elgar.428.t: "Kunstlied"
 elgar.428.d: "Based on the poem of a great poet, [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] has written a Kunstlied as a side work."
 elgar.428.f: "In Western classical music tradition, Lied is a term for setting poetry to classical music to create a piece of polyphonic music. The term is used for any kind of song in contemporary German, but among English and French speakers, lied is often used interchangeably with 'art song' to encompass works that the tradition has inspired in other languages as well. The poems that have been made into lieder often center on pastoral themes or themes of romantic love."
 elgar.428.g: "Couldn't it have been something else...?"
 elgar.429.t: "Piano Sonata"
 elgar.429.d: "Piano pieces are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. As finger exercise for his next major work, [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] wrote a sonata and performed it last night at a small evening party."
 elgar.429.f: "In the early 19th century, the sonata form was defined, from a combination of previous practice and the works of important Classical composers, particularly Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, but composers such as Clementi also. It is during this period that the differences between the three- and the four-movement layouts became a subject of commentary, with emphasis on the concerto being laid out in three movements, and the symphony in four. Among works expressly labeled sonata for the piano, there are the three of Frédéric Chopin, those of Felix Mendelssohn, the three of Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt's Sonata in B minor, and later the sonatas of Johannes Brahms and Sergei Rachmaninoff."
 elgar.429.g: "A classic"
 elgar.431.t: "Violin Concerto"
 elgar.431.d: "After several months of effort and artistic creativity, [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] premiered his Violin Concerto today with him at the podium."
 elgar.431.f: "A violin concerto is an instrumental concerto for violin as a solo instrument and orchestra. As a genre of instrumental music, the first works emerged from the concerto grosso at the beginning of the 18th century. It finds its full expression in the classical period. It is usually in three movements, with a slow movement in the middle."
 elgar.432.t: "Symphony"
 elgar.432.d: "A very special performance is taking place in the Philharmonie tonight: high society has gathered to attend the premiere of [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName]'s new symphony."
 elgar.432.f: "A symphony is a term for instrumental works of varying form and instrumentation over the centuries. The classic form of the symphony developed in the 18th century and maintained a dominant position in the field of orchestral music well into the 20th century. This is a work consisting of several (usually three or four, more rarely five) movements for orchestra without soloists. Since Ludwig van Beethoven's 9th symphony, vocal parts (soloists and/or choir) have also occasionally appeared, for example in Gustav Mahler, although the role of the orchestra remains dominant."

 elgar.442.g: "An excellent performance!"
 elgar.442.h: "Our musicians are clearly superior."
 elgar.443.t: "Successful conductor"
 elgar.443.d: "Our Chief Conductor has garnered fame and honor abroad, thereby increasing the prestige of our nation in the world."
 elgar.443.f: "'In Austria everyone becomes what they are not.' - Gustav Mahler"
 elgar.443.g: "Hope they don't poach him."
 elgar.444.t: "Unsuccessful conductor"
 elgar.444.d: "Our chief conductor didn't get the expected applause on his last tour stop."
 elgar.444.f: "'Life when one first arrives is a continual mortification as one's romantic illusions are successively shattered and the musical treasure-house of one's imagination crumbles before the hopelessness of the reality. Every day fresh experiences bring fresh disappointments.' - Hector Berlioz"
 elgar.444.g: "Disappointing."

 elgar.501.d: "In a climate of popular struggle for unification and independence of Italy the 20-year-old student and patriot Goffredo Mameli has written an inspiring song, calling it 'The Song of the Italians'. It has become quite popular in a short time."
 elgar.501.f: "Il Canto degli Italiani (The Song of the Italians) is best known among Italians as 'Inno di Mameli' (Mameli's Hymn), after the author of the lyrics, or 'Fratelli d'Italia' (Brothers of Italy), from its opening line. The text was set to music by another Michele Novaro. The hymn enjoyed widespread popularity throughout the period of the Risorgimento and in the following decades. It was also printed on leaflets in Genoa and published on the December 10: the demonstration was officially dedicated to the 101st anniversary of the expulsion of the Austrian powers from the city - in fact it was an excuse to protest against foreign occupations in Italy and induce Carlo Alberto to embrace the Italian cause of liberty. In this occasion the tricolor flag was shown and Mameli's hymn was publicly sung for the first time."

 elgar.503.d: "In response to France's renewed desire for expansion, which sees the Rhine as a natural border, the poet Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote a song that is widely popular as the 'Deutschlandlied'."
 elgar.503.f: "The Song of the Germans, also known as the Deutschlandlied, was written by August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben on Heligoland. The specific reason for Hoffmann to write the song were French territorial claims to the Rhineland during the Rhine Crisis. He rejected these claims with the song, as happened with other German Rhine songs of the time. He supplemented this with further ideas, especially that of German unity, which alone could provide the prerequisite for defending against enemy attacks of any size. The poet created his work expressly to the melody of the old imperial hymn 'God Save Franz, the Emperor' by Joseph Haydn (1797). The song only gained greater importance during the First World War. Its third verse has been the text of the German national anthem since 1952."
