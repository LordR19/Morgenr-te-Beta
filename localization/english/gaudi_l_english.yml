 je_gaudi_secession_1: "The First Art Nouveau Secession"
 je_gaudi_secession_1_reason: "The new art movement of Art Nouveau has attracted numerous artists. Under certain conditions, this can result in an established artistic movement that enjoys international renown and gives painting and architecture new impetus. Historically, one of the most important associations of this type was the Vienna Secession. The Vienna Secession, more precisely the Association of Austrian Artists, is an association of artists in Vienna from the fin de siècle period. Derived from this, the Viennese variant of Art Nouveau is also referred to as Secession style or Viennese Art Nouveau."
 je_gaudi_secession_2: "The Second Art Nouveau Secession"
 je_gaudi_secession_2_reason: "The new art movement of Art Nouveau has attracted numerous artists.

 je_gaudi_secession_3: "The Third Art Nouveau Secession"
 je_gaudi_secession_3_reason: "The new art movement of Art Nouveau has attracted numerous artists. Under certain conditions, this can result in an established artistic movement that enjoys international renown and gives painting and architecture new impetus. Historically, one of the most important associations of this type was the Vienna Secession.

Derived from this, the Viennese variant of Art Nouveau is also referred to as Secession style or Viennese Art Nouveau."
 je_gaudi_splendid_architecture: "Splendid New Architecture"
 je_gaudi_splendid_architecture_reason: "With the introduction of Art Nouveau and Art Deco, architects revolutionized the art world, for example by breaking with the rigid historicism of the past. But unlike many modern schools, their buildings were not an expression of mere functionality and objectivity. Art Deco is a development in the midst of the general awakening of classical modernism, in which the creative combination of elegance of form, preciousness of materials, strength of colors and sensuality of the topic was in the foreground. During its heyday, it represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. An architecture that respects these principles would make our nation a poster child of modernity and wealth."
 je_gaudi_splendid_architecture_goal: "#E Splendid Architecture#! reaches #BLUE 10#! points. At the moment, we have #G [ROOT.Var('gaudi_splendid_architecture').GetValue]#! points. Building Art Nouveau quarters, Art Deco Cinemas, Art Deco Skyscrapers, Art Deco Offices and Art Deco Airports via Journal Entry will give you more points."
 je_gaudi_art_nouveau_quarter: "Art Nouveau Quarter"
 je_gaudi_art_nouveau_quarter_reason: "The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Hôtel Tassel was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Horta's work in Brussels and applied the style for the entrances of the new Paris Métro. From Belgium and France, Art Nouveau spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country. It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities (Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany) as well as in centres of independence movements (Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain)."
 je_gaudi_art_deco_cinema: "Art Deco Cinema"
 je_gaudi_art_deco_cinema_reason: "Many of the best surviving examples of Art Deco are cinemas built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Art Deco period coincided with the conversion of silent films to sound, and movie companies built large display destinations in major cities to capture the huge audience that came to see movies. Movie palaces in the 1920s often combined exotic themes with art deco style; Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood (1922) was inspired by ancient Egyptian tombs and pyramids, while the Fox Theater in Bakersfield, California attached a tower in California Mission style to an Art Deco hall."
 je_gaudi_art_deco_skyscraper: "Art Deco Skyscraper"
 je_gaudi_art_deco_skyscraper_reason: "Skyscrapers are the bell towers of the present. But what is a bell tower without a distinctive chime? Refining a skyscraper in Art Deco style would be a prestigious endeavor that will draw admiration from around the world."
 je_gaudi_art_deco_airport: "Art Deco Airport"
 je_gaudi_art_deco_airport_reason: "Caravels once opened up the oceans to Europeans and connected the continents of the known world with the New. Now that the age of aviation has arrived, previously fixed frontiers are opening up. What style could be more appropriate than the luxurious and up-and-coming art deco to welcome the ports of the new flying ships? Aviators, say hello to the sun!"
 je_gaudi_art_deco_office: "Art Deco Office"
 je_gaudi_art_deco_office_reason: "The Art Deco style dominated the commercial world and entertainment industry, but the respective governments also wanted to impress with modern buildings that underlined the prosperity of the country and gave their own population the feeling of living in an aspiring nation."
 je_gaudi_bauhaus: "Bauhaus"
 je_gaudi_bauhaus_reason: "The Bauhaus was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts. The school became famous for its approach to design, which attempted to unify individual artistic vision with the principles of mass production and emphasis on function. It was grounded in the idea of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk (comprehensive artwork) in which all the arts would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, modernist architecture, and architectural education."

 je_gaudi_summer_burn: "Burning of the Summer Palace"
 je_gaudi_summer_burn_reason: "The Summer Palace has been the actual seat of the imperial family of the Qing Dynasty since the first half of the 18th century. It is the symbol of China's greatness and grandeur. A destruction meant not only a considerable humiliation of the enemy, but also opened up the chance for valuable loot..."
 je_gaudi_summer_burn_success: "Occupy the entire capital region #T Beijing#!."
 je_gaudi_ben_burn: "Burning Big Ben"
 je_gaudi_ben_burn_reason: "After the fire in Westminster Parliament, Great Britain built a new, iconic parliament building that underlines the claim of the Empire. Maybe it's time to bring British pride down to earth with another fire?"
 je_gaudi_ben_burn_success: "Occupy the entire capital region #T Home Countries#!."

 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_1: "Cologne Cathedral: Resumption of construction"
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_1_reason: "Cologne Cathedral is considered the most perfect Gothic cathedral in the world. Construction began in the 13th century and was of colossal proportions. After the completion of the choir building, work stalled until it was stopped altogether in the course of the 15th century. To this day, the construction crane from the late Middle Ages still towers over the half-finished south tower. With the revival of the national and romantic feeling in the German bourgeoisie and especially after the rediscovery of the original building plans and their dissemination, the conviction grows that the completion of the cathedral is not only a project for the glory of God, but also a symbol of German culture and the unity of the German nation."
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_1_goal: "#E Construction Progress#! reaches #BLUE 120#! points. At the moment, we have #G [GetGlobalVariable('gaudi_dombau_progress').GetValue]#! points. Normally, we get one point each month."
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_2: "Cologne Cathedral: South facade"
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_2_reason: "After the construction work had already lasted several years, the architects were faced with the construction and decoration of the southern facade of the cathedral. With its rich figural decoration, it is not only regarded as the pinnacle of German sculpture, but simply as one of the main works of Gothic revival architecture. The facade alone took thirteen years to build, and eighteen years to finish and decorate."
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_2_goal: "#E Construction Progress#! reaches #BLUE 120#! points. At the moment, we have #G [GetGlobalVariable('gaudi_dombau_progress').GetValue]#! points. Normally, we get one point each month."
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_3: "Cologne Cathedral: Roof structure"
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_3_reason: "The design of the Cologne Cathedral, which was based on the Gothic ideal, did not prevent the master builders from using the most modern building materials of the time. The roof structure was made of iron, making it the largest iron-steel structure in the world until the Eiffel Tower was built. Thanks to this decision, the construction survived even in the face of Allied bombing during World War II."
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_3_goal: "#E Construction Progress#! reaches #BLUE 120#! points. At the moment, we have #G [GetGlobalVariable('gaudi_dombau_progress').GetValue]#! points. Normally, we get one point each month."
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_4: "Cologne Cathedral: West facade and towers"
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_4_reason: "The west facade of the cathedral is the largest church facade ever built. It follows in detail the medieval plan developed by master builder Michael von Savoyen, which was recorded in 1370 in the so-called façade plan F. Characteristic of the silhouette of Cologne Cathedral is the twin-tower facade with the two towering spiers. Master Michael had designed an octagonal, fully openwork tracery spire crowned by a tiered finial. With these solutions, which explored the limits of what is technically possible, the Gothic architects wanted to emphasize that the building wanted to be 'a monumental reliquary' housing the Three Wise Men inside."
 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_4_goal: "#E Construction Progress#! reaches #BLUE 120#! points. At the moment, we have #G [GetGlobalVariable('gaudi_dombau_progress').GetValue]#! points. Normally, we get one point each month."

 je_gaudi_gotthard_survey: "Gotthard Railway: Plan and survey"
 je_gaudi_gotthard_survey_reason: "In the 19th century, Switzerland was in danger of being bypassed in international rail traffic and thus not only losing touch with the modern transport system but also with the Industrial Revolution. With the opening of a railway line over the Brenner Pass, this danger took on a new dimension. Geographically, Switzerland had bigger problems than Austria: the Brenner Pass was much easier to negotiate than the Swiss alternative routes. Decades of discussions about the route and the financing of such a project preceded the construction of an Alpine railway in Switzerland. The Zurich politician and entrepreneur Alfred Escher played a key role in determining the Gotthard line."
 je_gaudi_gotthard_survey_goal: "#E Planning Progress#! reaches #BLUE 60#! points. At the moment, we have #G [GetGlobalVariable('gaudi_gotthard_progress').GetValue]#! points. Normally, we get one point each month."
 je_gaudi_gotthard_construction: "Gotthard Railway: Construction"
 je_gaudi_gotthard_construction_reason: "The construction of the Gotthard railway is considered one of the largest construction projects of the 19th century and is compared to the construction of the Suez Canal in terms of its dimensions and technical hurdles. Right from the start, the core and most ambitious part was the realization of a tunnel through the Gotthard massif. When it opened in 1882, the Gotthard summit tunnel was the longest tunnel in the world at 15 kilometers. Around one hundred small and large bridges, mainly made of iron and steel, are another part of this ambitious route, which not only connects northern and southern Europe, but also represents a symbol of Swiss unity."
 je_gaudi_gotthard_construction_goal: "#E Construction Progress#! reaches #BLUE 120#! points. At the moment, we have #G [GetGlobalVariable('gaudi_gotthard_progress').GetValue]#! points. Normally, we get one point each month."
 je_gaudi_gotthard_discontent: "Gotthart Railway: Worker Discontent"
 je_gaudi_gotthard_discontent_reason: "The working conditions during the construction of the Gotthard railway were tough, even by contemporary standards. The working class was largely made up of foreigners, mainly from the poorer northern Alpine valleys of Italy, who had de facto no rights. In particular, the work in the Gotthard tunnel was considered life-threatening and poorly paid. This repeatedly led to disagreements with the construction management, which at least at one point even threatened the entire project."
 je_gaudi_gotthard_discontent_goal: "If the #E Workers' Dissatisfaction#! reaches the maximum value of #BLUE 10#! points, a strike may break out! At the moment the value is #R [GetGlobalVariable('gaudi_gotthard_discontent').GetValue]#! points."

 je_gaudi_cristo: "Cristo Redentor: Construction"
 je_gaudi_cristo_reason: "Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss first suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado in the mid-1850s to honor Princess Isabel, regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project was not approved. The Catholic Circle of Rio made a second proposal for a landmark statue on the mountain in 1920. Local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and artist Carlos Oswald designed the statue. French sculptor Paul Landowski created the work. The Art Deco statue would later gain worldwide fame as a symbol of Rio de Janeiro next to the Sugar Loaf."

 je_gaudi_mole_phase_1: "Mole Antonelliana: From Synagogue to National Symbol"
 je_gaudi_mole_phase_1_reason: "The Mole Antonelliana is a pavilion-like building with its high, sharply tapering essay designed by the Turin architect Alessandro Antonelli. It was started as a synagogue on behalf of the Jewish community, but the architect's excessive ambition led to a project that went beyond the original plans. Costs skyrocketed and completion was delayed for years. Despite ambitious attempts, the Jewish community was finally unable to raise any more money. However, the people of Turin advocated that the project be taken over by the local government in order to complete the building, which was already impressive in its rough form, and dedicate it to Italian unity."
 je_gaudi_mole_phase_1_goal: "#E Construction Progress#! reaches #BLUE 120#! points. At the moment, we have #G [GetGlobalVariable('gaudi_mole_progress').GetValue]#! points. Normally, we get one point each month."
 je_gaudi_mole_phase_2: "Mole Antonelliana: Lantern and Spire"
 je_gaudi_mole_phase_2_reason: "Antonelli kept making changes to his building, for example by adding the so-called 'tempietto' - a neoclassical hexagonal colonnade with two floors and a square base - which therefore takes up the basic pronaos style. Antonelli's original vision for the spire was to top it off with a five-pointed star, but he later opted for a statue instead, depicting a winged genie, or 'genio alato'. The statue was commissioned to the sculptor Fumagalli, months after Antonelli's death. The design included an embossed and gilded copper genie holding a lance in one hand and a palm branch in the other. On its head was a small five-pointed star supported by a pole. When the star was set in its place on 10 April 1889, it brought the total height of the Mole to 167.5 m (550 ft), making it the tallest brick building in Europe at the time."

From the 1860s to 1890s, many large public buildings were erected along the Ringstrasse in an eclectic historicist style, sometimes called Ringstraßenstil ('Ring Road style'), using elements of Classical, Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque architecture. Numerous public and private buildings were erected along the entire ring road. Aristocrats and other wealthy private individuals hastened to have representative palaces (ring road palaces) built in the monumental historicist style."

 gaudi_dombau_phase_1_decision: "Complete the Cologne Cathedral"
 gaudi_dombau_phase_1_decision_desc: "Cologne Cathedral is considered the most perfect Gothic cathedral in the world. Construction began in the 13th century and was of colossal proportions. After the completion of the choir building, work stalled until it was stopped altogether in the course of the 15th century. To this day, the construction crane from the late Middle Ages still towers over the half-finished south tower. With the revival of the national and romantic feeling in the German bourgeoisie and especially after the rediscovery of the original building plans and their dissemination, the conviction grows that the completion of the cathedral is not only a project for the glory of God, but also a symbol of German culture and the unity of the German nation."
 gaudi_dombau_phase_2_decision: "South Facade of Cologne Cathedral"
 gaudi_dombau_phase_2_decision_desc: "After the construction work had already lasted several years, the architects were faced with the construction and decoration of the southern facade of the cathedral. With its rich figural decoration, it is not only regarded as the pinnacle of German sculpture, but simply as one of the main works of Gothic revival architecture. The facade alone took thirteen years to build, and eighteen years to finish and decorate."
 gaudi_dombau_phase_3_decision: "Roof structure of Cologne Cathedral"
 gaudi_dombau_phase_3_decision_desc: "The design of the Cologne Cathedral, which was based on the Gothic ideal, did not prevent the master builders from using the most modern building materials of the time. The roof structure was made of iron, making it the largest iron-steel structure in the world until the Eiffel Tower was built. Thanks to this decision, the construction survived even in the face of Allied bombing during World War II."
 gaudi_dombau_phase_4_decision: "West facade and towers of Cologne Cathedral"
 gaudi_dombau_phase_4_decision_desc: "The west facade of the cathedral is the largest church facade ever built. It follows in detail the medieval plan developed by master builder Michael von Savoyen, which was recorded in 1370 in the so-called façade plan F. Characteristic of the silhouette of Cologne Cathedral is the twin-tower facade with the two towering spiers. Master Michael had designed an octagonal, fully openwork tracery spire crowned by a tiered finial. With these solutions, which explored the limits of what is technically possible, the Gothic architects wanted to emphasize that the building wanted to be 'a monumental reliquary' housing the Three Wise Men inside."

 gaudi_gotthard_survey_decision: "Plan and survey the Gotthard Railway"
 gaudi_gotthard_survey_decision_desc: "In the 19th century, Switzerland was in danger of being bypassed in international rail traffic and thus not only losing touch with the modern transport system but also with the Industrial Revolution. With the opening of a railway line over the Brenner Pass, this danger took on a new dimension. Geographically, Switzerland had bigger problems than Austria: the Brenner Pass was much easier to negotiate than the Swiss alternative routes. Decades of discussions about the route and the financing of such a project preceded the construction of an Alpine railway in Switzerland. The Zurich politician and entrepreneur Alfred Escher played a key role in determining the Gotthard line."
 gaudi_gotthard_construction_decision: "Construct the Gotthard Railway"
 gaudi_gotthard_construction_decision_desc: "The construction of the Gotthard railway is considered one of the largest construction projects of the 19th century and is compared to the construction of the Suez Canal in terms of its dimensions and technical hurdles. Right from the start, the core and most ambitious part was the realization of a tunnel through the Gotthard massif. When it opened in 1882, the Gotthard summit tunnel was the longest tunnel in the world at 15 kilometers. Around one hundred small and large bridges, mainly made of iron and steel, are another part of this ambitious route, which not only connects northern and southern Europe, but also represents a symbol of Swiss unity."

The Catholic Circle of Rio made a second proposal for a landmark statue on the mountain in 1920. Local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and artist Carlos Oswald designed the statue. French sculptor Paul Landowski created the work. The Art Deco statue would later gain worldwide fame as a symbol of Rio de Janeiro next to the Sugar Loaf."

 gaudi_mole_phase_1_decision_desc: "The Mole Antonelliana is a pavilion-like building with its high, sharply tapering essay designed by the Turin architect Alessandro Antonelli. It was started as a synagogue on behalf of the Jewish community, but the architect's excessive ambition led to a project that went beyond the original plans. Costs skyrocketed and completion was delayed for years. Despite ambitious attempts, the Jewish community was finally unable to raise any more money. However, the people of Turin advocated that the project be taken over by the local government in order to complete the building, which was already impressive in its rough form, and dedicate it to Italian unity."

 gaudi_mole_phase_2_decision_desc: "Antonelli kept making changes to his building, for example by adding the so-called 'tempietto' - a neoclassical hexagonal colonnade with two floors and a square base - which therefore takes up the basic pronaos style. Antonelli's original vision for the spire was to top it off with a five-pointed star, but he later opted for a statue instead, depicting a winged genie, or 'genio alato'. The statue was commissioned to the sculptor Fumagalli, months after Antonelli's death. The design included an embossed and gilded copper genie holding a lance in one hand and a palm branch in the other. On its head was a small five-pointed star supported by a pole. When the star was set in its place on 10 April 1889, it brought the total height of the Mole to 167.5 m (550 ft), making it the tallest brick building in Europe at the time."

 gaudi.11.f: "The Vienna Secession is an art movement, closely related to Art Nouveau, that was formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian painters, graphic artists, sculptors and architects, including Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, Otto Wagner and Gustav Klimt. They resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists in protest against its support for more traditional artistic styles. Their most influential architectural work was the Secession Building designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich as a venue for expositions of the group. Their official magazine was called Ver Sacrum (Sacred Spring, in Latin), which published highly stylised and influential works of graphic art. In 1905 the group itself split, when some of the most prominent members, including Klimt, Wagner, and Hoffmann, resigned in a dispute over priorities, but it continued to function, and still functions today, from its headquarters in the Secession Building. In its current form, the Secession exhibition gallery is independently led and managed by artists."

 gaudi.21.f: "The debut of Art Nouveau architecture in Brussels was accompanied by a wave of Decorative Art in the new style. Important artists included Gustave Strauven, who used wrought iron to achieve baroque effects on Brussels facades; the furniture designer Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, known for his highly original chairs and articulated metal furniture; and the jewellery designer Philippe Wolfers, who made jewellery in the form of dragonflies, butterflies, swans and serpents. The style was quickly noticed in neighbouring France. After visiting Horta's Hôtel Tassel, Hector Guimard built the Castel Béranger, among the first Paris buildings in the new style. Parisians welcomed Guimard's original and picturesque style; the Castel Béranger was chosen as one of the best new façades in Paris, launching Guimard's career. The Paris 1900 Exposition universelle marked the high point of Art Nouveau. Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware, furniture and decorative objects of the style. While the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much to popularize the style."

Many of these movie theaters still survive, though many have been divided in the interior into smaller screening halls.

As a result, the United States soon took the lead in building tall buildings. The first skyscrapers had been built in Chicago in the 1880s in the Beaux-Arts or neoclassical style. In the 1920s, New York architects used the new Art Deco style to build the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. The Empire State building was the tallest building in the world for forty years. The decoration of the interior and exterior of the skyscrapers was classic Art Deco, with geometric shapes and zigzag patterns. The Chrysler Building updated the traditional gargoyles on Gothic cathedrals with sculptures on the building corners in the shape of Chrysler radiator ornaments."

 gaudi.33.f: "At the beginning of the new century, airports were the symbol of progress: the conquest of the sky, which had long been considered an unattainable dream of mankind, suddenly became a matter of course. Pilots competed, broke records and tried to circumnavigate the world: in them the ideal of the ancient hero was mixed with the latest technology. At the same time, the passenger flight was a status symbol. The exquisite and the luxurious clung to him. Art Deco airports took up this subject and transformed it into a suggestive imagery, either through decorations or gigantic proportions."

However, over time, the style also spread to state institutions. City halls, courthouses and government buildings - such as post offices - were soon to adopt this style as well."

Art has two principles, the Idea, which produces European art, and the Chimera, which produces oriental art. The Summer Palace was to chimerical art what the Parthenon is to ideal art. It was a kind of tremendous unknown masterpiece, glimpsed from the distance in a kind of twilight, like a silhouette of the civilization of Asia on the horizon of the civilization of Europe.\nThis wonder has disappeared.\nOne day two bandits entered the Summer Palace. One plundered, the other burned. Victory can be a thieving woman, or so it seems. The devastation of the Summer Palace was accomplished by the two victors acting jointly.  One of the two victors filled his pockets; when the other saw this he filled his coffers. And back they came to Europe, arm in arm, laughing away. Such is the story of the two bandits.\nWe Europeans are the civilized ones, and for us the Chinese are the barbarians. This is what civilization has done to barbarism.' - Victor Hugo"

 gaudi.100.d: "The idealization of the Middle Ages in the course of Romanticism has led to more and more people regarding the completion of Cologne Cathedral as a national task."
 gaudi.100.f: "In 1770 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was enthusiastic about the Gothic Strasbourg Cathedral and thus triggered a romantically based rediscovery of the Gothic architectural style. Later, publicists celebrated Cologne Cathedral as a work of art that was still waiting to be completed. Finally, the Catholic publicist Joseph Görres shifted the argument when in 1814 he praised the cathedral as a national sanctuary and thus made it a symbol for the desired German national state. Sulpiz Boisserée, an art dealer based in Cologne, was at the center of the persistent campaigning for the completion of the cathedral. His efforts received a boost when, in 1814 and 1816, he and Georg Moller were able to rediscover the façade plan from 1370 that underlies the west façade of the cathedral. Between 1821 and 1831 Boisserée published a series of engravings showing the completed cathedral. This work significantly promoted enthusiasm for cathedral construction throughout Germany. The romantic transfiguration of the Gothic, which was understood at the time as a genuinely German architectural style, and the stylization of the cathedral as a German national monument finally won over the Prussian Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm to the cathedral project. The idea of completing the cathedral, originally pursued in Cologne, thus became a Prussian and even national-German matter and, for the first time, a realistic option."

 gaudi.101.f: "On September 4, 1842, Prussia's King Friedrich Wilhelm IV and the coadjutor and later Archbishop Johannes von Geissel laid the foundation stone for the further construction of the cathedral. The stone was pulled up to the still unfinished south tower and walled in there."
 gaudi.101.g: "A new construction phase begins."
 gaudi.102.t: "First Construction Phase finished"
 gaudi.102.d: "We have completed the first construction phase of Cologne Cathedral."
 gaudi.102.f: "Just six years after the foundation stone was laid to complete the cathedral, all of the side aisles of the nave and transept were vaulted and the central aisles were raised above the triforium. Above the triforium, a roof truss, open at the bottom, was installed so that the areas of the nave and transept could be used despite the ongoing work above."
 gaudi.102.g: "Let's continue the good work."
 gaudi.103.t: "Second Construction Phase begins"
 gaudi.103.d: "Our builders have started to erect and decorate the south facade of the cathedral."
 gaudi.103.f: "In the Middle Ages, the builders had already completed the choir, but neglected the nave and transept. After the construction progress had progressed on both, one could now concentrate on the design of the large facades on the long sides, whereby the north facade was kept simpler than the south facade."
 gaudi.104.t: "Second Construction Phase finished"
 gaudi.104.d: "We have completed the second construction phase of Cologne Cathedral."
 gaudi.104.f: "The southern façade was designed by master builder Ernst Friedrich Zwirner, who coordinated his plans with Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Sulpiz Boisserée and King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. It was built between 1842 and 1855 and is today considered one of the most important and artistically most perfect works of neo-Gothic. In the façade there is the Ursula Portal on the left, the Passion Portal in the middle and the Gereons Portal on the right."
 gaudi.105.t: "Third Construction Phase begins"
 gaudi.105.d: "After several arguments, our engineers have started work on the cathedral roof."
 gaudi.105.f: "Against strong resistance from numerous sponsors of the completion of the cathedral, who advocated wooden roof trusses, as they also existed over the areas of the cathedral completed in the Middle Ages, master builder Ernst Friedrich Zwirner had the roofs and the crossing tower erected as iron structures. He cited cost savings, lower weight and lower fire load as arguments for such a modern construction."
 gaudi.106.t: "Third Construction Phase finished"
 gaudi.106.d: "We have completed the third construction phase of Cologne Cathedral."
 gaudi.106.f: "In 1863 the nave and transept were completed except for the area between the towers. The provisional dividing wall, which had separated the completed chancel from the unfinished area for centuries, could now be demolished and almost the entire interior of the cathedral could be experienced for the first time."

 gaudi.107.f: "After the completion of the nave and transept, the towers were finally completed. The Dombauhütte, which employed more than 500 people at the time, relied on the most modern construction technology, e.g. on winch wagons that drove on railroad tracks over the construction site or on the use of a steam engine."

 gaudi.108.d: "Today is a glorious day for architecture and German culture: Cologne Cathedral was completed after decades of work. Verily we have surpassed the Gothic masters!"
 gaudi.108.f: "When the cathedral was finally completed, it was the tallest building in the world with its two towers, which were over 157 meters high - even though the medieval facade plan, which had been drawn up 600 years earlier, around 1280/90, was followed very closely when it was built , had arisen. Only the Eiffel Tower, a product of the industrial age, was to trump the height that had already been planned in the Middle Ages after its completion."

Another nation, should it have a German primary culture, can continue building the cathedral at the last construction phase. Foreign invaders, on the other hand, will show no interest in further construction."

 gaudi.111.t: "Inferior material"
 gaudi.111.d: "The last delivery of material for the Cologne Cathedral turned out to be poor."
 gaudi.111.f: "The first observation revealed that the stone that had been brought in had porous spots. The master builder therefore rejected the charge without further ado. This would certainly delay construction and incur additional costs, but quality wins out in the end. At the same time, there are some who say that not only should we use the stone for cost and time reasons, but that we should save some of the better building material to use the proceeds... elsewhere."

 gaudi.114.g: "What a tragedy!"
 gaudi.115.t: "New jobs"
 gaudi.115.d: "The construction of the cathedral led to a large influx of people to Cologne."
 gaudi.115.f: "As in the Middle Ages, the construction of the cathedral created many new demands on city life, which often could only be met by new workers. Not only the construction workers themselves have to be recruited. They also depend on restaurants and shops, suppliers and the construction of new apartments, which also have to be built by someone. This has led to an upswing in Cologne, from which some want to benefit directly or indirectly."
 gaudi.115.g: "A great project needs great people."
 gaudi.116.t: "Political controversy over the cathedral"
 gaudi.116.d: "Not everyone is sympathetic to the completion of Cologne Cathedral. A labor leader publicly castigated this 'waste' today."
 gaudi.116.f: "'And I ask you, gentlemen - what prompts the state to such horrendous spending, which only favors clericalism, nationalism and capitalism? The powerful increase in prestige, the rich increase their profits by participating in construction, and the Church, which instills superstition and backwardness in the proletariat, emerges strengthened from this reactionary policy. But who, I ask you, builds these cloud cuckoo homes of luxury and waste? Right, the common worker! The common laborer who is maltreated and maimed or killed in construction accidents, and whose only reward is the prospect of a nonexistent kingdom of heaven. This medieval cathedral represents everything that is going wrong in this nation!'"

With the forthcoming completion of Cologne Cathedral, our nation has freed itself from earlier decadence and is following in the footsteps of its ancestors. When has any country ever implemented a major project? You have to go back to the cathedral builders of the Middle Ages - or even to the builders of the pyramids. We are entering historical territory. And future generations, as they look up at the colossal towers, will remember that we made the right decision back then. A cathedral is more than a church. It is a monument, an inspiring building that will inspire many Germans to do new things in decades and centuries to come!'"

 gaudi.118.t: "A national or a religious Project?"
 gaudi.118.d: "There is currently a serious debate in Parliament as to whether the Cologne Cathedral is primarily a national or a religious building."
 gaudi.118.f: "The importance of the cathedral for the Germans as a 'united' people was important from the very beginning when considerations began to complete the medieval building. The Middle Ages were considered by many to be a place of reflection for the German nation, as the Holy Roman Empire, especially under the Salians and Staufers, was perceived as the high point of Germany. Others saw it as a dilution of the Christian idea. After all, the cathedral was not just a church, but the seat of one of the most powerful bishops in Germany. Cologne's Christian history began in the Roman Empire, and the question of God and nation could often lead to divisive rather than conciliatory tendencies."

 gaudi.119.t: "Cathedral building lottery"
 gaudi.119.d: "The cathedral building lottery made such extraordinary profits this year that the cathedral construction can progress much faster than expected."
 gaudi.119.f: "Originally, master builder Zwirner had estimated 1.2 million thalers for the completion of the nave and the same sum for the buttresses. On this basis, the annual construction costs were calculated at 100,000 thalers, half of which the Prussian king wanted to cover with a building fund. In order to raise the remaining construction costs, the Central Cathedral Building Association (Zentral-Dombau-Verein) in Cologne was founded, which was initially financed by contributions. When the interior was completed in 1863, projections showed that, assuming the same financial flow, it would take another 50 years to complete. So the association decided in 1864 to set up a cathedral lottery, which proved to be a good source of money. Overall, the Dombau-Verein bore around 60 percent of all costs, the state was only involved in around 32 percent of the cathedral building costs."
 gaudi.119.g: "Jackpot!"

 gaudi.120.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetFullName] has a great personal interest in the romantic movement. He therefore submitted a personal donation for the construction of the cathedral."
 gaudi.120.f: "From a historical point of view, the construction of the Cologne Cathedral was also due to a certain extent to the personal initiative of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, who was considered god-fearing and associated with romanticism. Throughout his life he had a keen interest in art and architecture."

 gaudi.121.t: "A sightseeing tour"
 gaudi.121.d: "The Cologne Cathedral is still under construction, but the progress is remarkable. We should invite an ally and show him everything."
 gaudi.121.f: "Even as an unfinished building, Cologne Cathedral impressed visitors and stimulated their imagination. This also applied to the time when the cathedral was again a construction site for decades. Robert Schumann was inspired to write his 3rd symphony at the sight of the further construction, and Queen Victoria was shown around and informed about the project during a visit."
 gaudi.121.g: "Invite our ally to visit Cologne."
 gaudi.121.h: "This will only disturb our efforts."
 gaudi.122.t: "A donation to Cologne Cathedral?"
 gaudi.122.d: "Our ambassador was invited to a tour of the Cologne Cathedral construction site. It was an impressive sightseeing tour and now the ambassador is asking if we might want to garner international prestige for ourselves as a donor to the cathedral."
 gaudi.122.f: "Even as an unfinished building, Cologne Cathedral impressed visitors and stimulated their imagination. This also applied to the time when the cathedral was again a construction site for decades. Robert Schumann was inspired to write his 3rd symphony at the sight of the further construction, and Queen Victoria was shown around and informed about the project during a visit."

 gaudi.123.g: "One recognizes true friends immediately."
 gaudi.124.t: "New machines in Cologne"
 gaudi.124.d: "The use of state-of-the-art machines speeds up the laborious construction of the Cologne Cathedral by months."
 gaudi.124.f: "The use of steam engines in particular helped to draw material to the higher levels of the cathedral. But many other technological achievements also helped to make work much more efficient than in the Middle Ages."
 gaudi.124.g: "This is progress!"
 gaudi.125.t: "The railway brings stones to the cathedral"
 gaudi.125.d: "The establishment of a railway in the area around Cologne has meant that the construction of the cathedral has been accelerated by several months."
 gaudi.125.f: "The classic route of the building material to Cologne was the Rhine shipping. In the years that followed, it remained the preferred method for bringing large quantities to the cathedral city. However, the growing railway traffic also contributed to the fact that the supply routes could change in an emergency or that people and machines could be transported faster."
 gaudi.126.t: "Stormy weather"
 gaudi.126.d: "A storm set our cathedral work in Cologne back by weeks."
 gaudi.126.f: "A thunderstorm hit Cologne last night. The wind ripped off tarpaulins and knocked over scaffolding, damaging some gargoyles and figures."

 gaudi.127.t: "Archaeological investigations in Cologne"
 gaudi.127.d: "After a visit to Cologne, [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_archaeologist').GetFullName] discovered that the cathedral apparently stands on Roman ruins. He asks for an excavation license."
 gaudi.127.f: "Cologne is one of the oldest cities in Germany and was an important colony in the Roman Empire. The Roman legacy continued to prevail in Cologne's urban consciousness, both in the municipally organized commune and in the Christian reference to St. Peter and the stylization as the daughter of Rome. The city center has been proven to stand on Roman ruins, even some streets have survived. Due to the dense development, however, no one has dared to dig on the spot. An excavation near the cathedral would significantly affect the construction work, but could help our archaeologist to gain valuable experience."
 gaudi.127.g: "We cannot afford such a long halt to construction."
 gaudi.127.h: "A unique archaeological opportunity."

 gaudi.200.t: "Rise of Alfred Escher"
 gaudi.200.d: "In 1849, the industrialist Alfred Escher was elected President of the National Council for the first time. As a politician, banker, head of an important railway company and implementer of the Gotthard tunnel, he was to become one of the most influential figures in Swiss history."
 gaudi.200.f: "Johann Heinrich Alfred Escher vom Glas, known as Alfred Escher, was a Swiss politician, business leader and railway entrepreneur. Through his numerous political offices and his founding and management activities at the Swiss Northeastern Railway, the Swiss Federal Polytechnic, the Swiss Credit Institute, the Swiss Life Insurance and Pension Fund and the Gotthard Railway Company, Escher influenced the political and economic development of Switzerland like no other 19th century."
 gaudi.200.g: "He will serve Switzerland well."
 gaudi.200.h: "This man is too dangerous"
 gaudi.201.t: "Disempowerment of Alfred Escher"
 gaudi.201.d: "The construction of the Gotthard railway strained Alfred Escher's capacities. His rivals took the opportunity to urge him first to resign as president of the Schweizer Kreditanstalt and then to give up the chairmanship of the Gotthard railway company."
 gaudi.201.f: "Through his numerous political offices and through his business foundations of the Nordostbahn and the Kreditanstalt, Escher had an extraordinary wealth of power, due to which he was titled 'King Alfred I.'. This supremacy drew critics to the scene. The democratic movement demanded more say for the people in political issues. The sworn circle of politicians around Alfred Escher - the 'Escher system' - became the declared enemy of the democrats. This was fought against with pamphlets and popular assemblies, which ultimately weakened his influence. It became even more difficult by the fact that his Northeast Railway increasingly slipped into financial crisis in the 1870s."
 gaudi.201.g: "Is his fall imminent?"
 gaudi.202.t: "Death of Alfred Escher"
 gaudi.202.d: "Alfred Escher, perhaps the figure with the greatest impact in Switzerland in the 19th century, passed away today."
 gaudi.202.f: "In addition to the attacks on his person, Escher had to contend with health problems. He fell ill again and again throughout his life and was forced to recover with longer cures. His susceptibility to illness did not go well with his heavy workload. During the critical phase of the Gotthard project, Escher almost worked himself to death. Constant health ups and downs followed: asthma, fever, eye problems, boils. However, this did not prevent Escher from fulfilling his political and economic obligations whenever possible. At the end of November 1882 he became seriously ill again. On the morning of December 6, 1882, Alfred Escher died on his estate 'Belvoir'."
 gaudi.202.g: "He led Switzerland into the modern age."

 gaudi.211.t: "Planning the Gotthard Railway"
 gaudi.211.d: "We have started planning the Gotthard project. In addition to land surveying and route determination, this also includes the search for foreign donors and the establishment of a company to ensure financial support."
 gaudi.211.f: "In 1852, the head of the federal railway office, Gottlieb Koller, presented a first project to build a railway line through the Gotthard massif, and on August 19, 1853, the first Gotthard committee, made up of nine cantons, was organised. Engineer Koller developed a first project for the route from Flüelen to Lake Langen. In 1861, the Zurich engineer Kaspar Wetli measured the route from Erstfeld to Lugano in just five months, which is still considered a masterpiece of surveying technology today."
 gaudi.211.g: "A mammoth task."
 gaudi.212.t: "Planning finished"
 gaudi.212.d: "The planning and preparations for the construction of the Gotthard railway have been completed. With the right prerequisites, we can give the go-ahead for construction."
 gaudi.212.f: "After fierce arguments between Gotthard supporters and advocates of the Lukmanier and Splügen variants, the idea of a tunnel under the Gotthard was presented for the first time in 1863 by the engineers Wetli and Koller. The decision was made when Alfred Escher, the president of the Zurich-based Swiss Northeastern Railway, finally endorsed the route over the Gotthard. In addition, the route over the Gotthard was the shortest. 'I have long been convinced that as a result of the design of the railway network in Switzerland and our neighboring countries, a railway over the Gotthard would be much more beneficial to the interests of Zurich and the Northeastern Railway than a railway over an Alpine pass in Graubünden,' says Escher."
 gaudi.212.g: "The hard part is just beginning..."
 gaudi.213.t: "Constructing the Gotthard Railway"
 gaudi.213.d: "The construction work on the Gotthard massif - on the northern side near Göschenen and on the southern side near Airolo - has begun. The Gotthard railway company hired thousands of workers, mainly from Italy."
 gaudi.213.f: "After an extremely short submission period of six weeks, seven offers for the construction of the Gotthard tunnel were received. The Geneva company 'Entreprise du Grand Tunnel du Gothard' of Louis Favre was awarded the contract. The biggest competitor was the Italian company 'Società Italiana di Lavori Pubblici' headed by Severino Grattoni. Grattoni had already built the world's longest tunnel, the Mont Cenis railway tunnel, at 12 kilometers. He had also dealt with the Gotthard, had examined the geology and carried out test drilling. Favre, who had never built a tunnel longer than 1,000 meters, undercut his fellow competitors, accepted the ruinous terms of the contract and posted a deposit of CHF 8 million. He promised a construction period of eight years - a risky undertaking in view of the unknown geology."
 gaudi.213.g: "Favre should be lucky to be part of this historic work."
 gaudi.214.t: "Gotthard Railway finished!"
 gaudi.214.d: "Today is a big day for our country: with the completion of the Gotthard railway, not only Northern and Southern Europe were connected, but also Switzerland became a crossroads for international rail traffic."
 gaudi.214.f: "'Basically, I hate the mountains because they are cold and eat away pieces of the sky, i.e. the ball of light, and reduce the horizon. My favorite fantasy now is to blow up the Gotthard with all the Alps with dynamite on the other side, to the north, so that we could get Italian air directly.' - Carl Spitteler"
 gaudi.214.g: "Heil Dir, Gotthardbahn!"
 gaudi.219.t: "Eastern Switzerland lost!"
 gaudi.219.d: "With the loss of Eastern Switzerland, we lost every opportunity to continue building the Gotthard Railway."
 gaudi.219.f: "Should Eastern Switzerland be lost for any reason, the construction progress will not be lost as a whole. Another nation can continue building the tunnel at the last construction phase."
 gaudi.219.g: "We can't leave Eastern Switzerland to them for long!"

 gaudi.221.t: "Credit from Italy"
 gaudi.221.d: "Alfred Escher has met a number of Italian businessmen in Milan who want to invest in the construction of the Gotthard railway and have good connections with the government."
 gaudi.221.f: "The construction costs of the route network of the future Gotthard railway company were estimated at 187 million Swiss francs before construction began. The largest part (54.55%) of the funds had to be raised from the international capital market, Italy subsidized 24.05%, Germany and Switzerland 10.7% each. A finance consortium led by German banks was set up to raise the CHF 102 million on the capital market. It consisted of a German, Italian and Swiss group, each of whom had to raise CHF 34 million."
 gaudi.221.g: "All help is appreciated."
 gaudi.221.h: "We don't need help from foreigners."
 gaudi.222.t: "Credit from Germany"
 gaudi.222.d: "Alfred Escher has met a number of German businessmen who wish to invest in the construction of the Gotthard railway and who are on good terms with the government."
 gaudi.222.f: "The construction costs of the route network of the future Gotthard railway company were estimated at 187 million Swiss francs before construction began. The largest part (54.55%) of the funds had to be raised from the international capital market, Italy subsidized 24.05%, Germany and Switzerland 10.7% each. A finance consortium led by German banks was set up to raise the CHF 102 million on the capital market. It consisted of a German, Italian and Swiss group, each of whom had to raise CHF 34 million."
 gaudi.223.t: "Gotthardbahn-Gesellschaft"
 gaudi.223.d: "With the founding of the Gotthard Railway Company (Gotthardbahn-Gesellschaft), an important step was taken towards the realization of this ambitious project."
 gaudi.223.f: "The Gotthard Railway Company was founded in Lucerne as a stock corporation to build and operate the Gotthard Railway. The political decisions and negotiations for the financing of the Gotthard railway in the run-up to the founding of the Gotthard railway company and its management in the early days of construction were essentially made by the former President of the Government Council of the Canton of Zurich and later three-time President of the National Council, Dr. Alfred Escher coined. After the financing of the Gotthard project had been secured almost exclusively by state subsidies from Switzerland, its cantons and from 1869 by Italy, the North German Confederation and its legal successor from 1871 the German Reich, the Gotthard Railway Company was founded from the Gotthard Association, which transferred its rights to the Gotthard Railway Company. Alfred Escher became its president and Joseph Zingg its vice president. The company then tackled the actual construction of the Gotthard railway."

 gaudi.231.t: "Water ingress in the tunnel"
 gaudi.231.d: "Water ingress in the Gotthard tunnel threatens construction progress and the lives of the workers."
 gaudi.231.f: "The different rock layers in the Gotthard massif repeatedly caused problems. Sometimes sandy foundations alternated with impenetrable rock - and in rare, but all the more dangerous cases, water or a rocky pulp penetrated the tunnel, which became fatal for some workers."
 gaudi.231.g: "Do what is necessary to seal the site, safety first."
 gaudi.231.h: "Pay the workers extra hours to fix the rift, but be careful."
 gaudi.231.i: "Plug the hole at all costs and keep working - regardless of the losses!"
 gaudi.232.t: "Viaduct stress test"
 gaudi.232.d: "The construction management is unsure whether the many stress tests that we carry out on the numerous viaducts are really necessary in this number, as they take up material and time."
 gaudi.232.f: "Given the time pressure to complete the Gotthard Railway, not all projects can enjoy the same level of attention. For example, some engineers consider the multiple load tests on one of our viaducts to be unnecessary - the structure is strong enough. However, some of our consultants insist on not stopping testing prematurely, as damage could set our work back months and tarnish our reputation."
 gaudi.232.g: "We should do an extra test."
 gaudi.232.h: "I have no concerns that this viaduct will be unstable."
 gaudi.233.t: "Viaduct collapses!"
 gaudi.233.d: "One of our viaducts collapsed today. Apparently it wasn't as safe as we thought."
 gaudi.233.f: "How dare you damage the reputation of Swiss precision and thoroughness like that?"
 gaudi.233.g: "I said right away that we should have done a stress test!"
 gaudi.234.t: "More work breaks"
 gaudi.234.d: "Gotthard tunnel workers find their shifts too long and their breaks too short."
 gaudi.234.f: "Apart from the risky work in the Gotthard tunnel, the very poor air circulation caused problems. The interior of the earth also heated up to more than 33 degrees (and in rare cases: to 40 degrees) inside the tunnel. Nevertheless, the workers had to carry out their arduous and sweaty work for more than 8 hours a day."
 gaudi.234.g: "A break? Bah! Those lazy Italians don't even know what work is!"
 gaudi.234.h: "A little break, nothing more."
 gaudi.234.i: "Give them a bonus instead of a break."
 gaudi.234.j: "They deserve regular breaks."
 gaudi.235.t: "Dizziness underground"
 gaudi.235.d: "The poor air quality in the Gotthard tunnel has gotten so bad that some workers have collapsed from dizziness."
 gaudi.235.f: "The air quality in the Gotthard reaches an alarmingly low level. The dust thrown up by the pickaxes and machines has a part in it; however, the dynamite does the rest. Far too often workers are sent back into the tunnel before the smoke from the blasts has cleared. One of our wardens wanted to urge the lazy bunch back to work, but succumbed to an unfortunate cardiovascular problem on the way inside the tunnel."
 gaudi.235.g: "That is unfortunate. Now continue working!"
 gaudi.235.h: "Give the workers a greater incentive to risk their lives..."
 gaudi.235.i: "Introduce shorter shift changes."
 gaudi.236.t: "Extortionate prices"
 gaudi.236.d: "Our pricing policy for food, clothing and other necessities has been heavily criticized by the workers of the Gotthard tunnel."
 gaudi.236.f: "A maximum of 1645 workers worked in Göschenen and 1302 in Airolo, mostly Italians from the poor rural areas of Piedmont and Lombardy. The miners and workers lived in dirty and overcrowded shacks and were financially exploited. A miner earned around 3.90 francs in an eight-hour shift. Two thirds of this wage was deducted for food and accommodation, the lamps and the oil for them - 30 centimes a day - they had to pay for themselves. They were also deducted five francs a month for their clothing and two francs for their residence permit in Switzerland. Part of the earnings were paid out in coupons that could only be redeemed in the company's own shops."
 gaudi.236.g: "No one is forced to work on this project. Everyone is free to go!"
 gaudi.236.h: "We exploit them and pay them with their own money to make them work overtime - a splendid idea!"
 gaudi.236.i: "Ban this unethical business!"
 gaudi.237.t: "Dirty shacks"
 gaudi.237.d: "The misery in the workers' huts at the Gotthard tunnel has grown to such an extent that the railway construction managers are very concerned that a revolt could be imminent."
 gaudi.237.f: "'I found the situation in Göschenen little changed; the Favre apartments are satisfactory, but to an extremely insufficient extent, the private apartments of the citizens are partly good, partly tolerable, partly bad; the workers' barracks, built on speculation and rented out, are as scandalous as before, especially in the large house next to the post office, inhabited by 240 people; there castings ran down the outer walls and they lay in heaps in corridors and in corners; the rooms and their furniture are streaked with dirt, the windows are tightly shut, the air is abominable, actually worse than in most pigsties, which have gates and vents. A water pipe was dutifully built, but in such a way that it froze and ripped, didn't deliver anything all winter and is still out of order, although it hasn't been seriously freezing for weeks.'"
 gaudi.237.g: "To each his own."
 gaudi.237.h: "If they don't like it so badly in their houses - they should work more."
 gaudi.237.i: "These outrageous conditions should be abolished immediately in a civilized country like ours!"
 gaudi.238.t: "Burried alive"
 gaudi.238.d: "A serious accident has happened in the Gotthard tunnel. Several workers were buried under rubble. Their chances of survival are unknown."
 gaudi.238.f: "199 workers died during the construction work on the Gotthard Tunnel. Of the 171 dead mentioned in the accident list in the Federal Archives, 53 workers were crushed by wagons or locomotives, 49 were struck by rocks, and 46 were killed by dynamite. 23 perished in other ways, one of them drowned. According to official statements, the culprit was either chance or the casualty himself. Numerous other men died over the course of the following years as a result of malnutrition, illnesses and injuries sustained during tunnel construction."
 gaudi.238.g: "Unfortunately, that's the risk with this job. Keep digging!"
 gaudi.238.h: "We can not do anything for them. Implement better rules for the future."
 gaudi.238.i: "Do whatever you can to save these poor souls!"
 gaudi.239.t: "New machines in the tunnel"
 gaudi.239.d: "The introduction of new technologies has significantly accelerated our progress in the construction of the Gotthard tunnel."
 gaudi.239.f: "The building contractor Louis Favre took over the first drilling machines of the Sommeiller type from the Mont-Cenis tunnel. To do this, he tested the most important available impact drills on site. The two workshop bosses in Airolo and Göschenen further developed the existing machines: The machines should be less prone to repairs and the impact drills should be equipped with an automatic drive. Seguin and Ferroux, the two workshop managers, were able to make significant progress: at the beginning, three machines had to be replaced every day, towards the end of construction only one machine every three days. At the same time, the exhaust air from the pneumatic percussion drills served to sparingly ventilate the tunnel. Six drilling machines were mounted on carriages. The machines drilled holes about a meter deep, which were then filled with dynamite and blown up."
 gaudi.239.g: "Cheers to progress!"
 gaudi.240.t: "Trade unions criticize Gotthard project"
 gaudi.240.d: "A trade union leader in Parliament today lamented the appalling conditions under which the Gotthard tunnel is being built."
 gaudi.240.f: "Water spills every day, work in a blast furnace heat, miserable housing, exorbitant prices, and a cheap wage of less than 4 francs a day! There are numerous dogs in our country who live better than the hundreds of workers who risk their lives for the profit of a railway company; before being blown to bits by a load of dynamite on an unlucky day. I thought gone were the days when a landowner could push his peasants around like cattle? What is happening in Göschenen and Airolo seems far worse! If something doesn't change urgently, then I promise you that the situation will escalate!'"
 gaudi.240.g: "Doesn't this man understand the importance of our project?"
 gaudi.240.h: "Some reforms may actually be necessary."
 gaudi.241.t: "Escher donates money"
 gaudi.241.d: "Alfred Escher, to whom the construction of the Gotthard railway is a personal concern, used his equity today to advance the construction of the line."
 gaudi.241.f: "Escher not only accompanied the Gotthard project from its inception to its completion; he also personally sacrificed himself for it. It wasn't just about the financial part. He was accused of literally working himself to death for the Gotthard Railway."
 gaudi.241.g: "Thanks, Mr. Escher."
 gaudi.242.t: "Porous rock"
 gaudi.242.d: "An amazingly soft stone has meant that work on the Gotthard tunnel is progressing better than expected."
 gaudi.242.f: "In addition to the many imponderables in the construction of the Gotthard tunnel, which often had rather unpleasant effects, there were always positive surprises."
 gaudi.242.g: "Great!"
 gaudi.243.t: "Impenetrable rock"
 gaudi.243.d: "An astonishingly hard rock has meant that the work on the Gotthard tunnel is progressing less well than expected."
 gaudi.243.f: "The site management was repeatedly confronted with problems in the changing rock. When construction began, the engineers were hardly prepared for the mosaic in the Gotthard massif. It was only over time that these nasty surprises could be avoided. Chief engineer Robert Gerwig commissioned the German mining engineer Friedrich Moritz Stapff to carry out all the necessary geological investigations. First he was assigned to the construction section in Airolo, later he became head of the geological and mining department at the central construction management in Airolo. Stapff's tasks included updating the existing geological maps, observing the geological conditions, such as temperature conditions, water ingress and the condition of the rock, so that construction was not delayed. Stapff recorded all rock formations along the tunnel axis and collected a handpiece for each rock formation."
 gaudi.243.g: "Good things take time."
 gaudi.243.h: "The workers should work overtime!"
 gaudi.243.i: "Get experts from the university to find a long-term solution."
 gaudi.244.t: "Magnificient explosions"
 gaudi.244.d: "One of our national dynamite factories has become the permanent supplier of the Gotthard tunnel construction. The project and the company benefit equally from this."
 gaudi.244.f: "In the course of the construction work, the need for explosives became so great that a separate explosives factory was set up on Lake Lucerne for the tunnel."
 gaudi.244.g: "But that's checked for safety, isn't it?"
 gaudi.245.t: "Worker influx"
 gaudi.245.d: "More and more people are flocking to eastern Switzerland in search of work in the construction of the Gotthard railway."
 gaudi.245.f: "The construction of the Gotthard Railway brought more than 5,000 people to work over a period of almost a decade."
 gaudi.245.g: "Give everyone a shovel, we need every hand."
 gaudi.245.h: "They should settle down for a longer period of time."
 gaudi.246.t: "A new foreign investor"
 gaudi.246.d: "Alfred Escher was able to attract another wealthy foreign investor who can raise fresh capital for the Gotthard project."
 gaudi.246.f: "Over the years, Escher was able to use his contacts again and again in financial emergencies in order to finance the notoriously expensive construction of the Gotthard tunnel - which was also badly needed."
 gaudi.246.g: "We thirst like a wanderer in the desert!"
 gaudi.246.h: "No thanks."
 gaudi.247.t: "STRIKE!"
 gaudi.247.d: "Bad, bad news! The workers on the Gotthard line have walked off the job and are demanding better pay, houses, food and clothing before they pick up their shovels again!"
 gaudi.247.f: "During the construction of the Gotthard tunnel, the population of Göschenen increased several times over. The construction workers lived in precarious conditions. Italian tunnel workers went on strike, demanding more wages and causing an uproar in the village. The trigger was a dispute between a post chief and the miners, who refused to continue drilling until the smoke cleared from the blasts. A war of words then broke out until the miners left the work site in a rage. On the way out, a rumor spread that a box of dynamite was on fire. This caused the rest of the tunnel crew to run outside as well. The workers moved on to the village, where they stopped in front of the post office, where the mayor and postman lived, and vented their anger. Here Luigi Dissune presented the demands of the workers to applause: one franc more wages per day, functioning ventilation and better safety regulations. The threat that no more miners would go into the tunnel until this was completely fulfilled was reinforced by taking up post in front of the tunnel portal so that no miners were allowed into the tunnel at the 10 p.m. shift change."
 gaudi.247.g: "Call the vigilante."
 gaudi.247.h: "We give in to their demands."
 gaudi.248.t: "A sad day for Switzerland"
 gaudi.248.d: "When there was a workers' uprising, our security forces intervened quite brutally. Several workers were killed. We have suffered a loss of international reputation because of this."
 gaudi.248.f: "It is not known why the first shot was fired and by whom it was fired. No order to shoot was given. The exact course of the shooting is also unclear. Afterwards, the demonstrators dispersed. Four of them died and several were injured. Depending on the source, two or three died on the spot, another succumbed to his injuries a day later, and according to the investigation report, the fourth several days later. The event became known throughout Europe through accusatory press reports, also beyond Switzerland. In particular, the background to the formation of the police units involved was questioned."
 gaudi.248.g: "They started it!"
 gaudi.249.t: "Durchstich"
 gaudi.249.d: "After years of extremely difficult efforts, the construction workers met with only a minimal displacement in the middle of the Gotthard massif."
 gaudi.249.f: "After seven years and five months, the construction crews who broke through the mountain massif from the north and south met each other. The deviations were only 33 centimeters laterally and 5 centimeters in height - a masterpiece of engineering and surveying technology at the time. The event was celebrated in the European media, and at 15 kilometers the longest tunnel in the world at the time had been built. 'One can say today that the entire press on the continent pays homage to the Gotthardwerk and pays the tribute of sincere recognition,' wrote the Zurich Landbote at the time."
 gaudi.249.g: "Champagne!"

 gaudi.301.t: "Construction of Cristo Redentor begins"
 gaudi.301.d: "With the construction of the first scaffolding and iron structures on the Corcovado, the construction workers have started to work on the statue of Christ."
 gaudi.301.f: "Christ the Redeemer is the largest statue in the world built in Art Deco style. The face of the statue was created by the sculptor Gheorghe Leonida who was born in Galati, Romania in 1893. He studied sculpture at the Bucharest Conservatory of Fine Arts and then, after studying in Italy for another three years, won the Reveil Sculpture Prize. Famed in France as a portraitist, he was recruited by Paul Landowski into the team that began work on Christ the Redeemer in 1922. Gheorghe Leonida contributed by depicting the face of Jesus Christ on the statue, a fact that made him famous. A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's presentations and made the decision to build the structure out of reinforced concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) rather than steel, which would be more appropriate for a cruciform statue. The outer layers are made of soapstone, chosen for its durability and ease of use. It took nine years to build and cost the equivalent of $250,000 (or $3.3 million in 2014 value)."
 gaudi.301.g: "An important step for our nation."
 gaudi.302.t: "Christ on Corcovado mountain"
 gaudi.302.d: "After years of construction work, a highlight of Art Deco architecture was completed today with the statue of Christ - and one of the new symbols of Brazil!"
 gaudi.302.f: "During the unveiling ceremony, the statue was illuminated by a series of floodlights triggered remotely by shortwave radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi, who was 9,200 kilometers away in Rome, Italy, but due to inclement weather the lights were switched on on site. A mass was also held at the inauguration. Cristo Rednetor was the tallest statue of Christ in the world from 1931 to 1981."
 gaudi.302.g: "May he protect country and city."
 gaudi.309.t: "Rio lost"
 gaudi.309.d: "With the loss of Rio de Janeiro, we lost every opportunity to continue building Cristo Redentor."
 gaudi.309.f: "If we lose Rio de Janeiro, we'll have to start construction all over again to retake it. Only a country with Brazilian culture can complete Cristo Redentor."
 gaudi.309.g: "We can't leave Rio de Janeiro to them for long!"

 gaudi.311.t: "Good progress"
 gaudi.311.d: "The work on Cristo Redentor is progressing better than expected. We expect to be a few months ahead of schedule."
 gaudi.311.f: "Modern technology, fast work processes, material supplies without interruption and good weather favor the construction progress."
 gaudi.311.g: "News that sweeten the day."
 gaudi.312.t: "A Donation for Cristo Redentor"
 gaudi.312.d: "As a good christian, [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_cristo_donator').GetFullName] has a great personal interest in Cristo Redentor. He therefore submitted a personal donation for the construction of the statue."
 gaudi.312.f: "The erection of the statue of Christ was a suggestion that had been circulating for decades before it was realized and was a major concern, especially in devout Catholic circles. Numerous donors supported the project when it was finally tackled."
 gaudi.312.g: "We are in his debt."
 gaudi.313.t: "The clergy welcomes our building project"
 gaudi.313.d: "Brazil's clergy are ready to do everything in their power to complete Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer statue. Church-critical forces fear that our government will be influenced too much by the church."
 gaudi.313.f: "Funding problems delayed the construction of the Cristo Rednetor for almost ten years before the inauguration could finally take place with the support of the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, the Holy See and France."
 gaudi.313.g: "We should benefit from that."
 gaudi.313.h: "Praise the Church in public."
 gaudi.313.i: "This matter does not involve the church!"
 gaudi.314.t: "Trade unions are critical of Cristo Redentor"
 gaudi.314.d: "As a representative of the trade unions, [SCOPE.sCharacter('trade_unions_leader').GetFullName] sent a petition to the government today to reconsider the controversial support of Cristo Redentor."
 gaudi.314.f: "The trade union leaders in Brazil see the current construction of Christ the Redeemer as a horrendous waste of money. If they can't prevent construction even to divert the funds to meaningful charitable channels, they at least demand better treatment and care for the builders who work at dangerous heights and have to haul tons of material up the mountain."
 gaudi.314.g: "Ignore them."
 gaudi.314.h: "Pay lip service."
 gaudi.314.i: "Spend money to improve the worker's situation."
 gaudi.315.t: "Transportation problems"
 gaudi.315.d: "Corcovado Mountain is certainly an ideal spot to build a landmark that can be seen for miles. Logistically, however, it has its disadvantages."
 gaudi.315.f: "Corcovado, which means 'hump' in Portuguese, is a 710 meter high mountain in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro with a nearly vertical drop on one side. Although a railway line opened up the mountain at the end of the 19th century, the transport of larger components in particular turned out to be more difficult than initially thought, especially due to the winding and narrow path up to the mountain top."
 gaudi.315.g: "All I hear are only complaints!"
 gaudi.316.t: "Accident"
 gaudi.316.d: "An accident happened today at the Christ the Redeemer construction site, which has set construction work back by weeks."
 gaudi.316.f: "Despite the great height, the construction of the statue of Christ was less dangerous than the construction of many a skyscraper. However, accidents could not be ruled out. Even the site manager Heitor Levy almost fell off a scaffolding into the abyss. Levy was saved by the construction workers at the last moment and attributed this miracle to an intervention by Jesus Christ himself. Due to this near-death experience, the native Jew later converted to Catholicism."
 gaudi.316.g: "An omen?"
 gaudi.317.t: "Thunderstorm"
 gaudi.317.d: "During a thunderstorm, lightning struck Christ the Redeemer, destroying parts of it."
 gaudi.317.f: "Thunderstorms were a constant problem during construction and even after the statue was completed. Lightning strikes repeatedly destroyed parts of the soap stone and also destroyed some larger parts such as fingers."
 gaudi.317.g: "An unfortunate incident."
 gaudi.317.h: "Repair the damages."
 gaudi.317.i: "We need more lightning rods."
 gaudi.317.j: "Repair the damage and build new lightning rods."
 gaudi.318.t: "A praise"
 gaudi.318.d: "A member of parliament from [SCOPE.sCountry('gaudi_cristo_neighbour').GetName] visited Rio de Janeiro today and expressed his delight at the Christ the Redeemer statue, which is taking shape every day."
 gaudi.318.f: "The statue of Christ has already become a national symbol of Brazil and outshines all of Latin America."
 gaudi.318.g: "Thank you."
 gaudi.318.h: "Get him to collect support in his country for our project."
 gaudi.319.t: "Atheistic intervention"
 gaudi.319.d: "In a public speech today, [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_cristo_atheist').GetFullName] castigated the construction of the statue of Christ as a return to the Middle Ages and called on like-minded people to denounce the waste of money."
 gaudi.319.f: "'If God wanted a statue of himself, why didn't he say so? And if he needs one, why not build it himself? Brazil is a modern country that needs no gods or kings, only man. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? I believe in no God, no invisible man in the sky. Why worship a flag or a God, when we can worship that which is best in us: our will to be great?"
 gaudi.319.g: "We should not challenge this group too much."
 gaudi.319.h: "DEUS VULT!"
 gaudi.319.i: "Art Deco and words like that. I have a VERY bad feeling about this guy."
 gaudi.320.t: "Touristic investments"
 gaudi.320.d: "The tourism industry sees the statue of Christ as a positive factor and would like to support the project."
 gaudi.320.f: "The construction of the Christ the Redeemer coincided with a time when Rio de Janeiro was becoming a fashionable travel destination due to the networking in air traffic, its sandy beach and the lively cultural scene. The modern statue on the Corcovado was thus also a symbol for the emerging tourism industry and a welcome addition as a new attraction."
 gaudi.320.g: "Beach, sun, hotels and Christ the Redeemer!"

 gaudi.401.t: "Construction of Mole Antonelliana resumed"
 gaudi.401.d: "After the city of Turin completed the last negotiations with the Jewish community, the construction work started again today."
 gaudi.401.f: "Originally, the Jewish community in Turin wanted to set up an opulent seat in the former capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. The new synagogue was designed to demonstrate the presence, advancement, and integration of the city's Jewish citizens. The nominated architect Alessandro Antonelli was to take on the job. However, Antonelli was also known for his monumental buildings, the dimensions of which he expanded. In the Piedmontese town of Castellamonte, for example, Antonelli had planned a cathedral that would have rivaled that of St. Peter's in Rome; but the mammoth project remained unfinished because of the lack of financing. A similar fate now threatened the Jewish community with its new synagogue, which grew sky-high by the day, but threatened to become a financial disaster for the Jewish community. The Turin city authorities bought the building and compensated the Jews with new land and a new synagogue, which was built in a few years. Instead, the "Mole" should become a national symbol of Italy."
 gaudi.401.g: "Hopefully Antonelli doesn't change his plans again..."
 gaudi.402.t: "Mole Antonelliana: First Phase finished"
 gaudi.402.d: "The basic structures of the Mole Antonelliana are complete. However, regarding the roof and the spire, Antonelli has new eccentric ideas.."
 gaudi.402.f: "The Mole Antonelliana was originally intended to have an ordinary dome. However, Antonelli built it ever more voluminous and taller, until the result was the characteristic form with which it is associated today. This also meant that finishing construction at the top would take extra time."
 gaudi.402.g: "Is this man never satisfied?"
 gaudi.403.t: "Reaching the sky with Antonelli"
 gaudi.403.d: "The final construction phase of the Mole Antonelliana has begun."
 gaudi.403.f: "As per his initial project, Antonelli decided to finish the Mole with an almost pointed termination, provided with colonnades between the neo-Gothic and the neo-classical, thus imitating another of his previous works, the tip of the Basilica of San Gaudenzio, symbol of Novara. From 90 meters upwards he therefore broke with the square-based architectural theme, designing a granite colonnade with a circular base, called the 'Lantern', placed on a truncated cone base. Likewise, the architect also conceived the design of a spire of about 50 meters above the Lantern, with an octagonal section, and interspersed with ten circular terraces, the first two still equipped with a colonnade, then upwards gradually more and more small, and accessible by a small zig-zag ladder."
 gaudi.403.g: "And I hoped it was just finishing touches and decorations..."
 gaudi.404.t: "Mole Antonelliana completed"
 gaudi.404.d: "The construction work was ceremoniously completed today with the installation of a genie. Turin and Italy are richer by a landmark!"
 gaudi.404.f: "Antonelli worked with dedication on the Mole until his death; the rudimentary lift operated by a pulley that carried the nearly ninety-year-old architect to several tens of meters in height, to personally check the state of the works, became legendary. A few months after his death, the architect suggested finishing the spire with a statue depicting a 'Winged Genius'. The design of the statue was commissioned to the sculptor Fumagalli; the Genius, made of embossed and gilded copper, weighed about 300 kg, and had a spear in one hand and a palm branch in the other. The statue reached a total height of 5.46 meters. After Antonelli's death, the completion of the spire was overseen above all by his son Costanzo and his pupil Crescentino Caselli. With the final laying of the 'Winged Genius', the building reached an overall height of 167.35 metres, a height, at the time, never reached by any masonry construction in Europe and the world. The Mole, the tallest masonry construction in the world, entered into direct 'competition' with the Eiffel Tower in Paris, inaugurated just 10 days earlier and which would have been the tallest building in the world until 1930."
 gaudi.404.g: "Viva Torino, viva l'Italia!"
 gaudi.409.t: "Turin lost!"
 gaudi.409.d: "With the loss of Piedmont, we lost every opportunity to continue building the Mole Antonelliana."
 gaudi.409.f: "Should Piedmont be lost for any reason, the construction progress will not be lost as a whole. Only Italy can continue building the Mole Antonelliana at the last construction phase. Foreign invaders, on the other hand, will show no interest in further construction."
 gaudi.409.g: "We can't leave Turin to them for long!"

 gaudi.411.t: "Bad bricks"
 gaudi.411.d: "The last delivery of material for the Mole Antonelliana turned out to be poor."
 gaudi.411.f: "For a moment, the usual activity at the Turin construction site, where the Mole Antonelliana grew taller every day, died down. A brief inventory by Antonelli revealed that the bricks were not of the usual quality and has announced that he would prefer to wait before his masterpiece could be jeopardized by these bricks. However, there are voices in the construction management that the bricks should still be used - not only because the construction could be delayed, but also because there are fears that Antonelli could use the time to change the plan again ..."
 gaudi.412.t: "Disaster!"
 gaudi.412.d: "The inferior material has taken its toll: this morning a section of the Mole Antonelliana collapsed and caused considerable damage."
 gaudi.412.f: "Perhaps Antonelli should have been listened to. Perhaps it really wasn't a good idea to use crumbling bricks for a monument as important as the Mole Antonelliana. Perhaps one should therefore have thought twice about this decision. But too late - the substandard material took its toll today, leading to the collapse of a wall and destroying large parts of the construction progress of the last few weeks and months when a facade collapsed."
 gaudi.413.t: "Archaeological investigations in Turin"
 gaudi.413.d: "After a visit to Turin, [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_archaeologist').GetFullName] discovered that the Mole Antonelliana apparently stands on Roman ruins. He asks for an excavation license."
 gaudi.413.f: "In the first century BC, the Romans founded Augusta Taurinorum. Via Garibaldi traces the exact path of the Roman city's decumanus which began at the Porta Decumani, later incorporated into the Castello or Palazzo Madama. The Porta Palatina, on the north side of the current city centre, is still preserved in a park near the cathedral. Remains of the Roman-period theatre are preserved in the area of the Manica Nuova."
 gaudi.414.t: "A new machine"
 gaudi.414.d: "The motor industry of our country has recently equipped the construction site of the Mole Antonelliana with a highly modern machine that is driving the work forward."
 gaudi.414.f: "The Mole Antonelliana is best known for being one of the largest brick structures of its time, following traditional rather than progressive architectural theories in many respects. But even though the building didn't use steel structures or cement, that didn't preclude the use of other machinery. Turin, along with Milan and Genoa, was one of the major industrial locations in Italy, which made it possible to deliver machines that made work easier if Master Antonelli ordered them."
 gaudi.415.t: "Citizen Donation"
 gaudi.415.d: "Representatives of the patriotically minded petty bourgeoisie, under their leader [SCOPE.sCharacter('pb_leader').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('pb_leader').GetFullName], made a donation to the construction of the Mole Antonelliana."
 gaudi.415.f: "Since it was taken over by the municipal authorities, the Mole Antonelliana had become more than just a symbol for the up-and-coming industrial location of Turin. The greatness striving for heaven was not only a symbol of modernity, but also of the national spirit of Italy. For the patriotically minded bourgeoisie, the building was a symbol of identification for the new state. When completed, the building would house the Museum of the Risorgimento. Nationally minded Italians therefore had a great interest in speedy completion."
 gaudi.415.g: "We owe them a debt of gratitude."
 gaudi.416.t: "Antonelli just had another idea ..."
 gaudi.416.d: "Alessandro Antonelli, the builder of the monument named after him, has recently surprised the construction management with a change..."
 gaudi.416.f: "It would be an understatement to dismiss Alessandro Antonelli as an eccentric architect. It is a perfectly natural thing to plan a building 130 meters high and then insist that a height of no less than 160 meters is beneath the dignity of an architect because of one's own demands for perfection. It is also a matter of course to plan a church building in the Piedmont province in the dimensions of St. Peter's in Rome. And it is certainly not a sign of slight megalomania that a considerable number of his buildings are never completed because they do not meet one's own requirements. None of that would suit Alessandro Antonelli. Be that as it may, he has a new idea to prolong the construction of the Mole Antonelliana again..."
 gaudi.416.g: "Mamma mia!"
 gaudi.416.h: "Santo Dio!"
 gaudi.416.i: "Porca miseria!"
 gaudi.416.j: "Cavolo!"
 gaudi.417.t: "The Antoniella grows skyward"
 gaudi.417.d: "The construction of the Mole Antonelliana is progressing faster than expected for reasons that are not specified."
 gaudi.417.f: "For reasons unknown, the construction of the majestic Mole Antonelliana is progressing. Maybe it was the good weather. Possibly the prayer to the Madonna. Possibly also the rather inferior building material that we squandered the other day and that we hope will never be found. One thing is certain: this monster, which has repeatedly experienced delays due to the most varied of circumstances, should be finished faster than expected. Assuming Antonelli doesn't use this to try and make up for the time savings with a new expansion..."
 gaudi.418.t: "Falling beam destroys brick wall"
 gaudi.418.d: "A falling support beam caused considerable damage to the Mole Antonelliana today and set construction back."
 gaudi.418.f: "This support beam wasn't really supporting."
 gaudi.418.g: "Aggravating."
 gaudi.419.t: "The Monarch makes a visit"
 gaudi.419.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetFullName] has decided to pay a personal visit to the Molle Antonelliana construction site."
 gaudi.419.f: "Our monarch [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetFullName] has already shown a great deal of interest in what is happening on the Turin construction site in the past and now intends to visit the site. The preparations are in full swing - and of course they want to offer something to His Majesty! Simple construction workers, the construction management and Antonelli personally have therefore set a previously unknown chord speed after the announcement."
 gaudi.419.g: "His Majesty knows how to motivate."
 gaudi.420.t: "Construction site accident"
 gaudi.420.d: "Several men were injured in an accident today. The construction management of the Mole Antonelliana assumes that there will be major delays if we do not repair the damage and recruit replacement staff."
 gaudi.420.f: "Several men were injured in an accident in Turin today, some of them seriously - they had to be taken to the hospital. Among the injured are experienced skilled workers who played a key role in the construction. Without them, construction is likely to be delayed until she recovers."
 gaudi.420.g: "Accidents happen."
 gaudi.420.h: "We should do everything we can to ensure that this does not disrupt the construction progress."
 gaudi.421.t: "Threat of strike"
 gaudi.421.d: "The construction workers of the Mole Antonelliana have announced a strike if we don't want to negotiate better pay."
 gaudi.421.f: "Ah, the wonderful world of strikes! You don't know what you're missing out on if you haven't experienced in Italy what it's like to be stranded at a train station because the railway workers' union suddenly decides to sabotage it. Today it affects only one construction site. We're really lucky!"
 gaudi.421.g: "We will not negotiate."
 gaudi.421.h: "Paying some scabs will do the job."
 gaudi.421.i: "Call the Carabinieri!"
 gaudi.421.j: "Negotiate."
 gaudi.422.t: "Thunderstorm destroys Spire"
 gaudi.422.d: "A thunderstorm became a tornado-like phenomenon and ripped off the spire of the Mole Antonelliana during the night!"
 gaudi.422.f: "A violent storm, probably a whirlwind, caused 47 meters of the spire to break and fall into a small garden. The spire, brushing against the window of a room on the top floor, partially destroyed a balcony, but caused no harm to people. A similar fate happened to the Mole on 23 May 1953. The Mole with the broken spire can be seen at the end of the opening credits of the 1955 film The Friends by Michelangelo Antonioni. The title of tallest masonry building in Europe therefore passed to the bell tower of the Cathedral of Ulm, Germany (161.53 meters), while Philadelphia City Hall passed the title of tallest masonry building in the world (162.53 metres). This was also due to the fact that the spire would no longer be rebuilt in masonry, but in reinforced concrete."
 gaudi.422.g: "A disaster!"
 gaudi.423.t: "Nietzsche admires the Mole"
 gaudi.423.d: "The famous German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche spent much of the 1870s and 1880s in Turin, which he held in high esteem. He praised the Mole Antonelliana as one of the greatest buildings of his time."
 gaudi.423.f: "'I passed by the Mole Antonelliana, the most ingenious building which was perhaps built for an absolute upward impulse - it recalls nothing but Zarathustra. I baptized it Ecce Homo and surrounded it in my spirit with an immense free space.' - Friedrich Nietzsche"
 gaudi.423.g: "The man has taste. Not just since 'Morgenröte'."

 gaudi.501.t: "Construction work begins on the Ringstrasse"
 gaudi.501.d: "With a decree, [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetFullName] initiated the start of construction of the ring road today."
 gaudi.501.f: "'It is my will that the expansion of the inner city of Vienna be tackled as soon as possible with a view to connecting it with the suburbs and that the regulation and beautification of my residence and imperial capital be taken into account. To this end I authorize the abandonment of the wall and fortifications of the inner city, as well as the ditches around it. That part of the area and glacis grounds obtained by abandoning the wall around the fortifications and city moats, which is not reserved for another determination in accordance with the basic plan to be drafted, is to be used as building ground and the proceeds gained from this are to be used to form a building fund, From which the expenses incurred by the state treasury as a result of this measure, in particular also the costs of the construction of public buildings, as well as the relocation of the military institutions that are still necessary, are to be met.' - Franz Joseph I."
 gaudi.501.g: "Vienna will become a metropolis of the first rank."
 gaudi.502.t: "Inauguration of the Ringstrasse"
 gaudi.502.d: "The Ringstrasse was inaugurated with a ceremony today. But that only applies to the avenue as such - this place still lacks the greatness that is supposed to put Vienna on a par with London and Paris."
 gaudi.502.f: "'Your Majesty brought the most beautiful Christmas gift to the entire population of your faithful residence city through the generous decision that the walls of Vienna should fall and the city should be expanded, because Vienna should become one of the most beautiful and healthy cities in Europe. The greater part of the task set by Your Majesty has been accomplished, the confining curtain walls have disappeared, a street with the most beautiful palaces and houses has been completed, gardens and grounds have been created which adorn the residence and provide relaxation for the residents. The long-awaited aqueduct, which is the condition for the cleanliness of the city and for the health of its inhabitants, will crown the great work of city expansion, and Your Majesty as the founder of the same will owe even the coming generations the deepest thanks. Permit Your Majesty that I express my most respectful thanks on behalf of the representatives of the City of Vienna, that they have the grace to open the Ringstrasse today.' - Andreas Zelinka, Mayor of Vienna"
 gaudi.502.g: "Vienna, you are a gem!"
 gaudi.503.t: "A turning point for Vienna"
 gaudi.503.d: "The ring road is slowly taking shape. In particular, the construction of a large opera house and a new town hall will underpin the caesura that this construction phase means for Vienna's city history."
 gaudi.503.f: "'I regard the completion of the ring road as a particularly important stage in the work of urban expansion. I have always devoted my special attention to this matter and express my appreciation and gratitude to you, Mr. Mayor, and to the municipal council for the special care you have given to the beautification of my residence. In the future I will continue to pay attention to the further progress in the expansion of the city and, as far as possible, take into account the wishes of the municipality in relation to obtaining building plots for the construction of schools, warehouses and parks at very reasonable prices. In order to bring one of the most important questions to a speedy solution, I have made the order that the municipality be allowed to carry out the water supply of the Kaiserbrunnen free of charge, and I hope that the water supply will thus come to a speedy and happy conclusion.' - Franz Joseph I."
 gaudi.504.t: "Splendour of Vienna"
 gaudi.504.d: "With the inauguration of the new State Opera and the move into the New Town Hall, an important step has been taken towards making Vienna a truly worthy capital of Austria."
 gaudi.504.f: "'The streets of Vienna are paved with culture. The streets of other cities with asphalt.' - Karl Kraus"
 gaudi.505.t: "On the Road to Greatness"
 gaudi.505.d: "With the planning for the university, parliament and art museums, the construction of the Vienna Ringstrasse is entering its final phase. The task now is to create an architectural wonder out of an aesthetically pleasing district."
 gaudi.505.f: "'Vienna has a lot of landmarks and every Viennese feels like one.' - Karl Kraus"
 gaudi.506.t: "Vienna Ringstrasse completed"
 gaudi.506.d: "As of today, the Ringstrasse has gained its defining appearance. Although it cannot be ruled out that further extensions could follow in the future, what will go down in history as the 'ring house style' has reached its zenith here and now. The whole of Europe envies us for this scenery!"
 gaudi.506.f: "'Es war sehr schön, es hat mich sehr gefreut.' - Franz Joseph I."
 gaudi.506.g: "It was very nice, it was truly my pleasure."
 gaudi.509.t: "Vienna lost!"
 gaudi.509.d: "With the loss of Vienna, we lost every opportunity to continue building the Vienna Ringstrasse."
 gaudi.509.f: "Should Vienna be lost for any reason, the construction progress will not be lost as a whole. Only Austria can continue building the Vienna Ringstrasse at the last construction phase. Foreign invaders, on the other hand, will show no interest in further construction."
 gaudi.509.g: "We can't leave Vienna to them for long!"

 gaudi.511.t: "Fountain or Pavillon?"
 gaudi.511.d: "When it came to beautifying the ring road, there was a disagreement in urban planning."
 gaudi.511.f: "One could mistake it for a quarrel about the emperor's beard: a tangible political dispute has developed from a petitesse. It is a construction project on a representative square of high aesthetic value. One faction would like to build a pavilion there to linger, the other advocates the construction of a fountain. Since there is only one plot, only one of the projects can be built; a compromise is unfeasible."
 gaudi.511.g: "We build the pavillon."
 gaudi.511.h: "We build the fountain."
 gaudi.511.i: "I have my own plans for this place..."
 gaudi.512.t: "Statues on the Ringstrasse"
 gaudi.512.d: "A new group of figures is to be erected on Vienna's Ringstrasse, but it is unclear which mythological figure will have a special place."
 gaudi.512.f: "When planning the ring road, a few details are still unclear. It has not yet been determined which figures are to be placed in a prominent position. It is clear that these should be figures from the Roman pantheon. Certain sections of the population identify with the respective figures - for example, the capitalists have suggested placing Mercury, the god of commerce, in the middle. The aristocrats, on the other hand, insist on Jupiter, the father of the gods. The military prefers Mars, the academics want Apollo at the center."
 gaudi.512.g: "Jupiter."
 gaudi.512.h: "Mercury."
 gaudi.512.i: "Apollo."
 gaudi.512.j: "Mars."
 gaudi.513.t: "Ministry building exceeds cost"
 gaudi.513.d: "The construction of a new ministry building is turning into a minor scandal."
 gaudi.513.f: "A new ministry was to be built on Ringstrasse as the flagship of government, however constant changes of plan, expansion and latent corruption have meant that construction of the building has dragged on and all funds have been used up to completion. The unfinished building could be brought into a functional state with a few temporary measures, but this is probably not in the interests of the government, which would have to be content with smaller offices and less comfort than expected. Further construction is possible, but it will probably be expensive - and delay the construction of the ring road."
 gaudi.513.g: "There was a budget and this budget must be adhered to."
 gaudi.513.h: "This is unfortunate, but common in this field."
 gaudi.513.i: "This project should get as much money and time as it needs."
 gaudi.514.t: "New Coffee house"
 gaudi.514.d: "A new coffee house has opened on the Ringstrasse."
 gaudi.514.f: "'The coffee house remained our best place of education for everything new. In order to understand this, one must know that the Viennese coffee house is an institution of a special kind that cannot be compared with any similar institution in the world. It is actually a kind of democratic club, accessible to everyone for a cheap cup of coffee, where for this small fee every guest can sit for hours, discuss, write, play cards, receive their mail and, above all, consume an unlimited number of newspapers and magazines. All the Viennese newspapers were available in a better Viennese coffee house, and not just the Viennese ones, but those of the entire German Reich, French, English, Italian, and American, as well as all the important literary and artistic reviews in the world. So we knew everything that was going on in the world first hand, we heard about every book that was published, about every performance, wherever it was taking place, and compared the reviews in all the newspapers. Perhaps nothing contributed so much to the intellectual flexibility and international orientation of the Austrian as the fact that he was able to orientate himself so comprehensively about all events in the world in the coffee house and at the same time discuss them in friendly circles. We sat there for hours every day, and we didn't miss a thing.' - Stefan Zweig"

 gaudi.515.t: "Ringstrasse-Palais"
 gaudi.515.d: "A nobleman overreached himself building a palace on the Ringstrasse. The half-finished building ruin threatens to become an eyesore."
 gaudi.515.f: "Ringstrasse Palace is the term for magnificent palaces on Vienna's Ringstrasse. These buildings were mostly built by the old nobility or by bankers and industrialists in the late 19th century. The palaces were built in the Ringstrasse style, a mixture of Neo-Baroque and Neo-Renaissance, or Neo-Mannerism. They were also a symbol of rise and status. However, one of the builders has recently overstretched and is facing bankruptcy. The Viennese are already scoffing at the eyesore on the Ringstrasse, which in the worst case would have to be demolished again, thus extending the completion of the entire project."
 gaudi.515.g: "We share the costs."
 gaudi.515.h: "That's none of our business."
 gaudi.516.t: "Vienna Ringstrasse: Good progress"
 gaudi.516.d: "The construction of the ring road is progressing surprisingly quickly. According to the current status, the current construction phase could be completed earlier."
 gaudi.516.f: "For unknown reasons, the construction of the ring road is progressing better: may it be love for the fatherland, high wages, friendly support from the local elites or simply the better weather."
 gaudi.516.g: "Marvelous."
 gaudi.517.t: "Vienna Ringstrasse: Slow progress"
 gaudi.517.d: "Unfortunately, the Viennese construction management had to admit today that the construction of the ring road is behind schedule and is taking longer than expected."
 gaudi.517.f: "For reasons unknown, construction of the ring road is progressing more slowly: whether it be agitation by hostile political elements, undermining of work ethic by unions, an Illuminati conspiracy, or simply bad weather."
 gaudi.517.g: "Regrettable."

 gaudi.518.d: "A new monument is to be planned for the Ringstrasse: it is a statue of our King [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
 gaudi.518.f: "The Ringstrasse served to illustrate Austrian history. On the one hand, the long line of monarchs from the Habsburg ruling family was immortalized, of which Maria Theresa received the most opulent monument. But also generals like Eugen von Savoyen or Schwarzberg enriched the Viennese cityscape. The bourgeoisie, meanwhile, attached great importance to immortalising their exponents, namely the poet princes Goethe and Schiller, but also the great composers Schubert, Mozart an Beethoven."

 gaudi.518.h: "Lovely - but focus on completing the Ringstrasse instead."
 gaudi.519.t: "Fire!"
 gaudi.519.d: "A devastating fire destroyed several buildings on Ringstrasse."
 gaudi.519.f: "The best-known catastrophe on the ring road was the Ringtheater fire on December 8, 1881. It is one of the biggest fire catastrophes of the 19th century. Estimates range from hundreds if not more than a thousand victims. The cause was a fault in the gas lighting, which resulted in the gas escaping and exploding the next time it was tried to ignite. The resulting fire spread to the backdrop trains before rapidly spreading to the rest of the stage and eventually the auditorium. The fire had domestic and international effects on preventive fire protection, especially in the theater area and the corresponding legal provisions for theater construction in Austria. The composer Anton Bruckner, who had tickets for the evening's performance, only escaped death by staying at home because he was unwell."
 gaudi.519.g: "A terrible day for all of Austria."
 gaudi.520.t: "Prejudices against the Ringstrasse"
 gaudi.520.d: "The representatives of the rural population see the preference for the capital Vienna and in particular the magnificent development of the city of Vienna as a disadvantage for the common rural population."
 gaudi.520.f: "'The government makes it clear with its unspeakable swagger in the capital that it consists of aloof city dwellers who only think a few streets away and have never left Vienna. Enormous sums are squandered there, which only come to the capital Vienna, but which the common country people in the small towns or villages don't notice anything about. The ideology behind it favors centralism, favors bureaucracy, favors and assists the state apparatus; but what perspective does such a decadent project offer to the common man?'"
 gaudi.520.g: "How about a friendly gift for the benefit of the hard-working rural population?"
 gaudi.520.h: "City and province are equal."
 gaudi.520.i: "Who cares about this stupid farmer's talk?"
 gaudi.521.t: "Industrialist Residence"
 gaudi.521.d: "A wealthy businessman had a new palace built and thus enriched the Vienna Ringstrasse with a great building."
 gaudi.521.f: "The Ringstrasse palaces (Ringstraßenpalais) of Austrian industrialists and bankers were seen as a way of emphasizing their new position in the state. It was also possible for the wealthy of Jewish origin to emphasize their emancipation. One of the most famous ring road palaces is the Palais Epstein. It was built for the industrialist and banker Gustav Ritter von Epstein. The architect was Theophil Freiherr von Hansen, who also designed the adjacent Austrian Parliament Building. It is up to five storeys high and built in the neo-renaissance style typical of its time."
 gaudi.521.g: "The Ringstrasse is growing and thriving."
 gaudi.522.t: "Extending the Barracks"
 gaudi.522.d: "The Ringstrasse project offers the opportunity to modernize and expand the barracks."
 gaudi.522.f: "The Franz-Josephs-Barracks was a Viennese barracks building in today's Ringstrasse area and for a long time an obstacle to the construction of the large-scale project. The barracks were named after Emperor Franz Joseph I and built in 1854-1857 in the wake of the 1848 revolution. Shortly after its construction, the barracks stood in the way of the development of the Vienna Ringstrasse, which began in 1857, but it took four decades for the army to move out of here again. New barracks therefore had to be erected beforehand in order to absorb the loss of the Franz Joseph barracks."
 gaudi.522.g: "Expand the barracks."
 gaudi.522.h: "Let's better invest the time elsewhere."
 gaudi.523.t: "Extending the Construction sector"

 gaudi.523.g: "Expand the construction office."
 gaudi.524.t: "Stadtpark"
 gaudi.524.d: "Vienna's Stadtpark is complete and is now open to all citizens for walks."
 gaudi.524.f: "The water glacis in front of the Karolinenstadt gate was a popular place of entertainment as early as the Biedermeier period. In the course of the demolition of Vienna's city wall, the city wall was redesigned into the Vienna Ringstrasse, and the then Mayor of Vienna, Andreas Zelinka, supported the project for a public park on this site. This park was planned in the style of English landscape parks by the landscape painter Joseph Sellény. At the water glacis there was a spa pavilion where medicinal water was served for drinking cures. Accordingly, the Kursalon was built for the city park according to plans by Johann Garben. The magnificent building in the style of the Italian Renaissance is located on Johannesgasse and has a wide terrace in the park. At the time of the Strauss brothers, the Kursalon was a popular place for dancing and concerts."
 gaudi.524.g: "Let's have a walk."
 gaudi.524.h: "Let's celebrate with a concert in the Kursalon!"
 gaudi.525.t: "Extending the Opera"
 gaudi.525.d: "The ring road project offers the opportunity to modernize and expand the opera."
 gaudi.525.f: "The Vienna State Opera, the 'First House on the Ring', is one of the most famous opera houses in the world. As a cultural institution, the Vienna State Opera is the successor to the Vienna Court Opera, which was founded and promoted by the Habsburgs. In addition, the Vienna State Opera Orchestra continues the tradition of the Vienna Court Orchestra, which has been in use since 1498. In 1860, the new building for the Court Opera was tendered as the first monumental building on the Ringstrasse to be financed from Vienna's city expansion fund. Numerous architects took part in the architectural competition. The construction was based on plans by the architects August Sicard von Sicardsburg and Eduard van der Nüll in neo-Renaissance style. The building was not well appreciated by the public. On the one hand, compared to the huge Heinrichshof, a private apartment building, it could not develop a real monumental effect. Mockery and criticism eventually drove van der Nüll to commit suicide. Since Emperor Franz Joseph had also criticized the architect, he was shocked. From then on he is said to have commented on all new art phenomena only with the stereotypical phrase 'It was very nice, it was truly my pleasure'."
 gaudi.525.g: "Expand the opera house."
 gaudi.526.t: "Extending the Town Hall"
 gaudi.526.d: "The ring road project offers the opportunity to modernize and expand the Town Hall."
 gaudi.526.f: "The Vienna City Hall is one of many historicist buildings that were built along the Ringstrasse at this time. The town hall facade is an outstanding example of a neo-Gothic secular building. The exterior, particularly the 98 m high tower, is inspired by the tradition of Flemish Gothic town halls, such as the Brussels Town Hall on the Grand-Place/Grote Markt, to tie in externally with the medieval tradition of urban freedom. The floor plan with seven courtyards follows the conception of baroque palaces."
 gaudi.526.g: "Expand the town hall."
 gaudi.527.t: "Heldenplatz"
 gaudi.527.d: "After the completion of the Heldenplatz (Heroes' Square), some leading political figures are pushing for a befitting inauguration."
 gaudi.527.f: "When the Ringstrasse was built, the 'outer Burgplatz' was designed under Emperor Franz Joseph as part of the Kaiserforum, which was never completed. The plan was to create a rectangular square that would be framed by the Leopoldine Wing, the New Hofburg, the Habsburg Collections and by a counterpart of the New Castle that was never built on the site of the Volksgarten. The name Heldenplatz was fixed in 1878; it comes from the two equestrian monuments, both of which are by Anton Dominik Fernkorn. The older one is Archduke Karl's, which was unveiled in 1860. The counterpart, the equestrian statue of Prince Eugene, was also completed in 1865. After the loss of World War I, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy under the rule of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty and the founding of the first Austrian republic, Heldenplatz served as a rallying point for all political camps and as a parade ground for the Austrian army."
 gaudi.527.g: "Hold a parade and invite our friends."
 gaudi.527.h: "Establish a permanent military parade for the next few years."
 gaudi.527.i: "And who should pay for all this?"
 gaudi.528.t: "Extending the University"
 gaudi.528.d: "The ring road project offers the opportunity to modernize and expand the university."
 gaudi.528.f: "As a homage to the first heyday of science in Europe, Heinrich Ferstel chose the style of the Italian High Renaissance for the main building of the University of Vienna, with the universities of Padua and Genoa serving as inspiration. The building complex has a large arcaded courtyard and eight smaller courtyards. The striking protruding columned hall is the eye-catcher on the Ringstrasse. In the pediment, a relief depicts the birth of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom. It is the central building of the University of Vienna, which was founded in 1365."
 gaudi.528.g: "Expand the university."
 gaudi.529.t: "Extending the Art Academy"
 gaudi.529.d: "The ring road project offers the opportunity to modernize and expand the art academy."
 gaudi.529.f: "The Vienna Art Academy was founded in 1692 as a private academy by court chamber painter Peter Strudel based on the model of the Accademia di San Luca, for which he provided rooms in the Strudelhof that he had built. This makes it one of the oldest art academies in Europe. n 1872 Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria approved a statute making the academy the supreme government authority for the arts. A new building was constructed according to plans designed by the faculty Theophil Hansen in the course of the layout of the Ringstraße boulevard."
 gaudi.529.g: "Expand the academy."
 gaudi.530.t: "Urania"
 gaudi.530.d: "With the Urania, a so-called 'people's education center' has opened in Vienna, the exact purpose of which is still disputed."
 gaudi.530.f: "In 1883 the German astronomer Max Wilhelm Meyer came to Vienna to calculate historical and future solar eclipses as an assistant at the University of Vienna. He also gave folklore lectures and developed the idea of a folk-educational institution. However, since he was called to Berlin in 1885, he continued to develop his ideas there. The Urania in Vienna was modeled on the Urania in Berlin: it had space for 800 people and contained a lecture hall for 200 people, rooms for scientific demonstrations and an observatory. However, this 'temporary' Urania could hardly cope with the influx of visitors, so that a new building on Ringstrasse soon became necessary. The Urania not only expanded its range of educational opportunities (e.g. through language courses), but also became a venue for concerts, with its own Urania symphony orchestra and Urania choir. The unconventional shape and construction caused the usual scandal in Vienna. The Viennese liked the building, however, and the Urania soon established itself as one of Vienna's landmarks."
 gaudi.530.g: "It is an architectural landmark."
 gaudi.530.h: "It is primarily an entertainment establishment."
 gaudi.530.i: "First and foremost this is an observatory."
