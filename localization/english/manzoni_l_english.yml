 manzoni.1100.t: "\"Heidi\" by Johanna Spyri published"
 manzoni.1100.d: "The Swiss author Johanna Spyri published a story about a young orphan girl living with her grandfather on the \"Alp\". After a rough start Heidi bonds with her grandfather and they enjoy living together. But soon they get seperated as Heidi has to move to Frankfurt am Main to live with Klara Streseman - daughter of a businessman. Will she ever see her grandfather again?"
 manzoni.1100.f: "The children listen eagerly to the maid reading from the new book. In their heads they become this girl in the mountains themselves, running around, playing, helping their grandfather. For a moment their fantasy lets them escape from the tightness of the city.\n\n#b Historically #! \"Heidi\" was published in 1880 and 1881. It was a story typically for its time showing the contrast of the idyllic mountains and the huge city of Frankfurt. In a time of upheavel the countryside was perceived as sort of a paradise by many. Soon after its publication Heidi was translated to other languages and became one of the most well known Swiss books.\n\n#b Today #! Heidi is still very popular. The book was translated to 50 languages and sold 50 million times. There are multiple movies, tv shows, comics and musicals. Heidi is especially popular in Japan causing many Japanese tourists to travel to Switzerland."
 manzoni.1100.g: "I wish I could live on the Alp!"

 manzoni.1101.t: "\"Kleider machen Leute\" by Gottfried Keller published"
 manzoni.1101.d: "Gottfried Keller is not an unknown writer. He published works like \"Der Grüne Heinrich\" and \"Die Leute von Seldwyla\". His newest story \"Kleider machen Leute\" is one story in the second part of \"Die Leute von Seldwyla\". A journeyman tailor who wasn't paid by his employer gets picked up by carriage on his way. When he arrives in the village of Goldach the people assume that he is a noble man because he arrived in a carriage, wears luxurious clothes and has groomed mustache. As he is quite shy he does not clear up the misunderstanding. Will the people find out about his secret?"
 manzoni.1101.f: "Such an exciting story. Will the journeyman tailor that accidentally pretended to be a polish count be exposed? Or will everything go well for him?\n\n#b Historically #! \"Kleider machen Leute\" was published in 1874. Its title is a German saying which translates to \"clothes make people\" which could be seen as a synopsis of the whole story. Keller was a writer in the literary tradition of the \"Bürgerlicher Realismus\" which often depicted the social circumstances in which people lived. Another aspect of this literary tradition was to show society a mirror. In \"Kleider machen Leute\" the people easily get convinced by looks. It does not matter who you are but more who you pretend to be. Maybe by reading the story some people challenged their own views?\n\nAs many other books of the time, \"Kleider machen Leute\" has become a classic of German literature. Especially students have to read the story in German classes. The topic of \"Kleider machen Leute\" probably is as relevant today as it was in the 19th Century."
 manzoni.1101.g: "Am I judging people by their looks or by their personality?"

 manzoni.1102.t: "\"Uli der Knecht\" by Jeremias Gotthelf published"
 manzoni.1102.d: "Under his pseudonym \"Jeremias Gotthelf\" Albert Bitzius, a Swiss pastor, published his book \"Uli der Knecht\". It is a typical work for Gotthelf as it features the farmhand Uli (Ulric) who has to overcome his sloppiness to find fulfilment. To achieve this he needs multiple role models and has to obey to different authority figures."
 manzoni.1102.f: "\"I am not thinking of you only but Ulric also. If he is not reproved, he will go from bad to worse. We must make it a matter of conscience, for whatever people may say about the new fashion, masters are still masters.\"\n\n#b Historically, #! \"Uli der Knecht\" was published in 1841. It is a typical story for Gotthelf as it is a \"Bildungsroman\". \"Bildungsroman\" is a literary genre in which the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist is the main aspect. \"Uli der Knecht\" shows this perfectly as Uli changes from a neglectful drunkard to a dutiful and frugal farmhand. During the time of its conception Switzerland was in a political struggle between conservatives and liberals that. The novel takes the view of the conservative side that was based in the countryside.\n\n\"Uli der Knecht\" is probably the most influential \"Bildungsroman\" of the 19th Century. To this day it is a classic of German literature. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is its heavy use of local dialect from the Canton of Bern. It includes word that are still in use to this day as well as word that are not used anymore for example \"Gunteräri\" a Bernese word for opposite."
 manzoni.1102.g: "Maybe I could find fulfilment if I listened to authority figures too?"

 manzoni.1103.t: "\"Der Steppenwolf\" by Hermann Hesse published"
 manzoni.1103.d: "Hermann Hesse published his newest book \"Der Steppenwolf\" that he wrote during his time in Basel. Hesse is already known for his other works like \"Siddharta\". In his newest story middle aged Harry Haller is unhappy with the burgeois society. He even considers to commit suicide but meeting the young Hermine and her colleagues changes his life. Hermine wouldn't be considered the best influence, as she prostitutes herself sometimes, but she can help Harry to experience things he didn't know before, releasing the \"Steppenwolf\" inside of him."
 manzoni.1103.f: "\"I wish I could just escape the burgeois world like Harry Haller...\" how many minds of the time had those thoughts while reading \"Steppenwolf\"? How many were not happy with the way of life in such a rational and boring world?\n\n#b Historically, #! \"Der Steppenwolf\" was published in 1927. Hesse - born in Germany but by that time a Swiss citizen - himself struggled with a depression during the time he wrote the book. In \"Steppenwolf\" Harry is in a similar situation as Hesse, he lives in a new town and hates the burgeois society. Like many other works of the time, Steppenwolf showed the inner struggle of a man with the rational and technological time he lived in.\n\nHermann Hesse is one of the most influential Swiss authors and one of only two Swiss writers to get awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. His works are often read in German Literature classes but even apart from that his stories are still relevant to this day."
 manzoni.1103.g: "Is my inner wolf roaring too?"

 manzoni.1104.t: "\"Histoire de monsieur Crépin\" by Rodolphe Töpffer published"
 manzoni.1104.d: "Rodolphe Töpffer published his newest bande desinée \"Histoire de monsieur Crépin\". It is not a traditional book but contains panels of pictures and short texts underneath. The story is a caricature of education in our country and shows absurd systems of teaching. Every new teacher shows of his form of education, progressively getting more absurd. The last teacher's teaching depends of the number of bulges on the head of each child."
 manzoni.1104.f: "   I have never seen so many pictures in one story! And they are drawn in the form of caricatures. What an interesting new way to tell stories!\n\n#b Historically, #! \"Histoire de monsieur Crépin\" was not the first bande desinée of Töpffer. His specific style that is an early form of comics was even praised by Goethe. After many of Töpffer's friends urged him to publish this new form of writing, Töpffer released his first bande desinée in 1827. Töpffer was one of the first to connect the technique of using panels with the art style of caricature. He also experimented with different sized pictures to create a feeling of time.\n\nTöpffer is not the most well known Swiss writer but his works were an important stepping stone for the creation of modern comics. Today a monument in Geneva commemorates his live and work."
 manzoni.1104.g: "Can I read more Bandes Desinées?"

 manzoni.1105.t: "\"Aline\" by C.F. Ramuz published"
 manzoni.1105.d: "C.F. Ramuz a writer from the French speaking part of Switzerland finished writing his first book. \"Aline\" follows the story of a young girl that helps her mother with household chores and to keep the huge garden in good shape. Then she finds the love of her life. The mother is not happy about it and forbids them from meeting. But that doesn't keep Aline from rendez-vous with him. For the man, Julien, son of the mayor, she is just one of many girls. Will they live happily ever after or will their love story end tragically?"
 manzoni.1105.f: "Love and Death. That is the topic of this book that starts so promising.\n\n#b Historically #! \"Aline\" was published in 1905 and was the first book by Ramuz. Later he became the most influential Swiss author of his generation and published many more books. His \"Histoire du soldat\" tells the story of a soldier trading his violin for a book that tells the future and was set to music by Igor Strawinsky in 1918.\n\nRamuz is probably the most important Swiss writer from the French speaking part of Switzerland. He was seen as so important for Switzerland, that his face was featured on the 200 Swiss Francs bill from 1995 until 2021."
 manzoni.1105.g: "Oh! Young love!"
