 mendelejew.101.t: "Theory of a New Element"
 mendelejew.101.d: "After extensive studies and investigations, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] postulated that there must still be an unknown element. The chemist calls this hypothetical #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_thought_variable').GetValue|0]#!. However, it still awaits discovery."
 mendelejew.101.f: "The term chemical element arose in the 17th century when it was increasingly recognized that the concept of elements in alchemy was unsuitable for a scientific explanation of the diverse properties of substances and their reactions with one another. Robert Boyle published an influential critique of the inadequacies of alchemy in 1661 called 'The Sceptical Chymist'. In it he explained that by chemical elements one should understand those primitive substances 'which have neither arisen from other substances nor from each other, but which form the components of which mixed substances are made'."
 mendelejew.101.g: "But hey, that's just a theory. A chemist's theory!"
 mendelejew.102.t: "A missing Element?"
 mendelejew.102.d: "In his recent research, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has determined that, given current knowledge, there must be other unknown elements. It is still unknown how exactly these can be determined, but a hypothesis should soon be formulated."
 mendelejew.102.f: "The term 'elements' (stoicheia) was first used by Greek philosopher Plato around 360 BCE in his dialogue Timaeus, which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a speculative treatise on chemistry. Plato believed the elements introduced a century earlier by Empedocles were composed of small polyhedral forms: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air), icosahedron (water), and cube (earth)."
 mendelejew.102.g: "How can something be missing that you don't know exists?"
 mendelejew.103.t: "Foreign Nation theorizes New Element"
 mendelejew.103.d: "To our chief chemist's regret, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] discovered today that a scientific article would be published in a foreign magazine that put forward a hypothesis about #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_thought_variable').GetValue|0]#! that Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHrselfHimselfe] wanted to theorize about. All research was stopped."
 mendelejew.103.f: "'Fortune favors the prepared mind.' -Louis Pasteur"
 mendelejew.103.g: "Impudence! Our publication was de facto in print!"

 mendelejew.111.t: "An absent Professor?"
 mendelejew.111.d: "[ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] is not only considered an excellent researcher but also a gifted teacher. However, the current obligations in the course of element research cause problems in the curriculum. There are already complaints that seminars and lectures are being neglected."
 mendelejew.111.f: "The German chemistry professor Justus von Liebig was particularly popular among his students because of his modern learning methods. His discoveries and writings soon made him known worldwide, with the result that, in addition to many Germans, numerous foreigners, including 84 English and 18 Americans, came to Giessen to hear Liebig's lectures on chemistry and pharmacy."
 mendelejew.111.g: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] should concentrate on research."
 mendelejew.111.h: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] should concentrate on lectureship."
 mendelejew.111.i: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] should find a balance."
 mendelejew.112.t: "A Dream"
 mendelejew.112.d: "[ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] tells of an inspiring dream at night that led him to being able to solve a theoretical chemical problem that he had previously failed at."
 mendelejew.112.f: "'I was sitting writing on my textbook, but the work did not progress; my thoughts were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire and dozed. Again the atoms were gamboling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by the repeated visions of the kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold conformation; long rows sometimes more closely fitted together all twining and twisting in snake-like motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and this time also I spent the rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth ... but let us beware of publishing our dreams before they have been put to the proof by the waking understanding.' -August Kekulé"
 mendelejew.112.g: "Are you saying that the Doctor even works in his sleep?"
 mendelejew.113.t: "Treatise on Chemistry"
 mendelejew.113.d: "As a side study to the actual theory regarding an unknown element, a treatise on chemistry was created. Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has so far only intended it for private use, but an assistant insists that it should be completed and published instead of just seeing it as a sketch."
 mendelejew.113.f: "Not only in chemistry, but in almost every academic discipline, it can happen that the research result actually sought is not achieved, but on the way there are much more interesting discoveries that are only recorded through hasty writing. It can often happen that the goal is briefly lost in order to devote oneself to something more groundbreaking."
 mendelejew.113.g: "This is just for a private research."
 mendelejew.113.h: "This study should be taught in the courses."
 mendelejew.113.i: "This publication is of scientific value - it should be publicly available!"
 mendelejew.114.t: "Daydreaming"
 mendelejew.114.d: "Our chemist, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName], pointed out that [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] needed special rest and opportunities for retreat, especially inspiring sleep, in order to successfully complete [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] research. However, not much has happened since then."
 mendelejew.114.f: "'If all the hypotheses are true, and this chemical formula is valid, then there should be... oh, a squirrel!'"
 mendelejew.114.g: "The chemist was just lazing around the whole time?!"
 mendelejew.115.t: "An Astronomical-Chemical Collaboration"
 mendelejew.115.d: "An exchange of ideas with the astronomer Dr. [ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] gave our chemist Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] groundbreaking impulses in [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] theorizing of a new element."
 mendelejew.115.f: "Even before the discovery of spectroscopy, but especially after, chemistry and astronomy continued to influence each other. Spectroscopy was initially used as an astronomical technique with experiments by William Hyde Wollaston, who built the first spectrometer to display the spectral lines of the sun's rays. These spectral lines were later characterized by Josef von Fraunhofer. Later, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen discovered that each chemical element was associated with a specific number and arrangement of spectral lines. They concluded from this that the lines observed by Wollaston and Fraunhofer were due to the absorption properties of these elements in the upper layers of the sun and that these must therefore also be present in the photosphere."
 mendelejew.115.g: "An academic synthesis!"

 mendelejew.201.t: "Discovery of a New Element"
 mendelejew.201.d: "It took arduous hours and sifting through a tiring amount of material, but Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] is now certain: if the last investigations are correct, then he has actually discovered the long-sought #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#!. This is a truly great day for our country!"
 mendelejew.201.f: "'We must expect the discovery of many yet unknown elements, for example, elements analogous to aluminium and silicon, whose atomic weight would be between 65 and 75.' -Dmitri Mendeleev"
 mendelejew.201.g: "And what does it taste like?"
 mendelejew.202.d: "Our chief chemist, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], is firmly of the opinion that the postulated #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#! actually exists and has decided to find it."
 mendelejew.202.f: "Of the elements in today's sense, only ten elements were known in their pure form in ancient times, which either occurred naturally or could be smelted from ore: carbon, sulfur, iron, copper, zinc, silver, tin, gold, mercury and lead. In the course of medieval mining history, small amounts of admixtures of unknown metals were discovered in ores, especially in the Ore Mountains, and were named after mountain spirits (cobalt, nickel). The discovery of phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand finally ushered in the age of discovery of most elements, including uranium from pitchblende by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1789."
 mendelejew.202.g: "Elementary research."
 mendelejew.203.t: "Foreign Nation discovers New Element"
 mendelejew.203.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] learned today at a conference that a foreign chemist managed to discover #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#! first. Demotivated by the news, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] stopped all research."
 mendelejew.203.f: "'I tried out various experiments described in treatises on physics and chemistry, and the results were sometimes unexpected. At times, I would be encouraged by a little unhoped-for success; at others, I would be in the deepest despair because of accidents and failures resulting from my inexperience.' -Marie Curie"
 mendelejew.203.g: "We have to prove that this is a false element!"

 mendelejew.211.t: "A new Laboratory?"
 mendelejew.211.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] complains that the chemical laboratory at his university is in poor condition. There is an urgent need to purchase new instruments and equipment. Otherwise, the discovery of new elements could be significantly delayed."
 mendelejew.211.f: "Setting up laboratories and purchasing new equipment or instruments was anything but a given. In many places, chemistry was still viewed negatively at the beginning of the 19th century. Despite his important rank, the chemist Justus von Liebig even had to pay for his laboratory equipment himself."
 mendelejew.211.g: "Fund a new laboratory with state-of-the-art equipment."
 mendelejew.211.h: "Make savings at the university to purchase new instruments."
 mendelejew.211.i: "And who is going to finance all of this?"
 mendelejew.212.t: "Unknown Chemical Compound"
 mendelejew.212.d: "During his efforts to finally discover #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#!, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has discovered a previously unknown chemical compound that could have practical benefits for industry."
 mendelejew.212.f: "A chemical compound is a chemical substance composed of many identical molecules (or molecular entities) containing atoms from more than one chemical element held together by chemical bonds. A molecule consisting of atoms of only one element is therefore not a compound. A compound can be transformed into a different substance by a chemical reaction, which may involve interactions with other substances. In this process, bonds between atoms may be broken or new bonds formed."
 mendelejew.212.g: "Great!"
 mendelejew.213.t: "Chemical Assistant"
 mendelejew.213.d: "In his search for the still undiscovered #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_searched_variable').GetValue|0]#!, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] gets helpful support from a talented assistant. Some colleagues think that he is even too good to work as a mere assistant."
 mendelejew.213.f: "'I was simply entranced by chemical phenomena, by the reactions in which substances, often with strikingly different properties, appear; and I hoped to learn more and more about this aspect of the world.' -Linus Pauling"
 mendelejew.213.g: "The assistant should focus on element research."
 mendelejew.213.h: "Encourage this scientific talent."
 mendelejew.214.t: "Bad Samples"
 mendelejew.214.d: "As it turns out, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] worked with impure samples for months and therefore derived false results from them."
 mendelejew.214.f: "'What do you mean it's just discolored quartz?!'"
 mendelejew.214.g: "A scientific setback."
 mendelejew.215.t: "A Geological-Chemical Collaboration"
 mendelejew.215.d: "An exchange of ideas with the geologist Dr. [ROOT.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] gave our chemist Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] groundbreaking impulses for the discovery of a new element."
 mendelejew.215.f: "Without new minerals that geologists have cataloged, the discovery of many chemical elements would not have been possible. In 1839, the German-Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein coined the term geochemistry. It is based on the concept of not only describing minerals, but also understanding the material basis and the chemical dynamics behind them."

 mendelejew.301.t: "Isolation of a New Element"
 mendelejew.301.d: "There is no longer any doubt: the #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#! not only exists, it can also be isolated using modern chemical methods. Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has decided to name the element #YELLOW [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('mendelejew_element_name')]#!."
 mendelejew.301.f: "'In nature nothing is created, nothing is lost, everything changes. We must trust to nothing but facts: These are presented to us by Nature, and cannot deceive.' -Antoine Lavoisier"
 mendelejew.301.g: "A triumph of science."
 mendelejew.302.d: "Although #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#! is considered 'discovered', its existence has not yet been verified until it can be isolated. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has decided to examine the element more closely, to check it and finally to make it accessible in its pure form."
 mendelejew.302.f: "The first modern list of elements was given in Antoine Lavoisier's 1789 Elements of Chemistry, which contained 33 elements, including light and caloric. By 1818, Jöns Jacob Berzelius had determined atomic weights for 45 of the 49 then-accepted elements. Dmitri Mendeleev had 63 elements in his periodic table of 1869."
 mendelejew.302.g: "I hope the lab is insured."
 mendelejew.303.t: "Foreign Nation isolates New Element"
 mendelejew.303.d: "Bad news! It looks like a foreign chemist has isolated #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#!. All the efforts and hopes that Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName]'s investments are in vain. Maybe we can explore another element?"
 mendelejew.303.f: "'It's the right idea, but not the right time. If I have succeeded better than many who surround me, it has been chiefly - may I say almost solely - from universal assiduity.' -John Dalton"
 mendelejew.303.g: "This scientific glory should have been ours..."

 mendelejew.311.t: "Chemical Synthesis"
 mendelejew.311.d: "During his attempts to isolate the #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#!, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] succeeded in a synthesis that was previously considered technically very demanding. This will benefit the economy and industry as well as science."
 mendelejew.311.f: "Chemical synthesis (chemical combination) is the artificial execution of chemical reactions to obtain one or several products. This occurs by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions. In modern laboratory uses, the process is reproducible and reliable. A chemical synthesis involves one or more compounds (known as reagents or reactants) that will experience a transformation when subjected to certain conditions. Various reaction types can be applied to formulate a desired product. This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel, such as a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask. Many reactions require some form of processing or purification procedure to isolate the final product"
 mendelejew.311.g: "Great."
 mendelejew.312.t: "Chemical Dissociation"
 mendelejew.312.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has made progress in his attempts to isolate #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#!. A chemical dissociation took him a decisive step further."
 mendelejew.312.f: "Dissociation in chemistry is a general process in which molecules (or ionic compounds such as salts, or complexes) separate or split into other things such as atoms, ions, or radicals, usually in a reversible manner. For instance, when an acid dissolves in water, a covalent bond between an electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom is broken by heterolytic fission, which gives a proton (H+) and a negative ion. Dissociation is the opposite of association or recombination."
 mendelejew.312.g: "Fantastic!"
 mendelejew.313.t: "Neglected Duties"
 mendelejew.313.d: "It is no secret that [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] uses his current research assignment regarding the isolation of #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_examined_variable').GetValue|0]#! as an excuse to avoid his remaining unpleasant academic obligations. The rector has now called him to account because he does not appear at university meetings or lectures."
 mendelejew.313.f: "No excuse is too great to stay away from the annoying creatures that generally bear the title of 'students'."
 mendelejew.313.g: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has more important things to do."
 mendelejew.313.h: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] must fulfill his other obligations."
 mendelejew.314.t: "An unforeseen Chemical Reaction"
 mendelejew.314.d: "During one of his last chemical experiments, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] apparently misinterpreted a few small things and thus slightly underestimated the effect of a reaction."
 mendelejew.314.f: "The newspapers are still reporting on the failed fire brigade operation, whose use of water fueled the chemical reaction even more instead of reducing the damage. Several students complained of smoke inhalation, and there were several injuries in the laboratory. The university building in the Faculty of Science has suffered significant damage and will have to be closed for months, if not years. The local newspaper was awaiting a statement from Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName], who, however, could not be reached after his short-term hospital stay due to a tennis tournament."
 mendelejew.314.g: "A disaster!"
 mendelejew.315.t: "An Ingenious-Chemical Collaboration"
 mendelejew.315.d: "The engineer Dr. [ROOT.Var('gaudi_engineer_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has improved some scientific equipment to assist Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] in the planned isolation of an element."
 mendelejew.315.f: "At the beginning of the 20th century, chemists and mechanical engineers worked together in the chemical industry, e.g. in the design of reactors and boilers, some of which were exposed to considerable stress (600 °C and 100 bar). The new discipline of chemical engineering ultimately developed at this interface, whose graduates today dominate the chemical industry."

 mendelejew.401.t: "A Chemical Experiment"
 mendelejew.401.d: "In order to take a break from his usual work,  Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] wants to use the space in the country's most important laboratory to carry out a chemical experiment. The experimental glasses are already ready."
 mendelejew.401.f: "From time to time, chemists come up with the idea of pursuing their passion instead of the tasks assigned to them. Every now and then, valuable findings actually emerge: for example, the improvement of fertilizers or the production of chemicals in industry. Whether such success occurs depends largely on the character traits, skills and experience of a chemist."
 mendelejew.401.g: "I'm excited to see what comes out of this experiment!"
 mendelejew.401.h: "Stop this nonsense."
 mendelejew.402.t: "Successful experiment"
 mendelejew.402.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] was right and actually gained useful knowledge from his latest experiment. The newly discovered chemical procedure will influence agriculture and industry in the coming years. Maybe the process will be named after [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim] at some point?"
 mendelejew.402.f1: "Through [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] experimental research, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has succeeded in producing a better fertilizer that promises richer harvests in the coming years."
 mendelejew.402.f2: "With [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] revolutionary process, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has laid the foundations for a special fertilizer that will be used particularly in plantation farming."
 mendelejew.402.f3: "The new process that [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has made accessible to industry should significantly improve production in chemical factories."
 mendelejew.402.g: "Success!"
 mendelejew.403.t: "Failed experiment"
 mendelejew.403.d: "Although his colleagues had high hopes for [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]'s work, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] experiment was not successful. Instead, [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] lost valuable time that would have been better spent on element research."
 mendelejew.403.f: "'Well, that didn't work as expected. At least the laboratory didn't explode!'"
 mendelejew.403.g: "Disappointing."

 mendelejew_synthetic_fuel_tech: "Synthetic Fuel"
 mendelejew_synthetic_fuel_tech_desc: "The Bergius-Pier process is a large-scale process for coal liquefaction by direct hydrogenation of coal. The macromolecules of the coal are broken down into smaller molecules by hydrogen at high pressures and temperatures. Gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons are created as products and are used as fuels and lubricants. Between 1910 and 1925, the German chemist Friedrich Bergius developed the basics of the process. Commercial process and catalyst development was carried out by BASF from 1925 under the project management of Matthias Pier."

 mendelejew.502.d: "[ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has initiated a new phase of mining in our country by patenting new processes in the production of explosives. With the new formula that Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has developed, production has become more efficient and fewer materials are required."
 mendelejew.502.f: "'Of course, these explosives will not make the miners safer. But if they are successful, then they are even more successful now. I have assured myself of the explosive power of our new dynamite - invented by Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] - and discovered that the miners now have to work less than ever. Basically they should pay me because there's nothing left to do other than sweep up some debris.'"

 mendelejew.503.d: "[ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] has initiated a significant change in the production of synthetic products. With the refinement of some formulas and improved processes, even more products can now be produced with less effort. [GetPlayer.GetName] has become more independent than ever from abroad and Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] is already considered a national hero."

 mendelejew.601.t: "Chemist Congress"
 mendelejew.601.d: "The preparations for the most important international meeting of chemists in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] are almost complete. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] took particular care to ensure that the event attracted the most important experts. Now all that's missing are the invitations."
 mendelejew.601.f: "Chemistry was established as a scientific discipline in the middle of the 19th century and still had a significant theoretical deficit. Different “schools” represented different views, particularly on questions of atomic and molecular construction. According to John Dalton, they were generally accepted as the smallest building blocks of chemical compounds, but next to nothing was known about their structure. Different views were also held on other fundamental theoretical questions such as the base size of atomic weights. The nomenclature and formula writing were also highly inconsistent. However, there was still no forum in which the current problems could be discussed. That's why three young professors of chemistry took the initiative to organize a congress in order to clarify the controversial questions in a discussion with colleagues in the field and invited the most important representatives of the subject to Karlsruhe for September 3rd to 5th, 1860."

 mendelejew.602.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('mendelejew_congress_host_country').GetName] has invited to an international Chemist Congress. Apparently people want to debate an internationally set weight of atoms. Dr. [SCOPE.sCharacter('mendelejew_chemist_scope').GetLastName] has received a warm invitation."
 mendelejew.602.g: "We have to react quickly!"
 mendelejew.604.t: "The Weight of an Atom"
 mendelejew.604.d: "Although the conference began promisingly, the effort to finally establish the weight of atoms internationally soon stalled. A faction of national-minded chemists did not want to give up their previous systems."
 mendelejew.604.f: "There was no agreement on several topics at the Karlsruhe Congress of 1860. One of the most important topics was atomic and molecular weights. Based on the findings of previous chemists, there was agreement that atoms are discrete particles and molecules are built from them, but several systems of atomic weights were used side by side. One was based on hydrogen, which was assigned the value 1 as the base unit, carbon was assigned 6 and oxygen was assigned 8. As long as there were uncertainties about the atomic weights, the elemental composition of the compounds examined was doubtful. There were up to five different weighting options, and because of the complicated conversions, some chemists were inclined not to change anything at all."
 mendelejew.604.g: "There is no reason to abandon the old system when there is so much disagreement."
 mendelejew.604.h: "We need a common, international atomic weight."
 mendelejew.605.t: "Chemist Conversations"
 mendelejew.605.d: "On the sidelines of the science conference, Dr. [SCOPE.sCharacter('mendelejew_chemist_scope').GetLastName] has the opportunity to exchange ideas with many professional colleagues from all over the world. The question remains how best to take advantage of this unique opportunity."
 mendelejew.605.f: "'There is, indeed, nothing surprising in this necessity for a hypothesis to assist us in the comprehension of laws. It often happens that the mind of a person who is learning a new science, has to pass through all the phases which the science itself has exhibited in its historic evolution.' -Stanislao Canizzaro"
 mendelejew.605.g: "Our chemist is supposed to collect new insights for the future."
 mendelejew.605.h: "Our chemist should look for solutions to current problems in his research."
 mendelejew.605.i: "Our chemist should send his assistants ahead so that they can learn something."
 mendelejew.609.t_national: "Chemistry Congress ends inconclusively"
 mendelejew.609.d_national: "For three days, organizers and leading experts in the field of chemistry tried to save the event, but ultimately no universal rule could be found as to how atomic weight should be reported. The nation states will be stuck with the traditional systems for some time, which makes conversion tables necessary."
 mendelejew.609.f_national: "The Karlsruhe Congress was the first specialist congress of a scientific discipline. Even though there were no decisive results, the Karlsruhe Chemists' Congress can be considered the most important event in the history of chemistry in the 19th century. The meeting of so many chemists from home and abroad had a catalytic effect on the further development of theoretical chemistry."
 mendelejew.609.g: "This will set us back years."
 mendelejew.609.t_international: "Chemistry Congress ends with Agreement"
 mendelejew.609.d_international: "Fortunately, the chemists at the science congress found a uniform solution for atomic weight. It is now internationally recognized. The scientists refer to a theorem from Amedeo Avogadro. Dr. [SCOPE.sCharacter('mendelejew_chemist_scope').GetLastName] happily announced the success in a letter today."
 mendelejew.609.f_international: "An important long-term result of the Karlsruhe Congress was the adoption of the now-familiar atomic weights. Following the Karlsruhe meeting, values of about 1 for hydrogen, 12 for carbon, 16 for oxygen, and so forth were adopted. This was based on a recognition that certain elements, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, were composed of diatomic molecules and not individual atoms. "
 mendelejew.609.h: "A breakthrough for chemistry!"
