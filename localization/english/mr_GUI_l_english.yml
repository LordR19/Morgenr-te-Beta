After several years of preparatory work, the company succeeded in 1931 in using an airship for a purely scientific polar expedition for the first time. Through the Arctic flight of the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, knowledge of the geography of the polar regions flown over was significantly expanded.

The discovery of Neptune raised the question of whether a new category might make more sense for the numerous, smaller objects found particularly between Mars and Jupiter. In particular, the invention of new astronomical symbols and their relatively small size led astronomers to assume that they were more likely 'small stars' or 'small planets'. Of course, this categorization would mean that some of the objects previously considered planets would lose their status and would be degraded to mere boulders.\n\n[ScriptedGui.BuildTooltip( GuiScope.SetRoot( GetPlayer.MakeScope ).End )]"

In Expressionism, the expressive level outweighs the aesthetic, appellative and factual level. The artist wants to represent his experience for the viewer.
