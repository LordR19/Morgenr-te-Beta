 #Objectives
 objective_morgenroete: "Thriving Culture"
 objective_morgenroete_desc: "Any barbaric country can conquer a patch of earth. But higher civilization shows itself in the realm of science and culture. Uncover archeological treasures, discover new stars and planets, hire composers, collect exotic animals and plants, embark on research trips or set records in the aviation age. A new morning dawns!"

 objective_morgenroete_name_AUS: "Austria"
 objective_morgenroete_desc_AUS: "Bella gerant alii, tu felix Austria nube! Are these times over for Austria? The Congress of Vienna and Metternich pushed Austria one last time into the central position of Europe, but the ambitions of Prussia and Russia threaten the compromise-oriented policy of the Habsburg Empire. As in the past, can Austria triumph in the future by becoming a center of attraction for culture and lifestyle? Defends Vienna's reputation as a music metropolis and develop it into the most attractive city in Europe."
 objective_morgenroete_name_BEL: "Belgium"
 objective_morgenroete_desc_BEL: "Belgium is not only an aspiring economic power, but also has all sorts of options to flourish in the scientific field: in paleontology, astronomy, but also through Pacific expeditions, the small country could consolidate its world fame, which others acquire through war. Is the Congo just a colony, or the destination of a botanical expedition? And is Brussels just a transit area for traveling composers, or will the country try to establish its own musical tradition?"
 objective_morgenroete_name_SAR: "Sardinia-Piemont"
 objective_morgenroete_desc_SAR: "Sardinia-Piedmont finds itself in a tricky situation: on the one hand, can it muster its political and military forces to unite the Italian nation - and on the other hand live up to the reputation of being an Italian cultural nation? A united Italy would have new opportunities, from the construction of the Mole Antonelliana and musical successes to flight records at the Schneider Trophy."
 objective_morgenroete_name_SWI: "Switzerland"
 objective_morgenroete_desc_SWI: "As a landlocked country, Switzerland may be worse off when it comes to expeditions to far-flung places, but it has significant potential within its borders. Clever decisions in the promotion of classical music enable the Alpine state to motivate possibly one of the great composers to stay. A formation is useful for paleontology. And then there is always the project of the century contemplated by Alfred Escher: a huge tunnel through the middle of the mountains..."

 mr_appoint_chief_engineer_desc: "With a chief engineer, the monthly construction progress of monuments get an additional construction point."
 mr_dismiss_chief_engineer: "Dismiss Chief Engineer"
  
 #Visit Special Building JE
 je_mr_visit_building: "Visit Special Buildings"
 je_mr_visit_building_reason: "A visit to one of the important buildings in our country can help to deepen knowledge about a specialist area. Artefacts found can be admired and exhibitions organized in archaeological museums. Observatories provide information about the status of international and national astronomical research. The opera lists the major composers currently alive, as well as a detailed listing of our annually generated musical tradition. In the zoo, the animals caught so far can be visited and further information can be obtained. The fossil collection shows an overview of fossils and dinosaur bones found so far, and dinosaur skeletons can also be assembled here."

 #Scientific Expeditions JE
 je_mr_scientific_expeditions: "Scientific Expeditions"
 je_mr_scientific_expeditions_reason: ""
 
 mr_pacific_expedition_button: "Pacific Expedition"
 mr_pacific_expedition_button_desc: "Along with the poles, the Pacific Ocean is one of the last areas on earth that still hold secrets. Scholars from multiple scientific disciplines are interested in a research mission to conduct naturalistic, paleontological, astronomical and oceanographic studies. Again, for the great powers it could be a prestigious affair to show their influence at the end of the world."
 mr_arctica_expedition_button: "Zeppelin Expedition"
 mr_arctica_expedition_button_desc: "The Aeroarctic, the 'International Study Society for the Exploration of the Arctic by Airship' was a non-governmental scientific association that had set itself the goal of using airships in polar research. It was founded mainly on the initiative of the aeronaut and later general secretary of the society, Walther Bruns. The founding president in 1924 was Fridtjof Nansen. After several years of preparatory work, the company succeeded in 1931 in using an airship for a purely scientific polar expedition for the first time. Through the Arctic flight of the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, knowledge of the geography of the polar regions flown over was significantly expanded. As early as 1926 Umberto Nobile flew over the North Pole with his airship 'Norge' and later undertook an expedition with the 'Italia'."
 mr_safari_expedition_button: "Heia Safari"
 mr_safari_expedition_button_desc: "On an African safari, through constant tracking and trapping, large game can be captured and then transported to a [concept_dubois_zoo]. It is only possible to catch one animal per safari. Depending on the animal species, it differs whether you need traps or have to stay on their trail. As a rule of thumb, large, sluggish animals need more traps, while fast animals require more tracking."
 mr_zoological_expedition_button: "Zoological Expedition"
 mr_zoological_expedition_button_desc: "Our nation has animal habitats with fascinating species that could be displayed in a [concept_dubois_zoo]. A [concept_dubois_naturalist] is to travel across the country for a year to collect [Concept('concept_dubois_zoo_animal','$concept_dubois_exotic_animals$')] for a zoo."
 mr_botanical_expedition_button: "Botanical Expedition"
 mr_botanical_expedition_button_desc: "Botanical expeditions (sometimes called 'Plant hunting') are scientific voyages designed to explore the flora of a particular region. A [concept_dubois_naturalist] would be responsible for identification, description and collection of specimens."
 mr_botanical_expedition_recall_button: "Recall Naturalist"
 mr_botanical_expedition_recall_button_desc: "Orders the [concept_dubois_naturalist] back from his botanical research to use it for other purposes - such as capturing animals."
 mr_paleontological_expedition_button: "Paleontological Expedition"
 mr_paleontological_expedition_button_desc: "A [concept_dubois_paleontologist] can find new fossils in formations every year. Great Formations also have a chance of discovering rare dinosaur bones that can be used to reconstruct skeletons. To do this, the paleontologist must be assigned to a formation. If no formation is within one's borders, a Paleontological License Agreement can also be negotiated with a country that has a Great Formation."
 mr_paleontological_expedition_recall_button: "Recall Paleontologist"
 mr_paleontological_expedition_recall_button_desc: "Orders the paleontologist back from his paleontological investigation for other uses - such as building or remodeling dinosaur skeletons."
