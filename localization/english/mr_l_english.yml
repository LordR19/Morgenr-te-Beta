 je_mr_visit_building: "Visit Special Buildings"
 je_mr_visit_building_reason: "A visit to one of the important buildings in our country can help to deepen knowledge about a specialist area. Artefacts found can be admired and exhibitions organized in archaeological museums. Observatories provide information about the status of international and national astronomical research. The opera lists the major composers currently alive, as well as a detailed listing of our annually generated musical tradition. In the zoo, the animals caught so far can be visited and further information can be obtained. The fossil collection shows an overview of fossils and dinosaur bones found so far, and dinosaur skeletons can also be assembled here."

 mr_pacific_expedition_button: "Pacific Expedition"
 mr_pacific_expedition_button_desc: "Along with the poles, the Pacific Ocean is one of the last areas on earth that still hold secrets. Scholars from multiple scientific disciplines are interested in a research mission to conduct naturalistic, paleontological, astronomical and oceanographic studies. Again, for the great powers it could be a prestigious affair to show their influence at the end of the world."
 mr_arctica_expedition_button: "Zeppelin Expedition"
 mr_arctica_expedition_button_desc: "The Aeroarctic, the 'International Study Society for the Exploration of the Arctic by Airship' was a non-governmental scientific association that had set itself the goal of using airships in polar research. It was founded mainly on the initiative of the aeronaut and later general secretary of the society, Walther Bruns. The founding president in 1924 was Fridtjof Nansen. After several years of preparatory work, the company succeeded in 1931 in using an airship for a purely scientific polar expedition for the first time. Through the Arctic flight of the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, knowledge of the geography of the polar regions flown over was significantly expanded. As early as 1926 Umberto Nobile flew over the North Pole with his airship 'Norge' and later undertook an expedition with the 'Italia'."

 mr_safari_expedition_button_desc: "On an African safari, through constant tracking and trapping, large game can be captured and then transported to a [concept_dubois_zoo]. It is only possible to catch one animal per safari. Depending on the animal species, it differs whether you need traps or have to stay on their trail. As a rule of thumb, large, sluggish animals need more traps, while fast animals require more tracking."

 mr_paleontological_expedition_button_desc: "A [concept_dubois_paleontologist] can find new fossils in formations every year. Great Formations also have a chance of discovering rare dinosaur bones that can be used to reconstruct skeletons. To do this, the paleontologist must be assigned to a formation. If no formation is within one's borders, a Paleontological License Agreement can also be negotiated with a country that has a Great Formation."
