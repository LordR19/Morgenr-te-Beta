 #Objectives
 objective_thriving_culture: "Thriving Culture"
 objective_thriving_culture_desc: "Any barbaric country can conquer a patch of earth. But higher civilization shows itself in the realm of science and culture. Uncover archeological treasures, discover new stars and planets, hire composers, collect exotic animals and plants, embark on research trips or set records in the aviation age. A new morning dawns!"

 objective_thriving_culture_name_AUS: "Austria"
 objective_thriving_culture_desc_AUS: "Bella gerant alii, tu felix Austria nube! Are these times over for Austria? The Congress of Vienna and Metternich pushed Austria one last time into the central position of Europe, but the ambitions of Prussia and Russia threaten the compromise-oriented policy of the Habsburg Empire. As in the past, can Austria triumph in the future by becoming a center of attraction for culture and lifestyle? Defend Vienna's reputation as a music metropolis and develop it into the most attractive city in Europe."
 objective_thriving_culture_name_BEL: "Belgium"
 objective_thriving_culture_desc_BEL: "Belgium is not only an aspiring economic power, but also has all sorts of options to flourish in the scientific field: in paleontology, astronomy, but also through Pacific expeditions, the small country could consolidate its world fame, which others acquire through war. Is the Congo just a colony, or the destination of a botanical expedition? And is Brussels just a transit area for traveling composers, or will the country try to establish its own musical tradition?"
 objective_thriving_culture_name_SAR: "Sardinia-Piemont"
 objective_thriving_culture_desc_SAR: "Sardinia-Piedmont finds itself in a tricky situation: on the one hand, can it muster its political and military forces to unite the Italian nation - and on the other hand live up to the reputation of being an Italian cultural nation? A united Italy would have new opportunities, from the construction of the Mole Antonelliana and musical successes to flight records at the Schneider Trophy."
 objective_thriving_culture_name_SWI: "Switzerland"
 objective_thriving_culture_desc_SWI: "As a landlocked country, Switzerland may be worse off when it comes to expeditions to far-flung places, but it has significant potential within its borders. Clever decisions in the promotion of classical music enable the Alpine state to motivate possibly one of the great composers to stay. A formation is useful for paleontology. And then there is always the project of the century contemplated by Alfred Escher: a huge tunnel through the middle of the mountains..."

 objective_thriving_culture_idle_header: "Continue on your path"
 objective_thriving_culture_idle_hint: "More challenges will appear eventually"

 thriving_culture_lesson_button_skip: "Forza!"
 thriving_culture_complete_desc: "Congratulations! Your nation is the cultural poster child of this age! Have you really discovered all facets of Morgenröte? Have you traveled to the Center of the Earth? Have you rediscovered the Lost World? Found Atlantis? Discovered Shangri-La? No? Then how can you say you're done?"
 thriving_culture_lesson_button_complete: "There is more?"

 je_objective_dawn_of_a_new_era: "Dawn of a New Era"
 je_objective_dawn_of_a_new_era_reason: "In the 19th century, pure passion for collecting turned into scientific methods and systematics. No corner of the planet is inaccessible anymore, no past, no matter how dark, seems unfathomable. Everything can be measured, analyzed and interpreted. It is time to create a scientific collection that lives up to this claim."

 je_objective_more_than_politics: "More than Politics"
 je_objective_more_than_politics_reason: "Beauty and truth have a greater value than the despicable struggle for power. The construction of significant scientific and cultural institutions should be a sign of what really counts in the face of history."
 je_objective_assemble_dinosaur_skeleton: "Reconstruct a Dinosaur"
 je_objective_assemble_dinosaur_skeleton_reason: "The paleontological efforts of our country should not be neglected. An imposing dinosaur skeleton could be the start of an exquisite collection!"
 je_objective_relevant_culture: "Internationally Relevant Culture"
 je_objective_relevant_culture_reason: "At home we have already demonstrated our affinity for the fine arts and sciences, but in order for the whole world to know this, we must greatly increase our efforts - in which field we specialize is entirely up to us."

 #Scientific Conferences JE
 je_mr_scientific_conferences: "Scientific Conferences"
 je_mr_scientific_conferences_reason: "How old is the earth? Where does man come from? How credible is the Bible as a historical source? Is the universe infinite - and what are galaxies actually? Over the course of a hundred years, not only science as such, but also people's view of the world has changed significantly. The theory of evolution has shaken man's certainty just as much as the theory of relativity. Scientific conferences are intended to clarify some of the fundamental questions by having international scientists discuss them."

 #Archaeology JE
 je_mr_archaeology: "Archaeology"
 je_mr_archaeology_reason: "The 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a rapid development in the field of antiquity research: from treasure digging to serious science. The excavation of Troy by Heinrich Schliemann and the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen by Howard Carter are just two of the most famous highlights of this era. At the same time, they show that not only scientific thirst, but also national prestige played an important role in recovering valuable artifacts. With the (almost) complete decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphs by Karl Richard Lepsius in 1837, this new era was to begin."
 
 mr_upper_egypt_expedition_button: "The Valley of the Kings"
 mr_upper_egypt_expedition_button_desc: "With the old capital Thebes and the Valley of the Kings, Upper Egypt is considered the Mecca of Egyptology. We should acquire an excavation license for the area and search for Egyptian treasures."
 mr_lower_egypt_expedition_button: "The Pyramids"
 mr_lower_egypt_expedition_button_desc: "Since the beginning of time, the Egyptian pyramids have fascinated mankind. It is said that other tombs, temples and even cities that have disappeared in the sands of Lower Egypt are waiting to be rediscovered."
 mr_babylonia_expedition_button: "The Cradle of Civilization"
 mr_babylonia_expedition_button_desc: "Babylonia, the southern part of Mesopotamia, owes its name to the once powerful city of Babylon. The region is considered the 'cradle of civilization' where precious archaeological artifacts are discovered again and again. They definitely belong in a museum."
 mr_assyria_expedition_button: "The Gardens of Assyria"
 mr_assyria_expedition_button_desc: "Assyria refers to the northern part of Mesopotamia with the two important cities of Assur and Nineveh. The sparse knowledge about the country can still be traced back to the Bible as a source - but maybe there is historical evidence that is more reliable?"
 mr_argolis_expedition_button: "Agamemnon's city"
 mr_argolis_expedition_button_desc: "After the discovery of Troy, even skeptical scientists come to realize that the myths of the ancient Greeks are more than just fairy tales. The remains of Bronze Age cities are said to lie in Argolis to this day, the best known of which is Mycenae. We should convince ourselves of that."
 mr_crete_expedition_button: "The Tale of the Minotaur"
 mr_crete_expedition_button_desc: "The legendary King Minos is said to have once ruled over Crete. Similar to Troy and Mycenae, there also seems to be something to this story: artifacts from the legendary Minoan culture are increasingly found on the island. Our nation should also secure a few of them."
 mr_yucatan_expedition_button: "Lost Cities of the Maya"
 mr_yucatan_expedition_button_desc: "Reports of unknown and huge cities in the middle of the jungle increased. We should investigate further and send an archaeological expedition to Yucatán."
 mr_peru_expedition_button: "The Hidden Legacy of the Incas"
 mr_peru_expedition_button_desc: "Pilots report strange fortresses and walled structures in the Andes that they saw on their flights over Peru. Maybe the Spaniards didn't completely destroy the culture of the Incas? Some towns of indigenous resistance have not been found to this day."

 mr_first_excavation_team_button: "First Archaeological Team"
 mr_first_excavation_team_button_desc: "We can train an additional team of archaeologists. This means that several excavations are possible at the same time."
 mr_second_excavation_team_button: "Second Archaeological Team"
 mr_second_excavation_team_button_desc: "We can train an additional team of archaeologists. This means that several excavations are possible at the same time."
 mr_third_excavation_team_button: "Third Archaeological Team"
 mr_third_excavation_team_button_desc: "We can train an additional team of archaeologists. This means that several excavations are possible at the same time."
 mr_fourth_excavation_team_button: "Fourth Archaeological Team"
 mr_fourth_excavation_team_button_desc: "We can train an additional team of archaeologists. This means that several excavations are possible at the same time."

 mr_inspect_excavation_button: "Archeological Inspection"
 mr_inspect_excavation_button_desc: "We can send an experienced archaeologist to an area where we are excavating to intensify our efforts there. Our archaeologist will open up a new excavation site in about a year and conduct intensive research, during which we can find further indications of previously unknown, major archaeological discoveries. The success largely depends on the experience of our archaeologist. The establishment of an Archaeological Society also increases our chances."
 mr_cancel_excavation_button: "Recall one of our Excavation Teams"
 mr_cancel_excavation_button_desc: "In some situations it can be useful to recall an excavation team. Our acquired artifacts and collections will remain, but our permanent excavation will end."
 mr_local_excavation_button: "Local Archaeological Excavation"
 mr_local_excavation_button_desc: "Archaeological treasures aren't just waiting to be uncovered far away. Although Local Excavations are considered less prestigious than the search for the famous artifacts, it does provide an insight into the mostly prehistoric era of our home region. Unlike excavations following an expedition, Local Excavations cannot be completed until funding runs out."

 mr_romantic_composer_button: "Hire a new [concept_elgar_composer] (Romanticism)"
 mr_composer_button_desc: "Unlike [Concept('concept_elgar_great_composer','$concept_elgar_great_composers$')], ordinary [Concept('concept_elgar_composer','$concept_elgar_composers$')] are responsible for day-to-day operations. They can be hired as conductors and give their country a passive [concept_elgar_musical_tradition] bonus. A composer can be hired three times per game, which requires research into a specific technology (Romanticism, Irrationalism, Neoclassicism/New Objectivity/Art Deco). A country can only support one ordinary composer, and a ten-year investment in the country's musical culture is required."
 mr_wagnerian_composer_button: "Hire a new [concept_elgar_composer] (Irrationalism)"
 mr_modern_composer_button: "Hire a new [concept_elgar_composer] (Modern)"
 mr_appoint_conductor_button: "Appoint a Chief Conductor"
 mr_appoint_conductor_button_desc: "Conductors run the national music business, particularly a country's leading [Concept('concept_elgar_opera','$concept_elgar_opera_house$')]. In the opera house they can be entrusted with a specific task for three years: conducting, composing or a tour. In this way they are similar to the [Concept('concept_elgar_great_composer','$concept_elgar_great_composers$')], although their earnings for the [concept_elgar_musical_tradition] are kept within manageable limits."

 mr_national_conservatory_button: "Found a National Conservatory"
 mr_national_conservatory_button_desc: ""With a Conservatory, there is a chance that characters with the Composer trait will appear over time without having to hire them. The chance is very small, but it is there. The probability can be increased with a ballet school in one of our opera schools."
 mr_santa_cecilia_button: "Make Santa Cecilia an Academy"
 mr_santa_cecilia_button_desc: "The Accademia di Santa Cecilia was founded by the papal bull 'Ratione congruit' by Sixtus V in 1585 in the form of a congregation. In 1838 the Congregation of Saint Cecilia was officially named an Academy and then the Pontifical Academy. Its members at that time included Luigi Cherubini, Mercadante, Donizetti, Rossini, Paganini, Auber, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Berlioz, Gounod and Meyerbeer. One of its honorary members was Queen Victoria. In united Italy it developed into a leading conservatory."
 mr_leipzig_conservatory_button: "Found the Leipzig Conservatory"
 mr_leipzig_conservatory_button_desc: "The traditional music city of Leipzig, where Johann Sebastian Bach was already active, offered optimal conditions for the founding of a musical and academic talent factory at the beginning of the 19th century. Four committed citizens of the city, namely the lawyer Heinrich Conrad Schleinitz (second director), the district director of Leipzig Johann Paul von Falkenstein and the Royal Saxon Court Councilor Johann Georg Keil as well as the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy put the previous ideas into practice."
 mr_petrograd_conservatory_button: "Found the Petrograd Conservatory"
 mr_petrograd_conservatory_button_desc: "On the initiative of the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, Anton Rubinstein, Andrei Nikolayevich Markovich and other personalities of society and musical life, the Russian Music Society was founded, from whose music classes the first conservatory in Russia was founded. Anton Rubinstein was the first director of the conservatory and professor of piano. The first graduate to complete his composition studies here was Peter Tchaikovsky. Nikolai Andreyevich Rimsky-Korsakov had a particularly influential role as professor of composition and instrumentation and head of the orchestra class."
 mr_bayreuth_button: "Establish the Richard Wagner Festival"
 mr_bayreuth_button_desc: "Richard Wagner has long dreamed of having his own festival hall where his greatest works are performed every year. Such a place could quickly become a place of pilgrimage for all music enthusiasts and would be a lasting, living memorial in his honor."
 mr_concertgebouw_button: "Establish the Concertgebouw"
 mr_concertgebouw_button_desc: "The Concertgebouw is the most famous concert hall in Amsterdam and home to the Concertgebouw Orchestra. The Netherlands had long lagged behind the rest of musical development on the continent, but the Concertgebouw ensured that Amsterdam soon ranked among the top European music capitals. This was also due to the high quality offered by the Concertgebouw Orchestra, especially under the direction of their future conductor Willem Mengelberg."
 mr_the_proms_button: "Institute the Promenade Concerts"
 mr_the_proms_button_desc: "The Proms is an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music concerts and other events held annually. Prom is short for promenade concert, a term which originally referred to outdoor concerts in London's pleasure gardens. The season is a significant event in British culture and in classical music. Many people's perception of the Proms is based on the Last Night, although this is very different from the other concerts."
