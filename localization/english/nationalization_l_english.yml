 je_nationalization_germanization: "Germanization"
 je_nationalization_germanization_reason: "After the founding of the German Empire in 1871, the Germans' sense of unity was already very widespread in the various federal states. The urgent need to unify the German states had existed since 1848. Only in Bavaria did a specific regional feeling prevail until well into the 20th century, but this was increasingly pushed back. Joint wars, a national education system, joint military service and the construction of national institutions such as barracks, military ports and administrative facilities are likely to ensure that a significantly stronger all-German identity emerges from the arduous process of national unity in the next few years."
 je_nationalization_germanization_goal: "#O National Identity Progress#! reaches #G 250#!."

 je_nationalization_german_national_identity: "German Identity"
 je_nationalization_german_national_identity_reason: "After a few years of growing together and a few reforms, the feeling of being connected to a pan-German identity is increasingly spreading among the general population. This feeling will spread from region to region, no matter how the state sets the right framework: regions that are well served by government administrations, universities, barracks or naval bases are more likely to develop an all-German identity due to their integrative function. Heavily urbanized areas are more likely to find access to a concept that was previously only researched by intellectuals. Under perfect circumstances, one sub-state could adopt the new identity every year."

 nationalization.102.t: "A Pan-German Consciousness"
 nationalization.102.d: "Now that the entire population of Germany no longer sees itself primarily as belonging to its regional identity but to its national identity, this has an impact not only on Germans at home but also across the world."
 nationalization.102.f: "With the establishment of the German national state and the enforcement of the pan-German identity, those Germans outside the borders - whether as emigrants in the world or originally living under foreign rule - will also identify themselves primarily as Germans."
 nationalization.102.g: "As far as the German tongue sounds!" 

 nationalization.103.d: "With the establishment of the German national state and the enforcement of the pan-German identity, those Germans outside the borders - whether as emigrants in the world or originally living under foreign rule - will also identify themselves primarily as Germans. In our country, too, there is now an urge to identify as German, instead of just referring to regional origins, as was previously the case."
 nationalization.103.g: "But could this invention be dangerous for humanity?"

 nationalization.104.g: "Welcome, brothers!"

 nationalization.111.t: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('german_character_scope').GetLastName] supports the German Cause"
 nationalization.111.d: "In the wake of the growing call for a pan-German identity, [SCOPE.sCharacter('german_character_scope').GetFullName] has completely identified with the ideals of a united German nation state. He sees his own origins as secondary and emphasizes his national German identity."

 nationalization.113.f: "After German unification, a brisk building activity began, which is reflected in an extraordinary culture of monuments. Together with the Barbarossa Monument on the Kyffhäuserberg, the Deutsches Eck in Koblenz, the Hermannsdenkmal near Detmold in the southern Teutoburg Forest, the Kaiser Wilhelm Monument at the Porta Westfalica, the Völkerschlachtdenkmal in Leipzig, the Bismarck Monument in Hamburg and the Walhalla near Donaustauf The Niederwald Monument is one of the monumental memorial buildings in Germany that were predominantly built during the time of the German Empire.

 je_nationalization_frenchization: "Frenchization"
 je_nationalization_frenchization_reason: "From 1881 onwards, children who spoke Occitan at school were punished in accordance with minister Jules Ferry's recommendations; this led to a deprecation of the language known as la vergonha (the shaming). This also applied to other parts of France, which had been struggling under centralization efforts since the French Revolution. From the end of the 19th century, the French state increased its efforts to further reduce regional differences in favor of a monolithic identity."

 nationalization_frenchization_tt: "The local Occitan, Franco-Provençal, Breton and Wallonian populations become a French. Their homelands will be transformed into French homelands."

 nationalization_pan_french_identity_tt: "Worldwide, all Occitan, Franco-Provençal, Breton and Wallonian populations will now identify themselves as a pan-French population."

 nationalization.201.t: "Frenchization in [SCOPE.sState('frenchization_state').GetName]"
 nationalization.201.d: "After years of political influence and intensive education, the population in [SCOPE.sState('frenchization_state').GetName] has become indistinguishable from other French citizens. Their lifestyle and culture corresponds to that of Paris."
 nationalization.201.f: "'The Parisian is to the French what the Athenian was to the Greeks: no one sleeps better than he, no one is more openly frivolous and idle, no one appears more heedless. But this is misleading. He is given to every kind of listlessness, but when there is glory to be won he may be inspired with every kind of fury. Give him a pike and he will enact the tenth of August, a musket and you have Austerlitz. He was the springboard of Napoleon and the mainstay of Danton. At the cry of 'la patrie' he enrols, and at the call of liberty he tears up the pavements. Beware of him!' -Victor Hugo"
 nationalization.201.g: "Stay clean, speak French."

 nationalization.202.t: "Frenchization complete"
 nationalization.202.d: "The years of effort have been worth it. France is a nation with one language, one culture and one central capital. The time for linguistic and cultural differences is over. The education of the French is a milestone in our history"
 nationalization.202.f: "With the the enforcement of the French identity, the francophone community outside the borders - whether as emigrants in the world or originally living under foreign rule - will also identify themselves primarily as French."
 nationalization.202.g: "The day of glory is here!" 

 nationalization.204.t: "Occitan integrated"

 je_nationalization_swissiziation: "Swissiziation"
 je_nationalization_swissiziation_reason: "With Switzerland's transformation from a confederation of states to a federal state, the Alpine republic, in which the constituent states have jealously guarded their rights, grows together into a real nation state. Now it is time to form national feeling in order to assert a unified Swiss identity against other countries."
 je_nationalization_swissiziation_goal: "#O National Identity Progress#! reaches #G 50#!."
 je_nationalization_swiss_national_identity: "Swiss Identity"
 je_nationalization_swiss_national_identity_reason: "In the age of rampant nationalism, Switzerland also has to defend its role - in France, Italy and Germany people think that anything that speaks French, Italian or German must also be French, Italian and German. A Swiss identity of its own could assert itself against its neighbors, aware of Switzerland's peculiarities over the centuries."

 nationalization.301.g: "Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno!"

 nationalization.302.t: "Swissiziation complete"
 nationalization.302.d: "The entire population of Switzerland no longer sees itself primarily as belonging to its regional identity but to its national identity. From now on no French, Italian or German nation can so easily claim that we are just a mixture of different peoples."
 nationalization.302.f: "We want to be a single People of brethren,\nNever to part in danger nor distress.\nWe want to be free, as our fathers were,\nAnd rather die than live in slavery.\nWe want to trust in the one highest God\nAnd never be afraid of human power."
 nationalization.302.g: "We are a nation of will." 

 nationalization.313.t: "A monument to Wilhelm Tell"
 nationalization.313.d: "William Tell is considered one of the mythical founding figures of Switzerland and has a comparable status to the Rütli Oath in the historical memory of the population. Many patriots want to erect a statue in his honor to inspire the newly awakened national consciousness."
 nationalization.313.f: "'The good man thinks of himself last.' -Friedrich Schiller"
 nationalization.313.g: "We need to glorify our past."
 nationalization.313.h: "And who should pay for that?"

 united_swiss: "Swiss"

 nationalization_swiss_consiousness_capital_tt: "The local Alemannic, Franco-Provencal, Ticinese and Rumantsch populations of our capital state become one Swiss population.
