 panum.100.t: "The Cholera Epidemic of [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.Format('y')]"
 panum.100.d: "#YELLOW Cholera#!, one of humanity's worst scourges, has spread to one of our cities. Dark times have begun. We must expect it to spread across the country - and take its toll."
 panum.100.f: "Cholera, endemic to East Asia, probably occurred in the Indian subcontinent over several centuries in the form of localized epidemics, but was unknown on other continents. The first pandemic occurred between 1817 and 1824 and affected parts of Asia as well as East Africa and Asia Minor and subsequently Russia and Europe. In 1830 it appeared in Eastern Galicia and Hungary, and in June 1831 in Vienna. It overwhelmed the world in a total of six pandemics and became the scourge of the emerging industrial society. Although most infections (around 85 percent) are asymptomatic, the mortality rate at the beginning is between 20 and 70 percent, if the disease is left untreated."
 panum.100.g: "Grim Reaper is at our doorstep."
 panum.101.t: "Cholera spreads to [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]"
 panum.101.d: "The cholera epidemic has spread despite our best efforts. Now it is also raging in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]."
 panum.101.g: "This plague is completely out of control!"
 panum.102.t: "Cholera epidemic reaches [SCOPE.sCountry('panum_infected_country').GetName]"
 panum.102.d: "We have received reports that the first cases of cholera were reported in the [SCOPE.sCountry('panum_infected_country').GetName] today. The authorities blame us for not doing enough to prevent the spread."
 panum.102.g: "This is supposed to be our fault...?"
 panum.103.t: "Cholera in Factories"
 panum.103.d: "Several factories in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] report the first cases of cholera among the workers. Local authorities are proposing regulation to combat the spread. That would have a massive impact on the industry."
 panum.103.f: "The first case of cholera occurred last week in a water mill on the outskirts of the city. Although the building was quarantined, there were further incidents further downstream in several manufactories. It is still completely unclear how the disease spread, but some local politicians agree that tough restrictions should be used to regain lost trust among the population."
 panum.103.g: "Quarantine the Factories!"
 panum.103.h: "The factories must continue to run, at all costs!"
 panum.104.t: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('disease_victim_scope').GetFullName] has contracted Cholera!"
 panum.104.d: "Just a few days ago [SCOPE.sCharacter('disease_victim_scope').GetFullName] appeared to be completely healthy, but last night [SCOPE.sCharacter('disease_victim_scope').GetSheHe] showed the first symptoms of the terrible illness that has swept over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag]. [SCOPE.sCharacter('disease_victim_scope').GetHerHis|U] health is deplorable."
 panum.104.f: "The first two waves of cholera in the 19th century also killed famous people. In Prussia, the philosopher Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel and the general August Neidhardt von Gneisenau died in the cholera epidemic of 1831. The composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is also considered a cholera victim, even though the circumstances - conscious or unconscious ingestion of contaminated water - are controversial."

 panum.105.t: "The Exodus of the Rich"
 panum.105.d: "The upper class of [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] uses its financial resources to leave the area as quickly as possible or to escape to the countryside. A lot of bribes were paid to circumvent quarantine regulations. The common people view this development with contempt."
 panum.105.f: "One of the characteristics of cholera was that it killed both rich and poor alike, making it like the plague of the Middle Ages. The influential and rich families therefore tried their best to avoid the plague. The aristocracy saw cholera as a kind of 'revolutionary disease' because it made no distinction between classes. The lax measures towards the upper class made cholera a political issue due to these social conflicts. It has often been stated that the cholera epidemics of the early 1830s in Europe and the revolutionary movements stood in a context."
 panum.105.g: "Let them go."
 panum.105.h: "There is a motive we call him THE GREAT EQUALIZER."
 panum.106.t: "Opposition tries to exploit Cholera"
 panum.106.d: "The opposition is using the epidemic to settle scores: it accuses the government of making huge mistakes in combating the epidemic."
 panum.106.f: "Because of their social and political implications, the cholera epidemics were an area in which the liberals in particular could blame the conservatives. More progressive measures and new methods were recommended as an alternative to the 'backward' elite. It should not be surprising that this cutoff between conservatives and liberals was repeated under different circumstances and with different parties."
 panum.106.g: "You're right, we're wrong. Now let's fight the epidemic!"
 panum.106.h: "This government has the situation perfectly under control."
 panum.107.t: "Mass Graves"
 panum.107.d: "Criticism of the new dug mass graves in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName] is growing. The lower class in particular sees the process as an almost mechanical process instead of proper care for the dead."
 panum.107.f: "In the wake of mass deaths and possible risks of infection, the mass burial of the dead became an unavoidable phenomenon. The fact that richer citizens could afford to have a funeral in the usual style, while the bodies of poor people were simply buried, caused social explosiveness."
 panum.107.g: "We have no time to waste with the funerals!"
 panum.107.h: "Everyone deserves a dignified burial."
 panum.108.t: "Cholera Hospitals"
 panum.108.d: "Several political parties, through their own interests, have decided to set up cholera hospitals to care for the lower class. However, they are not very popular."
 panum.108.f: "The construction of mass hospitalizations during epidemics such as cholera or tuberculosis was often controversial. The families preferred to care for their sick people at home instead of giving them away into anonymity, where they were crammed into a small space with other sick people, which is why many were convinced that they would get sick and die there. The accusation circulated that it was primarily a measure to isolate the poor from the rich and thus protect the latter."
 panum.108.g: "Beat them in the hospitals if you have to!"
 panum.108.h: "You can't force these stubborn oxen to live."
 panum.120.t: "Cholera epidemic ends"
 panum.120.d: "The whole of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag] is breathing a sigh of relief: the authorities have just reported that there are no more cases of cholera in the last disease area. The state of emergency is over. Now it's time to count the dead and return to normality."
 panum.120.f: "'May God be with me! May Heaven bless this New Year. May it be a year of fruitfulness, of peace and prosperity; may it be a year of peace and unity for all mankind; may the world be freed of cholera.' -Giacomo Meyerberr"
 panum.120.g: "But at what cost?"

 panum.200.t: "Tuberculosis in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]"
 panum.200.d: "An epidemic has broken out in one of our states: #YELLOW Tuberculosis#! is ravaging the [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]!"
 panum.200.f: "In the early Middle Ages, tuberculosis played a minor role in Europe due to the sparse population. It was only more strongly represented in the few metropolitan areas. After a previous outbreak in Italy in the second half of the 15th century, the largest and longest wave of tuberculosis in history began in the 17th century. Tuberculosis gained widespread interest in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the endemic disease of the urban poor. In 1815 a quarter of deaths in England and in 1918 in France a sixth of deaths were caused by tuberculosis. Around 1880, every second death in Germany in the 15 to 40 age group was due to this disease. Tuberculosis was also the most common cause of death in rural areas."

 panum.300.t: "Smallpox in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]"
 panum.300.d: "An epidemic has broken out in one of our states: #YELLOW Smallpox#! is ravaging the [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]!"
 panum.300.f: "Smallpox has probably been known for thousands of years and appeared in the first settlements in northeast Africa 12,000 years ago. From there they may have been brought to India by Egyptian traders. The European conquerors brought smallpox with them to America, where it caused devastating epidemics among the Indians starting in 1518, causing millions of deaths. In Europe, smallpox was sometimes considered a childhood disease, and the disease, from which up to 10% of all small children died until the end of the 18th century, was also called “children's disease”. From the 18th century onwards, cases of smallpox increased and replaced the plague as the worst disease. It is estimated that 400,000 people died of smallpox each year, and a third of those who survived went blind. Often children were only considered part of the family once they had survived smallpox. Despite the successful introduction of smallpox vaccination around 1800, smallpox remained an epidemic disease until the second half of the century."

 panum.400.d: "An epidemic has broken out in one of our states: #YELLOW Typhus#! is ravaging the [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName]!"
 panum.400.f: "Typhus fever, which probably existed in ancient times but was only reliably described in the 16th century, appeared primarily as a typical epidemic of war and misery. Typhus became a serious problem for Napoleon's army during the Russian campaign. When the Grande Armée, which had moved to Russia in June 1812, withdrew in the fall of 1813, Mainz was the first stop on French soil. 15,000-17,000 French crew and just as many civilians died there. The disease, which was then also called “nervous fever” because of the neurological symptoms it caused, remained in the French language as Typhus de Mayence. By the end of October 1814, 14,000 cases of typhus had been recorded in the Franconian area around the Grand Duchy of Würzburg, of which 2,500 were fatal. Another epidemic with around two and a half million deaths occurred as a result of war and civil war between 1918 and 1922 in Russia."
