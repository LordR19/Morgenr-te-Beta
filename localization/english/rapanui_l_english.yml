 rapanui.101.f: "The Oceanic Islands were a largely sealed-off part of the world from Western civilization in the 19th century. Missionaries had a significant part in bringing not only faith but also education and technology to these areas. Although Oceania experienced full Christianization by the mid-20th century, the missionaries initially experienced distrust and numerous failures. The cliché of the 'wild South Seas' was also derived from the fact that many missionaries found their martyrdom in the most macabre way."

 rapanui.102.d: "A missionary from a foreign land reached the shores today. Some consider him a troublemaker, others believe he could bring benefits to our country."
 rapanui.102.f: "The relationship between the Pacific island peoples and the incoming Christian missionaries was highly complicated. They were rightly seen as harbingers of colonial powers and potential destroyers of traditional culture. But in many cases, the islanders benefited from the experience and knowledge of the Europeans. Missionaries established schools, brought modern medicine with them, or introduced new methods of agriculture. For many tribes, the arrival of the missionaries marked a first step towards centralization. Of course, not all Pacific residents wanted to take this risk and made short work of uninvited guests."

 rapanui.104.f: "Unfortunately, many attempts at proselytizing ended in the killing of the respective missionary, not least because of misunderstandings and a lack of knowledge of local customs. The priest Pierre Chanel was slain on Futuna; John Williams and fellow missionary James Harris eaten by cannibals on the island of Erromango; and Carl Völkner was first beheaded in New Zealand before the chief took out his eyes and swallowed them.\nIt will take about five years after such a failure before another volunteer is found for a missionary trip. The more attempts to convert, the greater the chance that it will succeed next time."
