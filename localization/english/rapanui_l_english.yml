Missionaries had a significant part in bringing not only faith but also education and technology to these areas. Although Oceania experienced full Christianization by the mid-20th century, the missionaries initially experienced distrust and numerous failures.

 rapanui.102.d: "A missionary from a foreign land reached the shores today. Some consider him a troublemaker, others believe he could bring benefits to our country."
 rapanui.102.f: "The relationship between the Pacific island peoples and the incoming Christian missionaries was highly complicated. They were rightly seen as harbingers of colonial powers and potential destroyers of traditional culture. But in many cases, the islanders benefited from the experience and knowledge of the Europeans. Missionaries established schools, brought modern medicine with them, or introduced new methods of agriculture. For many tribes, the arrival of the missionaries marked a first step towards centralization. Of course, not all Pacific residents wanted to take this risk and made short work of uninvited guests."

 rapanui.104.f: "Unfortunately, many attempts at proselytizing ended in the killing of the respective missionary, not least because of misunderstandings and a lack of knowledge of local customs. The priest Pierre Chanel was slain on Futuna; John Williams and fellow missionary James Harris eaten by cannibals on the island of Erromango; and Carl Völkner was first beheaded in New Zealand before the chief took out his eyes and swallowed them.\nIt will take about five years after such a failure before another volunteer is found for a missionary trip.

Within one year of their arrival, the missionaries converted the islanders at Taravai, Aukena and Akamuru to Christianity, established churches, and even convinced the islanders to wear tunics.

 rapanui.123.f: "Until the second half of the 19th century, it was common for Peruvian slave traders in particular to depopulate entire islands. This type of cheap labor procurement was significantly more brutal than 'blackbirding', which was particularly widespread in northern Australia. These attacks were a burden for the missionaries, since it was not at all easy to convince the islanders to convert when nominal Christians were unscrupulous on the prowl. The abolitionism that was widespread among Catholic and Protestant clergy received new impetus from such events."

 rapanui.124.f: "The destruction of idols or holy places has always deeply shaken primitive peoples. Some saw this as proof that the Christian god must be superior to their world of gods; others saw this as a reason to fight Christianity all the more fiercely.

 rapanui.125.f: "As in many other parts of the world, ancestor worship was a central part of spiritual life. While Catholic missionaries had to struggle with the problem centuries ago and initially ignored the question of its future, Protestant missionaries in particular showed an unbelievable rigidity towards ancestor worship. Nevertheless, the worship is still widespread in some parts of Polynesia - to this day."

 rapanui.126.f: "Syncretism has always been a nuisance to missionaries. Some saw it as a transitional stage that could be overcome in a next step; Others saw in this heresy an even greater evil than the actual religion that had to be converted. Nonetheless, syncretic movements have been and still are an identity for a number of individuals, so the suppression of such a doctrine will create tension.
