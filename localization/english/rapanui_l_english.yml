Missionaries had a significant part in bringing not only faith but also education and technology to these areas. Although Oceania experienced full Christianization by the mid-20th century, the missionaries initially experienced distrust and numerous failures.

 rapanui.102.f: "The relationship between the Pacific island peoples and the incoming Christian missionaries was highly complicated. They were rightly seen as harbingers of colonial powers and potential destroyers of traditional culture. But in many cases, the islanders benefited from the experience and knowledge of the Europeans. Missionaries established schools, brought modern medicine with them, or introduced new methods of agriculture. For many tribes, the arrival of the missionaries marked a first step towards centralization. Of course, not all Pacific residents wanted to take this risk and made short work of uninvited guests."

The priest Pierre Chanel was slain on Futuna; John Williams and fellow missionary James Harris eaten by cannibals on the island of Erromango; and Carl Völkner was first beheaded in New Zealand before the chief took out his eyes and swallowed them.\nIt will take about five years after such a failure before another volunteer is found for a missionary trip.

In the Kingdom of Mangareva, French missionaries succeeded in converting large parts of the population within a very short time and baptizing the king there. Within one year of their arrival, the missionaries converted the islanders at Taravai, Aukena and Akamuru to Christianity, established churches, and even convinced the islanders to wear tunics.

 rapanui.123.f: "Until the second half of the 19th century, it was common for Peruvian slave traders in particular to depopulate entire islands. This type of cheap labor procurement was significantly more brutal than 'blackbirding', which was particularly widespread in northern Australia. These attacks were a burden for the missionaries, since it was not at all easy to convince the islanders to convert when nominal Christians were unscrupulous on the prowl. The abolitionism that was widespread among Catholic and Protestant clergy received new impetus from such events."

 rapanui.124.f: "The destruction of idols or holy places has always deeply shaken primitive peoples.

 rapanui.125.f: "As in many other parts of the world, ancestor worship was a central part of spiritual life. While Catholic missionaries had to struggle with the problem centuries ago and initially ignored the question of its future, Protestant missionaries in particular showed an unbelievable rigidity towards ancestor worship. Nevertheless, the worship is still widespread in some parts of Polynesia - to this day."

 rapanui.126.f: "Syncretism has always been a nuisance to missionaries. Some saw it as a transitional stage that could be overcome in a next step; Others saw in this heresy an even greater evil than the actual religion that had to be converted. Nonetheless, syncretic movements have been and still are an identity for a number of individuals, so the suppression of such a doctrine will create tension.

These included influenza, pneumonia, measles, mumps, scarlet fever, smallpox, whooping cough and the common cold. Traditional medicine, on the other hand, had not been able to do much.

They deified their Chiefs so that almost every village or tribe had its own Sacred Man. They exercised an extraordinary influence for evil, these village or tribal priests, and were believed to have the disposal of life and death through their sacred ceremonies. They also worshipped the spirits of departed ancestors and heroes, through their material idols of wood and stone. They feared the spirits and sought their aid; especially seeking to propitiate those who presided over war and peace, famine and plenty, health and sickness, destruction and prosperity, life and death. Their whole worship was one of slavish fear; and, so far as ever I could learn, they had no idea of a God of mercy or grace. - John G. Paton"

 rapanui.134.f: "My enemies seldom slackened their hateful designs against my life, however calmed or baffled for the moment. . . . A wild chief followed me around for four hours with his loaded musket, and, though often directed towards me, God restrained his hand. I spoke kindly to him, and attended to my work as if he had not been there, fully persuaded that my God had placed me there, and would protect me till my allotted task was finished. Looking up in unceasing prayer to our dear Lord Jesus, I left all in his hands, and felt immortal till my work was done. Trials and hairbreadth escapes strengthened my faith, and seemed only to nerve me for more to follow; and they did tread swiftly upon each other's heels. - John G. Paton"

 rapanui.138.d: "With the help of some bribed indigenous witnesses and using our missionary's rhetorical skills, we were able to inform some local clans of the malicious intentions of the competing mission station."
 rapanui.138.f: "Disagreements between rival missionary stations, particularly between protestant and catholic groups, were to form a conflict that often ended in one group being expelled by the respective ruler if he converted. In the case of Tahiti, the quarrels even led to full-scale war, as Protestant Tahiti opposed the Catholic missionaries, who in turn were under French protection. The episode was the prelude to France's military intervention in Tahiti, while Great Britain, which was considered the protector of the Tahiti it had converted, did not allow itself to be drawn into the conflict because of a few islands."

 rapanui.139.d: "Despite the best of intentions to warn our sheep - and those who are about to become one - about the malicious intentions of the competing mission station, they unfortunately didn't want to believe us. On the contrary: we are now seen as hypocritical troublemakers who want to disturb the peace on the island!"

 rapanui.151.f: "While some missionaries saw themselves in the tradition of Boniface and radically fought the peculiarities of the natives, there has always been the type of scholar who first wanted to find his way around the respective culture in order to find points of contact that he could later use to more effectively leading the natives to Christ. Last but not least, the Jesuits practiced this technique. The collections were often important for later identification, since the missionaries were the first to hand down tradition in writing. At the same time, interest in exotic cultures and their customs grew in Europe."

 rapanui.155.f: "Missionaries who were able to gain the trust of a ruler were often hired because of their education, their diplomatic contacts and, last but not least, because of the hope that a transfer of knowledge was speculated on.

Fearing an intervention, the respective ruler could try to convert to one of the two denominations, in order to at least hope for the support of the respective power should it come to a military intervention, which one was hopelessly inferior to.

 rapanui.174.f: "Even after successful missions and friendly, mutual support in local conflicts, the nation that had converted one of the South Pacific peoples did not necessarily have an interest in protecting them against other great powers. Thus, when Catholic France saw its sphere of influence there violated, Britain refrained from protecting Tahiti, which she had converted to Protestantism.

It both sharpens, and partly likewise allays that want and craving, which, as Sir J. Herschel remarks, a man experiences although every corporeal sense is fully satisfied. The excitement from the novelty of objects, and the chance of success, stimulate him to increased activity. Moreover as a number of isolated facts soon become uninteresting, the habit of comparison leads to generalization. On the other hand, as the traveller stays but a short space of time in each place, his descriptions must generally consist of mere sketches, instead of detailed observation. Hence arises, as I have found to my cost, a constant tendency to fill up the wide gaps of knowledge, by inaccurate and superficial hypotheses.' -Charles Darwin"

The research trip of the Austrian 'Novara' was to be reflected in 21 volumes. Findings from the Challenger expedition continued to be published until 1895, nineteen years after the completion of its journey, by the Challenger Office, Edinburgh, established for that purpose.

 rapanui.221.f: "The study of ocean currents was one of the fundamental sciences from which oceanography grew. As early as the Age of Discovery, Spanish and Portuguese navigators had identified potentially beneficial currents to swiftly cross the world's oceans; a well-known example of this is the trade between Manila in the Philippines and Acapulco in Mexico. In the 19th century, such oceanographic knowledge was deepened in order to obtain a better, more comprehensive picture of exactly how the global system of ocean currents worked."

 rapanui.222.f: "The water of the world's oceans is constantly in motion. The main drivers are the tides and wind. In addition, temperature and salinity differences also play an important role in the transport of seawater, since the resulting density differences cause currents. Changes in water temperature, salinity and thus also the flow speed of a current therefore also have an impact on the land masses, for example on the climate. The best-known example of this is the Gulf Stream."

 rapanui.223.f: "A travel theodolite is a geodetic theodolite designed for expeditions, which is built as small and robust as possible and whose adjustment is also possible on the go. It is known to have been used during the Austrian 'Novara Expedition'. To determine the geomagnetic parameters on land, stations were usually set up where the solid subsoil was formed by 'bricks' brought along. The series of measurements, which often lasted for hours, always had to be accompanied by astronomical location determinations. In this way, it was possible to determine the earth's magnetic field at a total of 17 locations around the globe."

 rapanui.224.f: "From the middle of the 19th century, deep-sea investigations played an increasingly important role. On the one hand, this was related to the investigation of the seabed for the laying of cables in the beginning age of telegraphy. On the other hand, physical and biological theories should be verified. For a long time there was the assumption that no living beings could exist beyond a certain water depth or that 'living fossils' would have been preserved there. Scientists like C.W. Tomson believed that the conditions of constant cold temperature, darkness, and lack of currents, waves, or seismic events provided such a stable environment that evolution would slow or stop entirely. This made deep-sea research an important field for naturalists, paleontologists and supporters of the theory of evolution."

However, there is a risk that the ship could lose valuable time should it advance too far into the ice realm. While several 19th-century expeditions ventured into sub-polar regions, even the Challenger Expedition was careful not to spend too much time in the hostile environment."

As shown by later expeditions using modern equipment, this area represents the southern end of the Mariana Trench and is one of the deepest known places on the ocean floor. Modern soundings to 6,012 fathoms (36,070 ft; 10,994 m) have since been found near the site of the Challenger's original sounding. Challenger's discovery of this depth was a key finding of the expedition in broadening oceanographic knowledge about the ocean's depth and extent and now bears the vessel's name, the Challenger Deep."

 rapanui.231.f: "Even from a distance, the crew could see that the island's beach appeared to be moving. Apparently, this was a favorite spot for green sea turtles to lay their eggs. As soon as they went ashore, some sailors wanted to allow themselves their pranks with the unsuspecting animals, whether by stealing turtle eggs or openly announcing that they finally wanted to try the famous turtle soup for themselves. However, an urgent appeal by the scientists to Commander [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_pacific_expedition_leader').GetLastName] ensured that the sailors - albeit reluctantly - abandoned their culinary ambitions."

While some scientists were collecting samples with a dinghy, such an overwhelmingly beautiful giant ray passed the bow that the academics could not believe their eyes - they only knew such an extraordinary specimen from seaman's yarn of pre-modern times. However, the message to the rest of the crew aroused ambivalent feelings. Some zoologists insisted that the best thing to do was capture the animal and transport it home in a vat of water. Other academics argued that observing the animal better in its environment in order to draw better scientific conclusions; and finally a group declared that they should leave the ray alone and continue with the sample collection. Commander [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_pacific_expedition_leader').GetLastName], on the other hand, had announced completely different plans: he suggested shooting the animal as a trophy and having it sent to [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_ruler').GetFullName] as a token of recognition - whether it is out of gratitude for the financial support from the government or for career reasons is an open question."

What Prof. Buttonholetoaster could not have guessed was that Australian red kangaroos were among the biggest rowdies in the animal kingdom, and that the Welsh settler had even understated this. And though the settler had repeatedly pointed out the bloody aftermath of Dead Cat Gully's infamous red kangaroo, it was little preparation for what Prof. Buttonholetoaster was actually to do. Eager colleagues wanted to point out in particular that before the #YELLOW [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('rapanui_expedition_ship_type')] Expedition#!, Prof. Buttonholetoaster had spent 33 years in a dingy basement at the university and was only in a tolerable condition to mess with Australia's largest land animal; the only weight training that Prof. Buttonholetoaster had done in the last few years consisted of stacking plates of crumbled cherry cake.

 rapanui.234.f: "The #YELLOW [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('rapanui_expedition_ship_type')] Expedition#! scientists quickly determined that the alleged bear was a koala and therefore a marsupial. Nevertheless: the interest of zoologists and biologists is great. There's a catch, though: the trader doesn't want money, they want another animal in exchange. He demands an ermine. The demand surprised some crew members, but the pet dealer emphasizes that weasels, ferrets and similar animals are in demand in Australia and New Zealand. The reason for this: the settlers brought in rabbits, which not only harmed the local flora and fauna, but also the farm economy, since they had no natural enemies. Now marten animals are in high demand to fight the rabbits. Could that have any consequences? The pet dealer just shrugs - and asks if we own a stoat or not."

While there was speculation as to Australia's fascinating wildlife, it had been warned that the Aborigines had previously told Europeans of fantastic animals like the bunyip, which turned out to be mere fairy tales. However, two things filled the scientists with further doubts. On the one hand, there was the requirement of the animal hunter not to touch the chimera of duck, beaver and otter, nor to get too close to it. This raised some zoologists' suspicions that it might be a stuffed creature. A biologist found out that a duck was put in an otter fur and a beaver tail was attached. The price raised a second doubt: it would take a subsidy from the capital to cover these costs. It cannot be ruled out that further demands for money were made by the animal hunter."

The oldest known fossils are mostly stromatolites, and they could therefore provide clues as to how life evolved from very simple to more complex forms. Stromatolites are considered to be the first recognizable structures built up by organisms. They originated in the Precambrian, up to 3.5 billion years ago. 3.45 billion years old is the Warrawoona series, found at the North Pole site in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. In some periods of the earth's history - long before corals existed - the stromatolite builders were important reef builders. Up until a billion years ago, stromatolites were widespread in almost all coastal waters. 700 million years ago, the diversity and distribution of stromatolites declined.

 rapanui.246.d: "A tribal chief has offered to sell us a historic amber necklace in which prehistoric insects are captured. However, Commander [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_pacific_expedition_leader').GetLastName] cannot decide how to proceed with the find."
 rapanui.246.f: "The offer from a local chief came as a surprise. Apparently the native had already heard about the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('rapanui_expedition_ship_type')]'s voyage and was hoping for good business. After the scientists took a look at the jewel, a major debate ensued as to what to do with the piece. One group insisted on purchasing it for a museum to show visitors how insects are preserved. Another group insisted on dissecting the jewel into its details and examining each fossil individually. While naturalists and paleontologists disagreed on how to deal with the clearly paleontological find, anthropologists and archaeologists objected that the piece had cultural significance. The officer corps, on the other hand, saw the scientific discussion as an unnecessary quarrel and advocated not spending money on the worthless stuff and continuing the journey."
 rapanui.246.g: "The necklace is of paleontological relevance."
 rapanui.246.h: "The necklace is of archaeological relevance."

 rapanui.247.d: "Sailors of the #YELLOW [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('rapanui_expedition_ship_type')] Expedition#! discovered an extraordinary paleontological site early in the morning. Even an amateur could see that there was something special about the place."
 rapanui.247.f: "An exposed layer of sediment revealed at first glance that the fossils were excellently preserved. In addition to the numerous finds, however, a strange bone, which soon bore the nickname 'Australian Bone', caught the attention of the sailors and the scientists who later joined them. It soon became apparent that a paleontologist with methodically correct work could probably bring more to light here than the bare hands of inexperienced workers."

It is the skeleton of a prehistoric man who lived a million years ago. A scientific sensation!"
 rapanui.250.f: "The fossils first discovered by Eugène Dubois in 1891 on the banks of the Solo River near Trinil in East Java are called Java Man. According to current knowledge, they are said to be around one million years old. They were the first fossils of hominins to be discovered outside of Europe and, after Neanderthals, the second evidence of fossil relatives of anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens). The finds from Java were first referred to as Anthropopithecus and later as Pithecanthropus erectus. Today they are assigned to the species Homo erectus by most paleoanthropologists, whereby their origin is occasionally - as suggested by Franz Weidenreich in 1940 - emphasized by the addition of a subspecies epithet: Homo erectus javanensis. More than 50 years after Dubois's find, Ralph von Koenigswald recollected that, 'No other paleontological discovery has created such a sensation and led to such a variety of conflicting scientific opinions.'"

 rapanui.251.f: "Commander [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_pacific_expedition_leader').GetLastName] had actually only wanted to make a short shore leave in order to pick up provisions and fresh water with his crew. The island, which was rather on the edge of the trade routes, apparently had little contact with the outside world. Due to a misunderstanding, however, the chief apparently assumed that the commander was a prince and presented him an artistic wooden sculpture. The crew of the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('rapanui_expedition_ship_type')] gave him the usual glass marbles, which made the native very happy."

 rapanui.252.d: "The #YELLOW [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('rapanui_expedition_ship_type')] Expedition#! was able to prove that an alleged island is just a mere peninsula and thus discovered a new bay. There is still disagreement about the naming."
 rapanui.252.f: "During its stay in the Pacific Bismarck Archipelago in August 1875, the Gazelle surveyed the natural harbor of Blanche Bay in the northeast of the island of New Britain (New Britain, formerly Neupommern). On this occasion it was recognized that the eastern part of New Britain is a peninsula, accordingly it was named 'Gazelle Peninsula' after the ship. This name has survived to this day. Furthermore, the passage between New Ireland and the island of Dyaul 'Gazelle Channel' and a natural harbor on the west coast of Bougainville's 'Gazelle Harbor' were called."

 rapanui.253.f: "When Commander [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_pacific_expedition_leader').GetLastName] entered the bay, he noticed how protected the place could be for a future expedition or trading venture. A later shore excursion revealed not only the good quality of the soil for plantation cultivation, but also a pleasant climate. Some commercial advisors immediately suggested doing everything possible to open up this location for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag]. The scientists, on the other hand, pointed out that the scientific mission could be neglected due to such imperialistic behavior."

 rapanui.254.f: "A few merchants recently came on board to give us news of the region and refresh the expedition's inventory. The conversation also turned to the Christianized and pagan cultures of the area. The ship's chaplain listened attentively and was astonished to discover that his fellow believers had not yet ventured into this area.

[SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_pacific_expedition_leader').GetLastName] is therefore considering making a deal with the natives to make the pearls available in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag] as well.

 rapanui.261.f: "Although the maps of the 19th century were already significantly better than those of the previous century, they were not without errors. Again and again islands were drawn in which did not exist; and unknown islands not entered. Even at the beginning of the 20th century, some regions of the Pacific were still incomplete or incorrectly mapped. The disappearance of the pilot Amelia Earhart in 1937 can also be explained by the fact that the Howland Islands she was aiming for was entered incorrectly by miles."

He will update the map material."
 rapanui.262.f: "The better technical prerequisites and the rhythm with which scientific expeditions took place improved the starting position for more precise distance measurements enormously. The motto is that since James Cook's last voyage, apart from the two Poles, there has been almost nothing to discover. However, how these discoveries related to each other was not always clear. With the introduction of tight schedules and deadlines in the global economy, it has become increasingly important to make not only rough measurements, but also very accurate ones."

 rapanui.263.f: "Plants from the Pacific and East Asia and their transport were not uncommon. The real reason for the 1789 Bounty Expedition, which ended in the famous mutiny, was originally to take cuttings from the breadfruit tree to grow in the Caribbean. This should provide the plantation workers with a cheap staple food to avoid starvation. In the 19th century, however, collecting and scientific research was added."

I allude to the manner in which species belonging to several of the main divisions of the animal kingdom suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks. . . . The case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the [evolutionary] views here entertained.' -Charles Darwin "

 rapanui.266.d: "Prof. [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_scientist').GetLastName] is overjoyed: he has actually collected some rare late Devonian Composita, one of the oldest life forms he ever found!"
 rapanui.266.f: "Composita is an extinct brachiopod genus that lived from the Late Devonian to the Late Permian. Composita had a cosmopolitan global distribution, having lived on every continent except Antarctica.Composita had a smooth shell with a more or less distinct fold and sulcus and a round opening for the pedicle on the pedicle valve. Composita is included in the family Athyrididae (Order Athyridida) and placed in the subfamily Spirigerellinae. Only philistines would recognize a mere shell in this time-honoured fossil."

Here he observes phenomena that he would hardly have seen in the northern hemisphere."
 rapanui.267.f: "The southern sky shows slightly more stars than the northern sky because the center of the Milky Way is about 20° south of the equator in the constellation Sagittarius. With good visibility, the southern sky includes over 2,000 fixed stars visible to the naked eye, and around 20,000 to 40,000 when using binoculars. While at the equator you can see exactly half of the southern sky and half of the northern sky at all times of the year and night, in the higher southern latitudes of South Africa or Australia you can see around two thirds of the southern sky at any time, and more than 80 percent in southern South America."

 rapanui.268.f: "From the middle of the 19th century, the astronomical societies of some industrialized nations began to organize expeditions to more distant continents to observe solar eclipses. The main focus of interest was the observation of the corona. Clues to the element helium were obtained by the French astronomer Jules Janssen in India during the total solar eclipse of August 18, 1868. The total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919 as observed from the African island of Príncipe by an expedition led by Arthur Stanley Eddington gained special attention in connection with the theory of relativity developed by Albert Einstein a few years earlier, which, among other things, predicted the deflection of the light of distant stars by the gravitational field of the sun - which was confirmed by the observations."
 rapanui.268.g: "Excellent!"
 rapanui.269.t: "Venus Transit"
 rapanui.269.d: "Astronomers have predicted a solar eclipse in the Australian-Indonesian-Pacific region in #ORANGE 1874#!. The scientific community of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag] is urging a [concept_dubois_pacific_expedition] to observe this once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event."
 rapanui.269.f: "A Venus transit is a passage of the planet Venus in front of the Sun. The apparition occurs only four times in about 243 years. Historically, the precise measurement of such passages was of great importance for determining the distance between the earth and the sun (astronomical unit) and gave rise to many expeditions and measurement campaigns by important institutes and scientists. The transit of Venus in 1874 was relatively unfavorable for astronomical measurements. It remained invisible from almost all of Europe, long transit times were only observed from Asia and short transit times from Australia, the islands of the South Pacific and the southern Indian Ocean (especially the Kerguelen Archipelago). Nevertheless, about 60 expeditions were sent out.\n\n#R Note: A Pacific expedition observing the transit of Venus must have an [concept_verrier_astronomer] on board.#!"

[SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_scientist').GetFullName] was able to make important records astronomical records that will keep science busy for years to come."
 rapanui.270.f: "The 1874 transit of Venus, which took place on 9 December 1874, was the first of the pair of transits of Venus that took place in the 19th century. As with previous transits, the 1874 transit would provide an opportunity for improved measurements and observations. Numerous expeditions were planned and sent out to observe the transit from locations around the globe, with several countries setting up official committees to organise the planning. There were six official French expeditions, five British expeditions, eight expeditions funded by the US-Congress, three German expeditions (including the 'Gazelle' expedition) and two Mexican expeditions. Italy, Russia and Austria also sent an expedition to observe this astronomical moment. The recordings of a French expedition, which put several photographs one after the other and thus put together a first 'film', became particularly famous. The transit of Venus is one of the first moving images of mankind."

It was barely visible, but what was visible of the statue suggested that it must have come from a time when a completely different era was taking place on this island - an era in which petroglyphs were not the zenith of culture or shamanistic rituals and competitions, but a culture that was able to build impressive statues and give them clear shapes. [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_adventurer_scope').GetLastName] was by no means a scientist or art connoisseur, but he had a sense of history; and the moment the Moai's hollow eyes looked at him, he looked into history.

 rapanui.1027.f: "Previous attempts to gain the trust of the locals have apparently been received as less patronizing than we first thought. Apparently the Rapa Nui elders believe that our well-meaning attempt to bribe them with cheap glass marbles might work once, but not a second time. An old woman also threw the worn sombrero at [SCOPE.sCharacter('rapanui_adventurer_scope').GetLastName]'s feet, with which we once gained their trust. This gesture was carried out in such a way that it was probably a symbol of a declaration of war - unless the group disappeared immediately."

 rapanui.1043.f: "The decision to forgo the help of the natives, to continue searching for treasure despite the lack of results, as well as the entire enterprise as such, was to turn out to be catastrophic in retrospect. After just a few days, the men were short on water and food supplies and had become more susceptible to disease.

Nautical, cartographic, meteorological, geomagnetic and biological knowledge was expanded. And for some brave adventurers, the area was no longer terra incognita."

 rapanui.413.f: "The McClure Arctic expedition, one of many attempts to find the missing Franklin expedition, was significant for being the first to successfully discover and transit the Northwest Passage, which it accomplished by both boat and sledging. However, it is precisely for this reason that it is doubtful whether this can be considered an actual passage. It was only Roald Amundsen who made the first real passage through the Northwest Passage between 1903 and 1905."

 rapanui.414.f: "In 1852 Edward Belcher was given command of the government Arctic expedition in search of Franklin. It was unsuccessful; Belcher's inability to render himself popular with his subordinates was peculiarly unfortunate on an Arctic voyage and he was not wholly suited to commanding vessels among ice. Four of the five ships (HMS Resolute, Pioneer, Assistance and Intrepid) were abandoned in pack ice, for which Belcher was court-martialled but acquitted. One of these ships, HMS Resolute, was eventually recovered intact by an American whaler and returned to the United Kingdom."

The expedition failed disastrously; From 1845 to 1848 everyone involved died in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The last traces of the expedition members were only discovered many years later near King William Island. The tragic fate of the Franklin expedition, long obscured, attracted widespread attention in the mid-19th century. Newspapers achieved high circulation with reports and speculations about Franklin's fate and exploited the topic according to all the rules of modern mass media.
