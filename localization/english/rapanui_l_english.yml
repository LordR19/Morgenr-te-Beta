 rapanui.101.f: "The Oceanic Islands were a largely sealed-off part of the world from Western civilization in the 19th century. Missionaries had a significant part in bringing not only faith but also education and technology to these areas. Although Oceania experienced full Christianization by the mid-20th century, the missionaries initially experienced distrust and numerous failures. The cliché of the 'wild South Seas' was also derived from the fact that many missionaries found their martyrdom in the most macabre way."

 rapanui.102.d: "A missionary from a foreign land reached the shores today. Some consider him a troublemaker, others believe he could bring benefits to our country."
 rapanui.102.f: "The relationship between the Pacific island peoples and the incoming Christian missionaries was highly complicated. They were rightly seen as harbingers of colonial powers and potential destroyers of traditional culture. But in many cases, the islanders benefited from the experience and knowledge of the Europeans. Missionaries established schools, brought modern medicine with them, or introduced new methods of agriculture. For many tribes, the arrival of the missionaries marked a first step towards centralization. Of course, not all Pacific residents wanted to take this risk and made short work of uninvited guests."

 rapanui.104.f: "Unfortunately, many attempts at proselytizing ended in the killing of the respective missionary, not least because of misunderstandings and a lack of knowledge of local customs. The priest Pierre Chanel was slain on Futuna; John Williams and fellow missionary James Harris eaten by cannibals on the island of Erromango; and Carl Völkner was first beheaded in New Zealand before the chief took out his eyes and swallowed them.\nIt will take about five years after such a failure before another volunteer is found for a missionary trip.

In addition to hostility or fear, some residents also showed spontaneous interest. In the Kingdom of Mangareva, French missionaries succeeded in converting large parts of the population within a very short time and baptizing the king there. Within one year of their arrival, the missionaries converted the islanders at Taravai, Aukena and Akamuru to Christianity, established churches, and even convinced the islanders to wear tunics.

 rapanui.114.f: "Missionary work often requires a proper balance of tough enforcement and elegant diplomacy. In many cases, an overzealous missionary has passed away before he could complete his work.

In this case, the latter happened to our missionary."
 rapanui.115.t: "Catholic mission abolished"

 rapanui.123.f: "Until the second half of the 19th century, it was common for Peruvian slave traders in particular to depopulate entire islands. This type of cheap labor procurement was significantly more brutal than 'blackbirding', which was particularly widespread in northern Australia. These attacks were a burden for the missionaries, since it was not at all easy to convince the islanders to convert when nominal Christians were unscrupulous on the prowl. The abolitionism that was widespread among Catholic and Protestant clergy received new impetus from such events."

 rapanui.124.f: "The destruction of idols or holy places has always deeply shaken primitive peoples. Some saw this as proof that the Christian god must be superior to their world of gods; others saw this as a reason to fight Christianity all the more fiercely. Some art lovers have pointed out that the pagan images might be better off elsewhere."

 rapanui.125.f: "As in many other parts of the world, ancestor worship was a central part of spiritual life. While Catholic missionaries had to struggle with the problem centuries ago and initially ignored the question of its future, Protestant missionaries in particular showed an unbelievable rigidity towards ancestor worship. Nevertheless, the worship is still widespread in some parts of Polynesia - to this day."

 rapanui.126.f: "Syncretism has always been a nuisance to missionaries. Some saw it as a transitional stage that could be overcome in a next step; Others saw in this heresy an even greater evil than the actual religion that had to be converted. Nonetheless, syncretic movements have been and still are an identity for a number of individuals, so the suppression of such a doctrine will create tension. The fact that such phenomena also have interesting cultural and artistic characteristics has always fascinated anthropologists and art lovers."

These included influenza, pneumonia, measles, mumps, scarlet fever, smallpox, whooping cough and the common cold. Traditional medicine, on the other hand, had not been able to do much.

In Fiji, 79,000 Cannibals have been brought under the influence of the Gospel; and 13,000 members of the Churches are professing to live and work for Jesus. In Samoa, 34,000 Cannibals have professed Christianity; and in nineteen years, its College has sent forth 206 Native teachers and evangelists. On our New Hebrides, more than 12,000 Cannibals have been brought to sit at the feet of Christ, through I mean not to say that they are all model Christians; and 133 of the Natives have been trained and sent forth as teachers and preachers of the Gospel.' - John G.

 rapanui.133.f: "Their worship was entirely a service of fear, its aim being to propitiate this or that Evil spirit, to prevent calamity or to secure revenge. They deified their Chiefs so that almost every village or tribe had its own Sacred Man. They exercised an extraordinary influence for evil, these village or tribal priests, and were believed to have the disposal of life and death through their sacred ceremonies. They also worshipped the spirits of departed ancestors and heroes, through their material idols of wood and stone. They feared the spirits and sought their aid; especially seeking to propitiate those who presided over war and peace, famine and plenty, health and sickness, destruction and prosperity, life and death. Their whole worship was one of slavish fear; and, so far as ever I could learn, they had no idea of a God of mercy or grace. - John G. Paton"

 rapanui.134.t: "Incompetent Missionaries?"
 rapanui.134.d: "Despite a new group of missionaries we sent to [SCOPE.sCountry('rapanui_mission_country').GetNameNoFlag], our conversion efforts were only marginally successful."
 rapanui.134.f: "My enemies seldom slackened their hateful designs against my life, however calmed or baffled for the moment. . . . A wild chief followed me around for four hours with his loaded musket, and, though often directed towards me, God restrained his hand. I spoke kindly to him, and attended to my work as if he had not been there, fully persuaded that my God had placed me there, and would protect me till my allotted task was finished. Looking up in unceasing prayer to our dear Lord Jesus, I left all in his hands, and felt immortal till my work was done. Trials and hairbreadth escapes strengthened my faith, and seemed only to nerve me for more to follow; and they did tread swiftly upon each other's heels. - John G. Paton"

 rapanui.135.t: "Trade with Natives"
 rapanui.135.d: "After making contact with the local ruler, the question is what to trade with him; he offers a valuable artifact, an exotic animal, or precious pearls."

 rapanui.135.i: "We like the pearls."

 rapanui.138.t: "Discredition worked"
 rapanui.138.d: "With the help of some bribed indigenous witnesses and using our missionary's rhetorical skills, we were able to inform some local clans of the malicious intentions of the competing mission station."
 rapanui.138.f: "Disagreements between rival missionary stations, particularly between protestant and catholic groups, were to form a conflict that often ended in one group being expelled by the respective ruler if he converted. In the case of Tahiti, the quarrels even led to full-scale war, as Protestant Tahiti opposed the Catholic missionaries, who in turn were under French protection. The episode was the prelude to France's military intervention in Tahiti, while Great Britain, which was considered the protector of the Tahiti it had converted, did not allow itself to be drawn into the conflict because of a few islands."
 rapanui.139.t: "Discredition backfires"
 rapanui.139.d: "Despite the best of intentions to warn our sheep - and those who are about to become one - about the malicious intentions of the competing mission station, they unfortunately didn't want to believe us. On the contrary: we are now seen as hypocritical troublemakers who want to disturb the peace on the island!"

 rapanui.151.f: "While some missionaries saw themselves in the tradition of Boniface and radically fought the peculiarities of the natives, there has always been the type of scholar who first wanted to find his way around the respective culture in order to find points of contact that he could later use to more effectively leading the natives to Christ. Last but not least, the Jesuits practiced this technique. The collections were often important for later identification, since the missionaries were the first to hand down tradition in writing. At the same time, interest in exotic cultures and their customs grew in Europe."

 rapanui.152.f: "Christian schools made an important contribution to gradually bringing Oceania, which was isolated from the rest of the world, to the school tradition prevailing in the West, and thus to promoting literacy among the autochthonous population. Along with the end of cannibalism and tribal feuds, the introduction of schools is considered one of the great positive side effects of missionary work."

 rapanui.155.f: "Missionaries who were able to gain the trust of a ruler were often hired because of their education, their diplomatic contacts and, last but not least, because of the hope that a transfer of knowledge was speculated on. This did not necessarily mean a real will to convert, but at least meant a greater position of power for the country from which the missionary came - much to the displeasure of rival cofnesses who hoped to establish shadow protectorates by influencing a ruler."

 rapanui.171.f: "At a certain point, disagreements between different denominational missionaries could degenerate into a political conflict. The best-known example of this is Tahiti. Fearing an intervention, the respective ruler could try to convert to one of the two denominations, in order to at least hope for the support of the respective power should it come to a military intervention, which one was hopelessly inferior to. The Protector's protection wasn't secure, but it offered at least a chance of survival rather than being reduced to a mere colony."

Our ambitions to permanently convert the island nation to the true faith and exert influence there were dealt a hard blow; but the situation is not completely hopeless. The matter offers us an excellent pretext to intervene directly militarily in [SCOPE.sCountry('rapanui_mission_country').GetNameNoFlag] and to enforce our ideas - politically and religiously.

In any case, our competitor is showing its teeth. With that, owning [SCOPE.sCountry('rapanui_mission_country').GetNameNoFlag] could become a matter of national honor."

 rapanui.174.t: "The unprotective Protector"
 rapanui.174.d: "Our supposed 'protective power' found it too dangerous to protect us in the coming war."
 rapanui.174.f: "Even after successful missions and friendly, mutual support in local conflicts, the nation that had converted one of the South Pacific peoples did not necessarily have an interest in protecting them against other great powers. Thus, when Catholic France saw its sphere of influence there violated, Britain refrained from protecting Tahiti, which she had converted to Protestantism. London recognized the claims of the French - also because it didn't want to start a world war over a few remote islands."

 #Missionary Deaths
 rapanui_custom_death_shot_arrows: "[ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] had approached the island several times in a small boat and was greeted by a hail of arrows each time. The natives didn't seem to want to hit [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]  with the arrows and instead just chased him away. By the third attempt, they were apparently tired of [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] attempts. Several arrows hit [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] and [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] slumped down lifeless."
 rapanui_custom_death_lunch: "At the beginning, everything seemed to go well. [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] was warmly received by the natives. They even offered [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim] a feast in his honor. But apparently [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] had not translated the native language so well. [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was not to attend a banquet, no, [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was the banquet."
 rapanui_custom_death_burnt: "Somehow [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] must have angered the natives. Shortly after his arrival, the crew of the ship in which he had reached the coast saw a large bonfire on the beach. When they did not hear from [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] for days, they decided to investigate. On the beach they found the burned remains of [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], identified only by the cross [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] always kept with [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]."
 rapanui_custom_death_shipwrecked: "Tragedy! Before [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] even arrived at [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHis] destination, [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName], the ship he was on was caught in a storm and sank into the ocean. All the passengers except [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] survived. Was this a sign from God?"
 rapanui_custom_death_clubbed: "Only shortly after [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] stepped ashore, [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] was circled by the locals. At first they seemed very interested in [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim], but shortly after a big scuffle started. In the process, the islanders beat [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] with large clubs until [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] lay motionless on the ground."
 rapanui_custom_death_beheaded: "Just one day after [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] landed on the island, the crew of the ship he arrived on made a terrible discovery. On the beach they found the severed head of [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] on a spike. No one knows why the locals did this to [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]."
 rapanui_custom_death_join_natives: "For several weeks nothing had been heard from [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName]. So a group was sent to investigate the village that [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetSheHe] had visited to find out what had happened to [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetHerHim]. As it turned out, everything was fine with [ROOT.Var('rapanui_missionary_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName]. Only he had decided to join these savages. How could this have happened?"
