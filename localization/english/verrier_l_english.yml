 verrier_physics_tech: "Classical Physics"
 verrier_physics_tech_desc: "Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics. Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies (determined by Kepler between 1609 and 1619), Galileo's pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Isaac Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation (that would come to bear his name)."
 verrier_astronomy_tech: "Modern Astronomy"
 verrier_astronomy_tech_desc: "During the 18-19th centuries, the study of the three-body problem by Leonhard Euler, Alexis Claude Clairaut, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Pierre Simon Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations."
 verrier_electromagnetism_tech: "Electromagnetism"
 verrier_electromagnetism_tech_desc: "In 1864 James Clerk Maxwell of Edinburgh announced his electromagnetic theory of light, which was perhaps the greatest single step in the world's knowledge of electricity. Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light obviously involved the existence of electric waves in free space, and his followers set themselves the task of experimentally demonstrating the truth of the theory. The discovery of electromagnetic waves in space led to the development of radio in the closing years of the 19th century."
 verrier_astro_physics_tech: "Modern Physics"
 verrier_astro_physics_tech_desc: "Modern physics is a branch of physics that developed in the early 20th century. Notable branches of modern physics include quantum mechanics, special relativity and general relativity. It is concerned with extreme conditions, such as high velocities that are comparable to the speed of light, small distances comparable to the atomic radius, and very high energies."
 verrier_chemistry_tech: "Inorganic Chemistry"
 verrier_chemistry_tech_desc: "The development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by Alessandro Volta. ritish William Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. J.A.R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements."
  
 je_verrier_neptune: "The Unknown Planet"
 je_verrier_neptune_reason: "In 1821, Alexis Bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus, making predictions of future positions based on Newton's laws of motion and gravitation. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesize some perturbing body. These irregularities, both in the planet's ecliptic longitude and in its radius vector (its distance from the Sun), could have been explained by several hypotheses: the effect of the Sun's gravity at such a great distance might differ from Newton's description; or the discrepancies might simply be observational error; or perhaps Uranus was being pulled, or perturbed, by an undiscovered planet. John Couch Adams learned of these irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the perturbation hypothesis. Adams believed that he could use the observed data on Uranus and Newton's law of gravitation to deduce the mass, position, and orbit of the perturbing body. Meanwhile, on 10 November 1845, Urbain Le Verrier presented to the Académie des sciences in Paris a memoir on Uranus and showed that the pre-existing theory failed to account for its motion. Unaware of Adams's work, he attempted a similar investigation, and on 1 June 1846, in a second memoir presented to a public meeting of the Académie, he gave the position, but not the mass or orbit, of the proposed perturbing body. Le Verrier located the unknown planet within one degree of its discovery position. Le Verrier was unaware that his public confirmation of Adams' private computations had set in motion a British search for the purported planet. On 31 August, Le Verrier presented a third memoir, now giving the mass and orbit of the new body. Now it was only a matter of finding the celestial body and thereby proving its existence."

 je_verrier_pluto: "Planet X"
 je_verrier_pluto_reason: "In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune. In 1906, Percival Lowell - a wealthy Bostonian who had founded Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894 - started an extensive project in search of a possible unknown planet, which he termed 'Planet X'. By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet. Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Planet X on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were. Percival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929. Vesto Melvin Slipher, the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old Clyde Tombaugh, who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings. Tombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates."

 je_verrier_charter_moon: "Map the Moon"
 je_verrier_charter_moon_reason: "Selenography is the study of the surface and physical features of the Moon (also known as geography of the Moon, or selenodesy). Like geography and areography, selenography is a subdiscipline within the field of planetary science. Historically, the principal concern of selenographists was the mapping and naming of the lunar terrane identifying maria, craters, mountain ranges, and other various features. Lunar mapping became systematic in 1779 when Johann Schröter began meticulous observation and measurement of lunar topography. In 1834 Johann Heinrich von Mädler published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published The Universal Selenography. All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when J.W. Draper, using a 5 inch reflector, produced a daguerreotype of the Moon and thus introduced photography to astronomy. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the telescope 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of astronomy."

 verrier_found_observatory_decision_desc: "In the 19th century, astronomy made enormous progress, not least because of the patronage of the nation states. The hunt for celestial bodies was also started because the naming of new stars, planets or asteroids secured prestige for countries and rulers. With ever newer methods, such as the modernization of telescopes or the introduction of photography, the yield increased immensely. Building an observatory will result in passive discovery of new celestial bodies every year; the exact number can be checked in the observatory itself, when it is completed. New technologies and an [concept_verrier_astronomer] improve the statistics."

 verrier_asteroid_congress_decision: "Astronomical Congress on Asteroids"
 verrier_asteroid_congress_decision_desc: "Since the discovery of Ceres in 1801, astronomers have found more and more celestial bodies, which is why the number of planets in the solar system has continued to increase. The discovery of Neptune raised the question of whether a new category might make more sense for the numerous, smaller objects found particularly between Mars and Jupiter. In particular, the invention of new astronomical symbols and their relatively small size led astronomers to assume that they were more likely 'small stars' or 'small planets'. Of course, this categorization would mean that some of the objects previously considered planets would lose their status and would be degraded to mere boulders."
 verrier_asteroid_congress_decision_tt: "The more celestial bodies are found, the more urgent a reform of the previous definition of planets becomes. With more than #BLUE 1,500#! objects, the situation is likely to become so confusing that a conference becomes unavoidable."
 verrier_carte_congress_decision: "Carte du Ciel"
 verrier_carte_congress_decision_desc: "A vast and unprecedented international star-mapping project was initiated in 1887 by Paris Observatory director Amédée Mouchez, who realized the potential of the new dry plate photographic process to revolutionize the process of making maps of the stars. As a result of the Astrographic Congress of more than 50 astronomers held in Paris in April 1887, 20 observatories from around the world agreed to participate in the project. We can host such a congress to share the astronomical knowledge of the international community."
 verrier_great_debate_decision: "The Great Debate"
 verrier_great_debate_decision_desc: "The Shapley-Curtis Debate, also known as The Great Debate, bundled the early 20th century discussions that eventually led to a new understanding of the nature of galaxies and the size of the Universe. It revolved around the size of the Milky Way and whether the galaxies then known as spiral nebulae are small objects in the Milky Way or much more distant and separate from the Milky Way. That day, the two scientists presented independent technical papers on the size scale of the Universe, followed by a public discussion in the evening. We can hold such a congress to discuss the ultimate mysteries of the universe."

In addition to some new objects, the 'planets' Pallas, Vesta, Juno and Astraea discovered from 1801 onwards are also classified as asteroids. Ceres remains a planet."

 verrier.35.t: "A disputed planetary status"
 verrier.35.d: "A recent statement from an astronomical congress has implications for our nation's prestige."
 verrier.35.f: "Several objections have not helped. Depriving one or more of the planets we discovered of planetary status has a negative impact on our standing in the world. Almost everyone can find an asteroid in the present; nothing about it brings international recognition. We used to boast that one of our scientists had discovered such a celestial body, but with the latest decision such vanities no longer matter."
 verrier.35.g: "This vote was clearly manipulated!"
  
 verrier.40.t: "Comet sighted!"
 verrier.40.d: "Scientists from our observatory have discovered a new comet."
 verrier.40.f: "A Comet was sighted in the sky, some believe that this portends fell times ahead. Others believe that they are in fact pixie fairies floating in the sky. There are also those who believe that this comet is most probably a giant ball of ice floating thorugh the sky and the long tail is created du to the energy of the sun. The arguments among the three equally viable theories is stimulating the pursuit of knowledge in our country."
 verrier.40.g: "Thank God we live in such enlightened times."
 verrier.41.t: "A new Asteroid"
 verrier.41.d: "Astronomers have discovered a new celestial body in the asteroid and added it to our star charts."
 verrier.41.f: "In the course of the 19th century, the mapping of celestial bodies, especially asteroids, gained tremendous momentum. While scientists had only discovered a dozen asteroids by around 1850, there were around 300 by the turn of the century. Among other things, these discoveries were responsible for rethinking previous categories and creating new ones."
 verrier.41.g: "How many more?"
 verrier.42.t: "Meteor Shower"
 verrier.42.d: "A seasonal meteor shower allows our astronomers to see a particularly large number of astronomical objects this year."
 verrier.42.f: "A meteor shower is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the Earth's surface. Very intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which produce at least 1,000 meteors an hour, most notably from the Leonids."
 verrier.42.g: "Hopefully the sky is clear and visibility is good!"
 verrier.43.t: "Nebula"
 verrier.43.d: "Our observatory has found a previously unknown beautiful nebula with numerous unknown stars."
 verrier.43.f: "The first true nebula, as distinct from a star cluster, was mentioned by the Muslim Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi. He noted 'a little cloud' where the Andromeda Galaxy is located. From 1751 to 1753, Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille cataloged 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope, most of which were previously unknown. The number of nebulae was then greatly increased by the efforts of William Herschel and his sister Caroline Herschel, whoroughly 2,000 nebulae. Beginning in 1864, William Huggins examined the spectra of about 70 nebulae. About 1923, following the Great Debate, it had become clear that many 'nebulae' were in fact galaxies far from the Milky Way."
 verrier.43.g: "Wonderful!"
 verrier.44.t: "Naming a star"
 verrier.44.d: "Rather by accident, [SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_star_discoverer').GetFullName] discovered a new star. At the moment it is still being debated after whom or what it should be named."
 verrier.44.f: "While astronomers initially followed the unwritten rule of naming celestial objects after mythological models, the fashion of using the name of a ruler or evoking associations with the home country emerged, as in the case of unknown parts of the world. The planet Uranus, for example, was first to be named 'George' after the reigning British king at the time. Piazzi added the epithet 'Ferdinandea' after his patron and ruler when he discovered Ceres."
 verrier.44.g: "The star should be named after our country."

 verrier.45.f: "Up until the present day, a number of amateur astronomers have rendered outstanding service and have advanced astronomy as a science. The countless amount of objects has repeatedly meant that scientific dilettantes have also been able to help learned experts with their records. Not surprising, because some famous astronomers often started out as passionate stargazers."

 verrier.45.h: "The studies are interesting, nothing more, nothing less."
 verrier.46.t: "Star maps wrong"
 verrier.46.d: "Unfortunately, after reviewing older star maps, we found that some of the mapped stars do not exist at all."
 verrier.46.f: "Unfortunately, errors in astronomical records are not uncommon. This was true not only for the early modern period, but even for the 19th century, despite improved and refined methods. For example, in 1861 Hermann Goldschmidt claimed to have found another moon of Saturn, which he named 'Chiron', but whose existence could never be confirmed."
 verrier.46.g: "Are you saying it was just dirt on the telescope?"
 verrier.47.t: "New moons of Saturn discovered"
 verrier.47.d: "After upgrading the telescope at one of our main observatories, our astronomers were able to discover two new moons of Saturn."
 verrier.47.f: "The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets only tens of meters across to enormous Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury. Saturn has 83 moons with confirmed orbits that are not embedded in its rings. as well as dense rings that contain millions of embedded moonlets and innumerable smaller ring particles. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those, Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Particularly notable among Saturn's moons is Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede."
 verrier.47.g: "Excellent."
 verrier.48.t: "Incredible Nova!"
 verrier.48.d: "Our [concept_verrier_astronomer], Dr. [ROOT.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName], discovered a new Nova far brighter than its surrounding stars. Such sightings are incredibly rare and usually limited to the best astronomers."
 verrier.48.f: "We were the first to notice the appearance of the Nova. But soon many other observatories started pointing their telescopes to it. The Nova was far brighter than the surrounding stars and lasted for nearly two weeks. Although it faded over time, it was clearly visible for quite some time. We do not know yet, why it happened but the observation will surely help us to understand this phenomenon better!"
 verrier.48.g: "Incredible"
  
 verrier.50.t: "Map of the Moon"
 verrier.50.d: "After many years of intensive observation and mapping, as well as using state-of-the-art photography, our astronomers have been able to create an accurate map of the moon."
 verrier.50.f: "Lunar mapping became systematic in 1779 when Johann Schröter began meticulous observation and measurement of lunar topography. In 1834 Johann Heinrich von Mädler published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published The Universal Selenography. All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when J.W. Draper, using a 5 inch reflector, produced a daguerreotype of the Moon and thus introduced photography to astronomy. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the telescope 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of astronomy."
 verrier.50.g: "Superb."
 verrier.51.t: "Lunar channel"
 verrier.51.d: "The project to map the moon photographically has made progress."
 verrier.51.f: "Rille is typically used to describe any of the long, narrow depressions in the surface of the Moon that resemble channels. The Latin term is rima, plural rimae. Typically, a rille can be several kilometers wide and hundreds of kilometers in length. However, the term has also been used loosely to describe similar structures on a number of planets in the Solar System, including Mars, Venus, and on a number of moons. All bear a structural resemblance to each other."
 verrier.51.g: "Fascinating."
 verrier.52.t: "Lunar crater"
 verrier.52.f: "The cratering records of very old surfaces - such as the Moon - record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago. Because the processes of erosion on the Moon are minimal, craters persist. In 1893, Grove Karl Gilbert suggested for the first time that the Moon's craters were formed by large asteroid impacts."
 verrier.53.t: "Lunar maria"
 verrier.53.f: "The lunar maria are large, dark, basaltic plains on Earth's Moon, formed by ancient asteroid impacts on the far side on the Moon that triggered volcanic activity on the opposite (near) side. They were dubbed maria, Latin for 'seas', by early astronomers who mistook them for actual seas. They are less reflective than the "highlands" as a result of their iron-rich composition, and hence appear dark to the naked eye. The maria cover about 16% of the lunar surface, mostly on the side visible from Earth. The few maria on the far side are much smaller, residing mostly in very large craters. The traditional nomenclature for the Moon also includes one oceanus (ocean), as well as features with the names lacus ('lake'), palus ('marsh'), and sinus ('bay'). The last three are smaller than maria, but have the same nature and characteristics."
 verrier.54.t: "Lunar highlands"
 verrier.54.f: "The lighter-colored regions of the Moon are called terrae, or more commonly highlands, because they are higher than most maria. They have been dated to having formed 4.4 billion years ago, and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean. The concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after the Moon's formation."

It was discovered on February 5, 1843, and rapidly brightened to become a great comet. It was a member of the Kreutz Sungrazers, a family of comets resulting from the breakup of a parent comet into multiple fragments in about 1106. These comets pass extremely close to the surface of the Sun - within a few solar radii - and often become very bright as a result. It passed closest to Earth on March 6, 1843, and was at its greatest brilliance the following day; unfortunately for observers north of the equator, at its peak it was best visible from the Southern Hemisphere. It was last observed on April 19, 1843. At that time this comet had passed closer to the Sun than any other known object."

It was nearest the Earth on October 10, 1858, and for much of October was a brilliant object with a long, scimitar-like dust tail and prominent gas tail. It remained a naked-eye object until November for Southern Hemisphere observers. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful comets observed, and was one of the brightest of the century, making a strong impression both on artists and the general public. After a prior period of hysteria on the subject of comets, especially in Paris (caused partly by incorrect calculations by John Russell Hind which suggested that one would strike the Earth in June 1857) it went on to be the most-observed of the century due to its excellent visibility in dark skies for Northern Hemisphere viewers, particularly in Europe, and fine weather in September and October. William Henry Smyth, an English astronomer, recalled it as 'one of the most beautiful objects that I have ever seen'. It was featured in a number of sketches and at least one painting by William Turner of Oxford."

In my marine telescope the object appeared much diffused, and it was with the greatest difficulty that I estimated its distance from three well known fixed stars. The object was hardly distinguishable in the small telescope attached to the sextant, and I found it necessary to employ a coloured glass between the index and horizon glasses, for the superior brilliance of the reference stars Procyon, Sirius, and Canopus, when they were brought into the field of view, quite extinguished its feeble light. Every comet hunter knows how necessary it is to the carrying out of his work to have at hand a copious catalogue of nebulae, but this valuable adjunct I unfortunately did not possess. I could not, however, find the object in the limited catalogues at my command. I accordingly made up my mind to watch it, and it is well that I did so, otherwise I should have missed one of the best opportunities for introducing myself to the astronomical world.'"

 verrier.88.f: "Shapley was arguing in favor of the Milky Way as the entirety of the universe. He believed that 'spiral nebulae' such as Andromeda were simply part of the Milky Way. He could back up this claim by citing relative sizes - if Andromeda were not part of the Milky Way, then its distance must have been on the order of 100,000,000 light years - a span most contemporary astronomers would not accept. Curtis, on the other hand, contended that Andromeda and other such 'nebulae' were separate galaxies, or 'island universes' (a term invented by the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant, who also believed that the 'spiral nebulae' were extragalactic). He showed that there were more novae in Andromeda than in the Milky Way. From this, he could ask why there were more novae in one small section of the galaxy than the other sections of the galaxy, if Andromeda were not a separate galaxy but simply a nebula within Earth's galaxy. This led to supporting Andromeda as a separate galaxy with its own signature age and rate of nova occurrences."

These four papers were major contributions to the foundation of modern physics. They revolutionized science's understanding of the fundamental concepts of space, time, mass, and energy. The first paper explained the photoelectric effect, the second paper explained Brownian motion. The third paper introduced Einstein's theory of special relativity, which established the universal constant speed of light for all reference frames and a theory of spacetime. The fourth, a consequence of the theory of special relativity, developed the principle of mass-energy equivalence, expressed in the famous equation E = mc^2 and which led to the discovery and use of atomic energy.

Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year.  In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life.  In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany.

 verrier.93.f: "General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. Einstein's theory has astrophysical implications, including the prediction of black holes - regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.

However, his political views were of public interest through the middle of the 20th century due to his fame and involvement in political, humanitarian, and academic projects around the world. Einstein was a proponent of civil rights and used his notoriety to condemn American discrimination. When he arrived in America, he objected to the mistreatment of African Americans.  Einstein, who had experienced heavy anti-Semitic discrimination in pre-World War II Germany, worked with a number of leading civil rights activists and civil rights organizations. He was in favour of socialism, especially in his later life, detailing his economic views in a 1949 article titled 'Why Socialism?' for the Monthly Review. His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time.

Halley's periodic returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers around the world since at least 240 BC. But it was not until 1705 that the English astronomer Edmond Halley understood that these appearances were reappearances of the same comet. As a result of this discovery, the comet is named after Halley. The 1910 approach was notable for several reasons: it was the first approach of which photographs exist, and the first for which spectroscopic data were obtained. American satirist and writer Mark Twain was born on 30 November 1835, exactly two weeks after the comet's perihelion. In his autobiography, published in 1909, he said: ' came in with Halley's comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don't go out with Halley's comet. The Almighty has said, no doubt: 'Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.'

He was the first to theorize that the recession of nearby galaxies can be explained by an expanding universe, which was observationally confirmed soon afterwards by Edwin Hubble. He first derived 'Hubble's law', now called the Hubble–Lemaître law by the IAU, and published the first estimation of the Hubble constant in 1927, two years before Hubble's article. Lemaître also proposed the 'Big Bang theory' of the origin of the universe, calling it the 'hypothesis of the primeval atom', and later calling it 'the beginning of the world'. Under the title 'A homogeneous Universe of constant mass and growing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extragalactic nebulae' (1927), that was later to bring him international fame, he presented the new idea that the universe is expanding, which he derived from General Relativity."

Physicists now call these quanta photons. This assumption, incompatible with classical physics, is regarded as the birth of quantum physics and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of Planck's career. The discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units, all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based. In recognition of Planck's fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1918."

 verrier.117.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_new_astronomer_scope').GetFullName] was an American astronomer. He played a crucial role in establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology. Hubble provided evidence that the recessional velocity of a galaxy increases with its distance from the Earth, a property now known as 'Hubble's law', although it had been proposed two years earlier by Georges Lemaître. Using the Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson, Hubble identified Cepheid variables, a standard candle discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. Comparing their apparent luminosity to their intrinsic luminosity gives their distance from Earth. Hubble found Cephieds in several nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum Nebula. His observations, made in 1924, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside our own, thus today they are no longer considered nebula. Hubble also devised the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, grouping them according to their appearance in photographic images. He arranged the different groups of galaxies in what became known as the Hubble sequence."

Apart from his work in his homeland, he spent a substantial amount of his career abroad, in both Canada and the United Kingdom. In early work, Rutherford discovered the concept of radioactive half-life, the radioactive element radon, and differentiated and named alpha and beta radiation. It is the basis for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry he was awarded in 1908 'for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances'. Rutherford moved to the UK, where he and Thomas Royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. Later he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. He performed the first artificially induced nuclear reaction in experiments where nitrogen nuclei were bombarded with alpha particles. As a result, he discovered the emission of a subatomic particle which he named the proton."

 verrier.119.f: "In 1863, there were 56 known elements with a new element being discovered at a rate of approximately one per year. Other scientists had previously identified periodicity of elements. After becoming a teacher in 1867, Mendeleev wrote 'Principles of Chemistry', which became the definitive textbook of its time. It was published in two volumes between 1868 and 1870, and Mendeleev wrote it as he was preparing a textbook for his course. As he attempted to classify the elements according to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led him to postulate his periodic table; he claimed to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream: 'I saw in a dream a table where all elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper, only in one place did a correction later seem necessary.' By adding additional elements following this pattern, Mendeleev developed his extended version of the periodic table. Mendeleev published his periodic table of all known elements and predicted several new elements to complete the table in a Russian-language journal."

The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranus's orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton. Le Verrier sent the coordinates to Johann Gottfried Galle in Berlin, asking him to verify. Galle found Neptune in the same night he received Le Verrier's letter, within 1° of the predicted position. After that Le Verrier took on the task to '... embrace in a single work the entire planetary system, put everything in harmony if possible, otherwise, declare with certainty that there are as yet unknown causes of perturbations...', a work which would occupy him for the rest of his life. Le Verrier began by re-evaluating, to the 7th order, the technique of calculating the planetary perturbations known as the perturbing function. This derivation, which resulted in 469 mathematical terms, was complete by 1849. He next collected observations of the positions of the planets as far back as 1750. Examining these and correcting for inconsistencies with the most recent data occupied him until 1852.

The King of Prussia awarded him an annual pension of 1,200 marks for the discovery. The discovery of Astraea should be the prelude to further discoveries in the asteroid belt and was the last major discovery of a celestial body before the discovery of Neptune. At the same time, 'Astraea' caused doubts to grow as to whether such small objects in space actually deserved the name 'planet'. At that time, Alexander von Humboldt suggested grouping the celestial bodies into their own category: the asteroid."

This was after years of lobbying by Greek astronomer Georgios Konstantinos Vouris, who was probably the most well known Greek scientist of his time.\n   As Vouris lived in Austria for quite some time he had good connections to Austrians and Greeks alike.

His replacement, Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt, expanded the library of the observatory and observed many astronomical objects. One of his focuses was the Moon. His main work, the Chaptre der Gebirge des Mondes (The Topographical Chart of the Moon) featured the whole observable surface of the Moon as precise drawings. He also noticed that the crater Linne showed morphological changes.\n   Schmidt released works about earthquakes and meteorology as well and tried to locate Troy.\n\n   The Observatory on the hill of the Nymphs is still in use but there are three more sites that are part of the National Observatory of Athens, the Penteli Astronomical Station, the Kryoneri Astronomical Station and the Chelmos Observatory."

The building was constructed by Gottfried Semper, a German architect who had to flee from repression in Saxony.\n\n   #b Historically, #! The Eidgenössische Sternwarte was built between 1862 and 1864 by Gottfried Semper who was the first professor of architecture at the Polytechnikum. He planned the main building of the Polytechnikum as well. The Sternwarte focused on the observation of sunspots and was the place where the observations to calculate the Zurich Sunspot Number was coordinated. The Zurich number, invented by the first director of the Sternwarte, Rudolf Wolf, is a way to measure the amount of sunspots and to estimate the activity of the sun. With the number it was actually possible to use data that was gathered since 1610 and calculate the historic sun activity.\n   After the Cantonal Hospital was built close to the Sternwarte in 1945 observing the night sky became limited. The observation was stopped in 1980. Today the former observatory houses the Collegium Helveticum of the Eidgenössisch Technische Hochschule. The Collegium is an interdisiplinary research institute.

Among other things, they are planning a grenade with a weight of 10,000 kg and a wall thickness of 60 cm made of aluminum. They also agreed on a gun barrel 270 m long, 2.70 m inside diameter and a wall thickness of 1.80 m made of cast iron. This requires a suitable weapons industry and capable men to design and build the device. Florida seems like the perfect launch location. Due to the transport of materials, the region needs its own railway line."

Its chairman [SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_club_president').GetLastName] and the secretary, the engineer [SCOPE.sCharacter('gaudi_engineer_scope').GetFullName], feel underutilized after the end of the civil war. They call a meeting to open up a new field of activity. After proposals to start a new war in order to be able to use new weapons, they agree on the proposal to use a cannon to send a projectile from the earth to the moon. Among other things, they are planning a grenade with a weight of 10,000 kg and a wall thickness of 60 cm made of aluminum. They also agreed on a gun barrel 270 m long, 2.70 m inside diameter and a wall thickness of 1.80 m made of cast iron. Guncotton should be used as propellant."

 verrier.132.f: "In fact, one would think that a suicide mission that would launch a human into space in a gigantic cannon projectile would be hard-pressed to find volunteers. But for some members of the Baltimore Gun Club, it's a great honor. Both the president and the chief engineer are entitled to a seat, others advocate a renowned astronomer. More cautious minds argue that only two dogs should be launched into space as a test so as not to endanger human lives."

 verrier.133.f: "The renowned astronomer has calculated that if the cannon were to be built on the current scale and the projectile was aimed in the current way, the capsule would hardly leave Earth's gravity.

Every quarter of an hour the railway brought fresh accessions of sightseers; and, according to the statement of the Tampa Town Observer, not less than five millions of spectators thronged the soil of Florida. The moon advanced upward in a heaven of the purest clearness, outshining in her passage the twinkling light of the stars. It passed over the constellation of the Twins, and was now nearing the halfway point between the horizon and the zenith. A terrible silence weighed upon the entire scene! Not a breath of wind upon the earth! Not a sound of breathing from the countless chests of the spectators! Their hearts seemed afraid to beat! All eyes were fixed upon the yawning mouth of the Columbiad.\n'Thirty-five!-- thirty-six!-- thirty-seven!-- thirty-eight!-- thirty-nine!-- forty!'"

This immense canopy of fire was perceived at a distance of one hundred miles out at sea, and more than one ship's captain entered in his log the appearance of this gigantic meteor. The discharge of the Columbiad was accompanied by a perfect earthquake. Florida was shaken to its very depths. The gases of the powder, expanded by heat, forced back the atmospheric strata with tremendous violence, and this artificial hurricane rushed like a water-spout through the air.\nBut then the experiment got out of control: apparently the cannon was unable to generate enough thrust to propel the projectile into space. After all the fantastic effects, the capsule lost speed, rushed back to earth - and crashed with a loud bang."
