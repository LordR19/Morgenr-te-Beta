 vikelas.100.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('vikelas_ioc_president_scope').GetFullName] desires to revive the ancient Olympic Games in a modern guise. An international sports competition should be held every four years."
 vikelas.100.f: "Inspired by the ancient ideal that a good mind also needs a good body, the Olympic idea developed more and more. Archaeology also contributed to this: at the end of the 19th century, Ernst Curtius excavated Olympia, sparking renewed interest in the Olympic Games. Added to this was the social idea of 'survival of the fittest', nurtured by the evolution theory, and the belief that physical exercise was essential in the age of factory work. As an international event, the modern Olympic Games should overcome national egoism and contribute to peace. The progress that overcomes boundaries in society should be symbolized by striving for sporting records according to the motto 'Citius, altius, fortius' (Faster, Higher, Stronger)."
 vikelas.100.g: "Found the International Olympic Committee."

 vikelas.102.d: "To revitalize the Olympic Games, [SCOPE.sCharacter('vikelas_ioc_president_scope').GetFullName] has set up an International Olympic Committee (IOC), which will be responsible for maintaining and organizing a modern form of the ancient Games."
 vikelas.102.f: "The first IOC consisted primarily of [SCOPE.sCharacter('vikelas_ioc_president_scope').GetFullName]'s confidants. They spread out into a small circle. Later, other IOC members would join and the group of like-minded people would become an international organization."
 vikelas.102.g: "A step forward for national and international sport."
 vikelas.103.t: "The Olympic Games: a Greek affair?"
 vikelas.103.d: "After the founding of the International Olympic Committee, the question arises as to whether the Games will always take place in Greece or whether they will have a different venue every four years."
 vikelas.103.f: "The international representatives had actually wanted the Olympic Games to take place internationally as an international event. Accordingly, the venue should rotate every four years. The decision about the venue should be made by the board. But since Greece has revived the games, this position is not without controversy. Finally, [SCOPE.sCharacter('vikelas_ioc_president_scope').GetFullName] boiled down the question of the venue to a simple formula: 'Our games, our rules'. This would lead to the board being a purely matter of honor and its rights would be severely restricted."

Later, other IOC members would join and the group of like-minded people would become an international organization.

 vikelas.105.t: "The Revival of the Olympics"
 vikelas.105.d: "After the International Olympic Committee (IOC) met, the board decided that the first modern Games should take place in Greece."

Following the ancient example, the committee unanimously decided that the games should take place in Greece in memory of the original Olympic Games. After that, a different country will host the Olympic Games every four years. The venue is selected by the board, which is reconstituted every four years."

 vikelas.109.f: "Since Greece founded the IOC, it was clear that in the future, as in the past, the Games would only take place on Hellenic soil.
