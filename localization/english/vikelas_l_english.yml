 vikelas.100.f: "Inspired by the ancient ideal that a good mind also needs a good body, the Olympic idea developed more and more. Archaeology also contributed to this: at the end of the 19th century, Ernst Curtius excavated Olympia, sparking renewed interest in the Olympic Games. Added to this was the social idea of 'survival of the fittest', nurtured by the evolution theory, and the belief that physical exercise was essential in the age of factory work. As an international event, the modern Olympic Games should overcome national egoism and contribute to peace. The progress that overcomes boundaries in society should be symbolized by striving for sporting records according to the motto 'Citius, altius, fortius' (Faster, Higher, Stronger)."

 vikelas.103.f: "The international representatives had actually wanted the Olympic Games to take place internationally as an international event. Accordingly, the venue should rotate every four years. The decision about the venue should be made by the board. But since Greece has revived the games, this position is not without controversy.

In addition, epee fencing is one of five disciplines of the modern pentathlon, which was redesigned as an Olympic competition and first held during the 1912 Summer Games in Stockholm."
 vikelas.131.f_shooting: "The IOC assigned nine shooting events to the Olympic program of the Second Olympiad.

Of the more than 6,000 participating shooters, only 72 athletes took part in the Olympic competitions. Prize shooting was a widespread and lucrative affair at the time, but accepting money for a sporting achievement was not in keeping with the Olympic spirit, which is why professionals were not allowed to take part in Olympic competitions.

 vikelas.132.f_rowing: "At the 2nd Olympic Games in Paris, the organization of boat rowing was so poor that the committee had to organize two finals. The inclusion of both finals in the IOC's winners' list is a sign of the difficult coming to terms with the circumstances under which the 1900 Summer Olympics took place."
 vikelas.132.f_sailing: "Olympic sailing has been part of the Games program since 1900: At the second modern Olympic Games in Paris, teams sailed for medals for the first time. Sailing was supposed to have its Olympic premiere in Athens in 1896, but the competitions could not take place due to bad weather conditions. Apart from the 1904 Summer Olympics, sailing has been present in every edition of the Olympic Games. Most of the Olympic sailing competitions were done in what is called a fleet race format. At some Olympics, however, was also the match race format, or a mixed fleet/match race format."
 vikelas.132.f_swimming: "At the 1896 Summer Olympics, four swimming events were contested, all for men. They were planned and organized by the Sub-Committee for Nautical Sports. All events took place on 11 April in the Bay of Zea. The Bay of Zea is a seaport and marina in the Athens area; it was used as the swimming venue because the organizers of the Games wanted to avoid spending money on constructing a special purpose swimming venue.

At the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis, boxing celebrated its premiere as a modern Olympic sport. However, only Americans took part here, a total of 44 in seven weight classes. There was no Olympic boxing tournament in 1912 because boxing was banned in Sweden at the time."
 vikelas.133.f_wrestling: "At the 1896 Summer Olympics, one wrestling event was contested. It was organized and prepared by the Sub-Committee for Wrestling and Gymnastics. Five competitors from four nations competed.The winner was the German Carl Schumann. Wrestling first took place in the Greco-Roman style, and freestyle was introduced in 1904. Wrestling was important at the games, not least because the ancient Olympic Games already featured this discipline."
 vikelas.133.f_archery: "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) assigned six archery competitions to the Olympic program of the Second Olympiad because, according to Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, and according to the IOC, international participation is a basic requirement for archery an Olympic competition. Archery was a popular sport at the time and was therefore opened with a large parade in which 1,723 archers took part. 5254 shooters took part in the entire competition.

 vikelas.301.t: "Football Club founded"
 vikelas.301.d: "Workers and labourers in [SCOPE.sState('vikelas_football_club_state_scope').GetName] have been meeting for football games for weeks. Now they have founded a club: [SCOPE.sState('vikelas_football_club_state_scope').GetCustom('vikelas_historical_football_club_names_type')]."
 vikelas.301.f: "In 1848, students at Cambridge University wrote the first football rules. Afterwards a team consisted of 15 to 20 players. In 1857, cricketers founded Sheffield FC, the world's first official football club. England is now considered the 'motherland of football', also because the first football association was founded here with the Football Association (FA), founded in London in 1863, a comprehensive set of rules was created and the development of the sport was sustainably promoted. In continental Europe, football was first able to establish itself in Switzerland. Football was introduced to the Lake Geneva region around 1855 by English people studying at private schools there."
 vikelas.301.g: "A sport worth supporting."
 vikelas.301.h: "What a boring game."
 vikelas.302.t: "Rival Football Club founded"
 vikelas.302.d: "After a disagreement with a football club in the neighboring state, the workers in [SCOPE.sState('vikelas_football_club_state_scope').GetName] came together and founded their own club, which they called [SCOPE.sState('vikelas_football_club_state_scope').GetCustom('vikelas_historical_football_club_names_type')]. Apparently there is animosity between the two clubs."
 vikelas.302.f: "A fair number of sports clubs have their origins in splits and disagreements with other clubs. Inter Milan, for example, was founded by several disgruntled cosmopolitan members of the Milan Cricket and Football Club (now AC Milan) in the Milanese restaurant Ristorante Orologio. The 'Football Club Internazionale Milano', as the club was officially called, was split off from the nationalist Milan CFC, in which only Italians were allowed to play."
 vikelas.302.g: "Is this a brewing rivalry?"
 vikelas.303.t: "Football Association founded"
 vikelas.303.d: "The various clubs in our country have now formed a national football association that aims to host a football league."
 vikelas.303.f: "The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by the footballer and cricketer Charles W. Alcock, and has been contested by English teams since 1872. England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor."
 vikelas.303.g: "This is supposed to keep the people busy."

 vikelas.311.t: "Baseball Club founded"
 vikelas.311.d: ""
 vikelas.311.f: "The first documented baseball club in the USA was the New York Knickerbockers in 1845. They also created the first written rules, which were largely co-authored by Alexander Cartwright. However, these do not include all the rules of the game according to which the game was played back then, but only provide binding decisions for a number of common cases of doubt. Baseball was initially concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, but soon expanded to the West Coast; For the most part, interest in the Southern States and the Rocky Mountains has only emerged in the last few decades. In New York, the National League was founded in 1876 by teams from Cincinnati, Chicago, Boston, St. Louis, Hartford, Louisville, New York and Philadelphia."
 vikelas.311.h: "What an overrated game."
 vikelas.313.t: "National Baseball League"
 vikelas.313.d: "The various clubs in our country have now formed a national baseball association that aims to host a baseball league."
 vikelas.313.f: "In the 1860s, the sport of baseball, previously popular primarily in New York, became a national phenomenon in the United States. The decisive factor for this was soldiers who played the game in military camps during the American Civil War and thus ensured that the sport became more widespread. In 1857, the first American baseball association, the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP), was founded. By 1867, more than 400 clubs had joined the association. However, the strongest teams were still located in the northeastern United States, particularly in New York. Founded in 1871, NABBP's successor organization, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP) - also known as the National Association (NA) - is considered the first professional baseball league in the world."
 vikelas.313.g: "This is supposed to keep the people busy."
 vikelas.314.t: "Baseball"
 vikelas.314.d: "The people of our country have come into contact with an American sport that is gaining more and more fans. [GetPlayer.GetNameNoFlag] is in a baseball frenzy."
 vikelas.314.f: "Although perceived as a US national sport, baseball also spread to two other, fundamentally different countries, where it would soon assume a similar position. The game was brought to Japan by Horace Wilson in 1872, shortly after the country opened. At a time when Japan was open to Western innovations, the game quickly became popular. However, it would take over 30 years for the sport to become more professional. Baseball was also popularized in Cuba by Nemesio Guillot, who founded the first major baseball club in the country. It became the most played sport in the country in the 1870s, before the period of American intervention. Despite its American origin, baseball is strongly associated with Cuban nationalism, as it effectively replaced colonial Spanish sports such as bullfighting."
 vikelas.314.g: "Give me my bat!"

 vikelas.321.t: "Cricket Club founded"
 vikelas.321.d: "Some influential people have founded a sports club to pursue their favorite pastime: the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetState.GetStateRegion.GetCityHubName] Cricket Club."
 vikelas.321.f: "In the 18th century, cricket became the national sport in England. Nobles and rich merchants began to form their own teams. Over the course of the 19th century, the sport became a connecting element between Great Britain and its colonies. The growth of cricket in the mid and late 19th century was assisted by the development of the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Cricket had a broad impact on British culture and influenced the lexicon the English language."
 vikelas.321.h: "What a pretentious game."

 vikelas.402.t: "World Cup in [SCOPE.sCountry('vikelas_fifa_host_scope').GetName]"
 vikelas.402.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('vikelas_fifa_host_scope').GetName] has announced that it will host a football World Cup. Hoping to show the world its skill, our country sent a national team to bring home the trophy."
 vikelas.402.f: "The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men's national football teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as the host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament. In the final between the two big favorites, the home team from Uruguay won the first World Cup title in history against Argentina."
 vikelas.402.g: "May the better one win!"
 vikelas.403.t: "World Cup ends"
 vikelas.403.d_quarter: "Unfortunately, our national team only reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup. The new world champion is [SCOPE.sCountry('vikelas_fifa_champion_scope').GetName]."
 vikelas.403.d_semi: "Our national team put up a brave fight, but in the end it was only enough for the semi-finals. The new world champion is [SCOPE.sCountry('vikelas_fifa_champion_scope').GetName]."
 vikelas.403.d_final: "Our national team showed an excellent performance and made it to the final. Unfortunately it lost to the new world champions [SCOPE.sCountry('vikelas_fifa_champion_scope').GetName]. At least we were able to secure second place in the World Cup."
 vikelas.403.d_champion: "Our national team won the World Cup! This is a day of joy for the entire country, the population is in a state of joy."
 vikelas.403.f: "'Football is a simple game; 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win.'"
 vikelas.403.g: "This sport has never been important."
 vikelas.403.h: "We are the champions."
