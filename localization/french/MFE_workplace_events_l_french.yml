 MFE_workplace_events.1.t: "Mine Accident" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.1.d: "A horrible accident has occurred at the mine in [SCOPE.sState('mine_state').GetName]. Two people have died after an explosion at the [SCOPE.sState('mine_state').GetName] mine. Minor accidents like this happen all the time but this one was...different. All the local workers refuse to continue their duties until conditions have improved." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.1.f: "I saw it with my own two eyes, the both of them were blown to bits and crushed in the most painful way a man could imagine. We won't work another day in these mines, it just isn't safe." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.1.a: "That really is a shame, get them back to work..immediately" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.1.b: "The people working the mines are humans like the rest of us!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.1.c: "We should have never started mining to begin with" #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.2.t: "The Girl From The Coal Pits" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.2.d: "The coal laden tub must have weighed heavily on her body, fragile and worn from many years of arduous labour in the coal pits, for her feet could no longer carry her. There, in the dark, where the shafts go countless fathoms deep, she slipped and fell.'\n\nAnother young girl has lost her life in a coal mining accident in one of our provinces, and the particular tragedy of the case has received national attention." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.2.f: "How can they just let us go on like this, it's like we're not even human." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.2.a: "She was just a girl...what have we become" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.2.tt: "The people of [SCOPE.sState('mining_state').GetName] are plotting something sinister..." #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.3.t: "Production Shortfalls" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.3.d: "One of our munitions factories has experienced a severe shortfall in production over the past three months, which has gone unreported for fear of causing alarm among investors and local industrial magnates. By covering the factory's losses with materials from the national stockpile, we could be perceived as saving local jobs." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.3.f: "They tell us to shoot people but don't give us nothing to shoot them with, how can an army fight this way?!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.3.a: "Nothing can be done" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.3.b: "Send them some cash, that might do the trick" #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.4.t: "Tea Factory Robbed" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.4.d: "The central tea weighing station in one of our tea producing provinces has been held up by armed thugs. Some locals speculate that harsh times in the province might have provoked local farmers, tired of seeing local distributors and retailers eating away at their profits, to rob the station. Whatever the cause may be, we need to address the situation." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.4.f: "They came in the black of night, killed the guards, and then robbed the entire place of all the green tea we had. They left all the black tea behind though but no one want to drink that anyway." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.4.a: "What do we need tea for anyway" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.4.b: "I would conquer the entire world for a cup of tea! They must be found." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.4.ttt: "Launch an investigation into the robbery." #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.5.t: "Old Canned Food" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.5.d: "The Quartermaster General reports the discovery of a forgotten cache of canned foodstuffs in an army stockpile in [SCOPE.sState('canning_state').GetName]. The content of the cans is still, despite being several years old, apparently quite edible. What should we do with the 15 tonnes of canned food?" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.5.f: "We found it in a back corner with a pile of dust on it a meter thick. We tested if it was edible by giving it to a rat and it did eat it. As the saying goes 'if a rat will eat it the workers will too'." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.5.a: "That is disgusting" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.5.b: "Im sure we can find some people to eat that goop!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.5.tt: "Pop wealth in [SCOPE.sState('canning_state').GetName] will be reduced." #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.6.t: "Bovine Fever" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.6.d: "A strange fever has erupted among the livestock in [SCOPE.sState('bovine_state').GetName], and the livestock are reported dying en masse. The veterinarian at the local garrison has been criss-crossing the province trying to what little can be done to stave off the effects of this, apparently quite contagious, disease. While the disease itself will eventually dissipate, the question of reimbursement for hundreds of ruined farmers and their families still requires attention." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.6.f: "I went out to the fields yestermorn and, lo and behold, I looked upon my cattle and they were filled with green pores and oozing strange purple puss. These cows used to be worth so much now we can only hope to sell them to the [GetPopType('peasants').GetName] and they won't notice the fowl odor they emit." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.6.a: "Send all the help they need!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.6.b: "We can't spare anything to help" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.6.c: "Talk with neighboring states and see if we can get them help" #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.7.t: "Death In The Silk Fields" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.7.d: "The cocoons shrivel and die, and what little thread there is on them fails to coagulate properly, and unravels at the slightest breeze. Something is awry in the silk fields, and even our best chemists have not been able to find a cure for the disease that plagues our farms. Local silk farmers are outraged, and call upon the government to act." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.7.f: "It's like nothing we have ever seen before, all our hard work going to nothing. It all just dies all the workers are hopeless, no silk means no job and no job means no way to live they say." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.7.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_silk_field_owner').GetFullName] is only doing [SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_silk_field_owner').GetHerHis] job" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.7.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_silk_field_owner').GetFullName] will pay for [SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_silk_field_owner').GetHerHis] ignorance" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.7.tt: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_silk_field_owner').GetFullName] will be arrested and removed from [SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_silk_field_owner').GetHerHis] position of power." #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.8.t: "Blood and Iron" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.8.d: "Not by speeches and votes of the majority, are the great questions of the time decided, but by iron and blood.'\n-Otto von Bismarck\n\nA new, rich lode of minerals has been discovered in the [SCOPE.sState('iron_state').GetName] iron mines. While the vein is rich, it is also located on a perilous depth that is just beyond the reach of our present mining technology. They attempted to extract the ore, but doing so cost us in lives and blood. Several workers lay deceased in the huge pit of iron but now the iron can be mined at rates that were thought to be impossible before." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.8.f: "We've never seen anything like it, a vein of iron so large it would quadruple production. So we sent a few fellows down there to check it out and build a way to mine it out. They got there but it wasn't pretty out of the 10 men that left only 1 came back and he was barely alive to tell the tale." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.8.a: "Give them a few days off and send some aid" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.8.b: "Who cares about a few deaths...get back to work!" #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.9.t: "Tragedy At The Mine" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.9.d: "Another tragic day for our labourers today, as an accident was reported as having claimed several lives in the iron mines of [SCOPE.sState('iron_tragedy_state')]. Several workers have been reported injured, and some are still missing. A faulty support beam in the mine collapsed to cause the accident, reports say. The incident is bound to raise at least a local debate on working conditions in our mines." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.9.f: "How could this happen..." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.9.a: "Those damn industrialists..." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.9.b: "Support the workers in any way we can" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.9.c: "Why can't we go back to simpler times in the fields" #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.10.t: "Cotton Quality Problems" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.10.d: "The cotton plantations of [SCOPE.sState('cotton_state').GetName] have been having numerous issues with the quality of the cotton they produce. Some say it is due to weird things in the rain but it could be anything..." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.10.f: "I can't use this junk, how can you even call that cotton?!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.10.a: "The landowners will get us out of this one" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.10.b: "The rural folk have been doing this for centuries" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.10.c: "Religious leaders will pray for better cotton" #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.11.t: "Boiler Explosion" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.11.d: "Tragedy struck [SCOPE.sState('steamer_state').GetName] today, when a steam boiler exploded during a routine test in the machine shop contracted to build it for the local steamer factory. Seven workers were killed in the explosion, and several thousands of pounds worth of equipment were destroyed. Local officials are investigating the working conditions in the shop, and hopefully these accidents can be avoided in the future, but, for now, [SCOPE.sState('steamer_state').GetName] mourns her dead." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.11.f: "This is just awful, we checked those boilers last week no one could have imagined they would have exploded." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.11.a: "These events are simply the price of progress." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.11.b: "Workers should not be exploited and forced into such conditions." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.11.c: "Machines are dangerous! Industry itself is a cancer." #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.12.t: "Destruction at the Dyeworks" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.12.d: "Several workers died today at the one of our dyeworks, when an industrial sized tub of hot dye accidentally spilled out over the workshop floor and the unsuspecting workers. Locals are upset about the incident, claiming that the poor safety regulations in the hot and dangerous workplace are to blame for the accident, and are urging the government to take action. As rescue workers left the scene, several workshop employees were left dying." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.12.f: "I was just working, dying some shirts and then everyone just started up and dying around me." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.12.a: "Everyone has to dye someday" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.12.b: "They shall not have dyed in vain!" #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.13.t: "Oil Cistern Explodes" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.13.d: "A fuel cistern at one of our refineries in [SCOPE.sState('oil_state').GetName] exploded today for reasons yet unknown, and the lives of seven workers were claimed in the ensuing conflagration, along with thousands of dollars’ worth in company property. The refinery owner has washed his hands of any responsibility for the accident, claiming instead that government safety inspections have been lacking." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.13.f: "This is just awful the oil was flowing great the other day then it just goes and explodes, what a shame." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.13.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_oil_owner').GetFullName] is only doing [SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_oil_owner').GetHerHis] job" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.13.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_oil_owner').GetFullName] will not continue this [SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_oil_owner').GetHerHis] ignorance" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.13.tt: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('guilty_oil_owner').GetFullName] will be arrested and will disappear..." #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.14.t: "Overproduction at the Refinery" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.14.d: "One of our refineries has been doing well lately, with production exceeding expected quotas by several thousand gallons. Due to storage problems, the refinery owner has approached the government with a deal to buy the fuel at a steep discount. We could either buy the fuel ourselves, or turn him down and wait for him to float the cheap fuel on the market. The local impact of cheap fuel should make the locals fairly happy, but we could probably use the fuel ourselves." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.14.f: "The black gold is a flowin!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.14.a: "Oil is the fuel of the future!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.14.b: "Direct the funds to more...legitimate matters" #NT!

 MFE_workplace_events.15.d: "A fisherman off the [SCOPE.sState('fishing_state').GetName] coast by the name of [SCOPE.sCharacter('fisherman').GetName] has brought in an enormous catch today. His trawler is practically teeming with the riches of the richest of oceans as he anchors in the harbor, and fairly soon other fishermen are able to repeat his example. The fishing is unusually good in [SCOPE.sState('fishing_state').GetName] this year, it seems." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.15.f: "I saw [SCOPE.sCharacter('fisherman').GetName] off the coast only a few days ago. He was realing them in like he was possessed, I saw about 500 fish go up into his boat within an hour. He had to head back to [SCOPE.sState('fishing_state').GetName] only because his boat was about to sink from the sheer weight of the fish he'd caught. When he came ashore most of the fish he caught could have fed a family of 9 for a month they were so large." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.15.a: "How could we interfere, that is just amazing" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.15.b: "The people of [SCOPE.sState('fishing_state').GetName] will have the cheapest fish in the world" #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.16.t: "Explosives Explode" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.16.d: "A fire at a [SCOPE.sBuilding('explosion_building').GetName] Explosives Warehouse has caused a massive blast that some say could be heard all the way to [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. The devastation is massive, and hundreds of lives in the vicinity are reported lost. As the fire spreads through the city, the fire department needs to prioritize: The fire threatens to spread north to the affluent [SCOPE.sBuilding('explosion_building').GetName] neighbourhoods, and south to poorer areas." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.16.f: "Several of the workers in the [SCOPE.sBuilding('explosion_building').GetName] warned that the explosives would explode, but no one belived them..not until it was too late." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.16.a: "Repair the Factory immediately!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.16.b: "There is nothing but rubble, what can be done..." #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.17.t: "Elegant furniture" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.17.d: "Mayhaps this chair, madame? Made from the finest Brazilian Mahogany, inlaid with delicate Nubian patterns of Kenyan ivory. Observe the rich marbling on the leather. You won't find another one like it in all of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName]!'\n\nRising standards of living in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] have caused an upswing in the demand for better and more elegant furniture. As people's homes are beautified, it only makes sense that the offices of government are, likewise, upgraded to better conform to modern standards." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.17.f: "Furniture this beautiful was thought to be impossible it is simply amazing!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.17.a: "Encourage production!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.17.b: "The rich will love those tables!" #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.18.t: "Factory stinks" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.18.d: "Locals in one of our provinces, [SCOPE.sState('stinking_state').GetName], are complaining about certain emissions coming from the local fertilizer factory. While the place might smell like roses to the provincial budget, the balance certainly hasn't been adding up for local noses lately. We could support an ordinance to modify the work process, but doing so might anger local captains of industry." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.18.f: "I awoke this morning and took to the streets and was greeted with the most putrid smell I have ever experienced. It did not seem possible that such a disgusting stench could actually exists, but one thing was clear. It was coming from the chemical plant." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.18.a: "Crops do not grow themselves, sadly." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.18.b: "We should consider some local restrictions." #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.19.t: "Clipper Boom" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.19.d: "The wharfs, quays, and drydocks in one of our coastal provinces are abuzz with the rings of hammers and the songs of saws, as the local factory struggles to keep up with new orders for clipper ships that are pouring in from all over the world. Efficient work processes and management, combined with excellent craftsmanship and seamanship, have led them to produce more and better ships than during any year previous! Perhaps this is the time to rest on the laurels, but, then again, the future is always an uncertainty." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.19.f: "These ships are the finest in the world, just look at them the sails glisten in the sun with a beauty that seems impossible." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.19.a: "Let us celebrate!" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.19.b: "Establish a Naval School" #NT!
  
 MFE_workplace_events.20.t: "Radio [SCOPE.sState('radio_state').GetName]" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.20.d: "A local radio station in one of our provinces, [SCOPE.sState('radio_state').GetName], is facing a shortage of radio components for their transmitters, and have been forced to cease broadcasts until the situation is resolved. Local authorities have suggested lending some of the government's radio components to the station, as it fears that the local populace will be alarmed by a lack of news from the front." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.20.f: "Did you hear, the radio station in [SCOPE.sState('radio_state').GetName] went out the other day. Who knows what could be happening with the war now..." #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.20.a: "We have none to spare" #NT!
 MFE_workplace_events.20.b: "Give them the radios" #NT!
