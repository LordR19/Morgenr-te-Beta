 elgar_classicism_tech: "Classicism"
 elgar_classicism_tech_desc: "Classicism, in the arts, refers generally to a high regard for a classical period, classical antiquity in the Western tradition, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate. In its purest form, classicism is an aesthetic attitude dependent on principles based in the culture, art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome, with the emphasis on form, simplicity, proportion, clarity of structure, perfection, restrained emotion, as well as explicit appeal to the intellect."
 elgar_irrationalism_tech: "Irrationalism"
 elgar_irrationalism_tech_desc: "Irrationalism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the early 19th century, emphasizing the non-rational dimension of human life. Irrationalists declare that human reason alone is incapable of recognizing the foundations, connections and laws of objective reality. As alternatives for descriptive and normative explanations of the world, higher cognitive functions such as, for example, intuition, faith, intuition or direct experience are suggested."

 elgar_art_nouveau_tech: "Art Nouveau"
 elgar_art_nouveau_tech_desc: "#R This technology is only available via Journal Entry!#!\n\nArt Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts. The style is known by different names in different languages: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English. It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk ("total work of art") that would unify the arts."
 elgar_art_deco_tech: "Art Déco"
 elgar_art_deco_tech_desc: "Art Déco combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, it represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. Art Deco is one of the first truly international styles, but its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II."
 elgar_impressionism_tech: "Impressionism"
 elgar_impressionism_tech_desc: "#R This technology is only available via Journal Entry!#!\n\nImpressionism is a style of art from the 19th century that is characterized by the atmospheric depiction of fleeting snapshots. The term impressionism has also been applied to certain styles of music, literature, film and photography."
 elgar_neoclassicism_tech: "Neoclassicism"
 elgar_neoclassicism_tech_desc: "After the turn of the century there was a renewed enthusiasm for classical ideals: Neoclassicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. While architects were once again using Roman and Greek construction as models, composers were rediscovering Baroque music as a source of inspiration."
 elgar_expressionism_tech: "Expressionism"
 elgar_expressionism_tech_desc: "#R This technology is only available via Journal Entry!#!\n\nExpressionism is a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas."
 elgar_new_objectivity_tech: "New Objectivity"
 elgar_new_objectivity_tech_desc: "Although principally describing a tendency in German painting, the term took a life of its own and came to characterize the attitude of public life in Weimar Germany as well as the art, literature, music, and architecture created to adapt to it. Rather than some goal of philosophical objectivity, it was meant to imply a turn towards practical engagement with the world - an all-business attitude, understood by Germans as intrinsically American."

The ADMV aimed at both musical performance and practical support. As part of the artistic aims of the ADMV, annual Tonkünstler-Versammlungen at different locations were to be arranged, with performances of important, rarely heard, and especially new musical works of all kinds. However, older works that were only seldom or not at all heard, but of interest because of their importance, were also to be performed."

 elgar.9.f: "The twelve-tone technique - also known as dodecaphony, twelve-tone serialism, and (in British usage) twelve-note composition - is a method of musical composition. The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note  through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. All 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Over time, the technique increased greatly in popularity and eventually became widely influential on 20th-century composers. It is commonly considered a form of serialism."

Construction of the Amazon Theatre was first proposed in 1881 by a member of the local House of Representatives, Antonio Jose Fernandes Júnior, who envisioned a 'jewel' in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. The theatre's architectural style is considered typically Renaissance Revival. The roofing tiles were imported from Alsace, the steel walls from Glasgow, Scotland and the Carrara marble for the stairs, statues and columns, from Italy. The dome is covered with 36,000 decorated ceramic tiles painted in the colors of the national flag of Brazil. The interior furnishing came from France in the Louis Quinze style. Italian artist Domenico de Angelis the Younger painted the panels that decorate the ceilings of the auditorium and of the audience chamber."

If I were a prince, I would build him a temple in the Palladian style!

 elgar.104.d: "Due to the high number of visitors, Franz Liszt proposed diverting men and material from the Cologne Cathedral construction site to Bonn in order to build a festival hall in record time."
 elgar.104.f: "The official unveiling of the Beethoven Monument was to be the high point of a 3-day Beethoven Festival. A month before the festival was due to commence, there was not a suitable venue to hold the expected 3,000 attendees. At Liszt's urgings, and only after he offered to bear the full cost himself, the committee engaged an architect and builders to construct the Beethoven Hall. By the time they finally started, they had less than two weeks to do this, and had to work around the clock to finish it on time. Franz Liszt also spoke to the builders of Cologne Cathedral. Lumber was loaded from Cologne to Bonn via the Rhine. Decorations made in Cologne also came to Bonn so quickly. In just eleven days, a festival hall was created out of nowhere."

 elgar.105.f: "The ceremony was not without its awkward moments. The Beethoven monument turned its back on the most important guests, King Frederick William IV of Prussia and the British Queen Victoria, who had taken their places on the balcony of the Fürstenberg Palace. Alexander von Humboldt saved the day by remarking that Beethoven had always been a rude fellow. Even more embarrassing was the fact that, during the toasts at the festival banquet in the 'Goldene Stern', Liszt snubbed the French contingent led by Berlioz and nearly caused a riot. The banquet was disrupted by the behaviour of Lola Montez, who danced on a table and embarrassed Liszt by insisting she was his guest at the celebrations and demanding a seat appropriate to her claimed status, thus upsetting a pre-organised seating arrangement."

 elgar.106.f: "'Be that as it may, his cantata, truly well performed and warmly applauded by three quarters and a half of the hall, is a great and beautiful thing, which at once elevates Liszt very highly among composers. The expression in it is true, the intonation right, the style sublime and new, the form well conceived and dutifully executed, the instrumentation remarkable for its vigor and variety. There is never a succession of the same sounds in his orchestra, which makes certain works, once prized, so tiresome for the listener; he knows how to use the small and large means, he demands neither the instruments nor the voices too much; in a word, he showed in one fell swoop that he had style in instrumentation and in the other parts of the musical art, since one feared he hadn't found it yet.' - Hector Berlioz"

 elgar.107.d: "The celebrations surrounding the unveiling of the Beethoven Monument have given composer Hector Belrioz considerable inspiration."
 elgar.107.f: "'It was during this trip to Austria, Hungary, Bohemia and Silesia that I started composing my legend of Faust, the plan of which I had been pondering for a long time. As soon as I resolved to undertake it, I had to settle for writing myself most of the libretto as well; the fragments of the French translation of Goethe’s Faust by Gérard de Nerval, which I had already set to music twenty years before, and which I intended to include in the new score in a revised version, and two or three other scenes which had been written before my departure from Paris by M. Gandonnière following my instructions, did not add up to one-sixth of the entire work. During the journey in the old German stage-coach, I therefore tried to write the verses intended for my music. I started with Faust’s invocation to nature, without attempting to translate or even imitate Goethe’s masterpiece, but only to draw inspiration from it and to extract the musical substance that it contained. Once I had started I wrote the remaining verses as the musical ideas came to me, and I composed the score with an ease that I have rarely experienced with my other works.' - Hector Berlioz"

The Majesties then proceeded through the main entrance of the central nave to the choir, in which a celebratory cantata was being performed by the Cologne men's choral society with the organ accompaniment of the music director Weber."

Significant sponsors abroad but also in Vienna finally supported the construction of the monument. The Bavarian King Ludwig I of Bavaria donated a considerable sum and donated the base of the bronze statue."

 elgar.113.f: "Designed by Ludwig Schwanthaler and cast by Johann Baptist Stiglmaier, the monument was ceremonially unveiled on September 5, 1842 in the presence of both of Mozart's surviving sons, Franz Xaver and Carl Thomas. However, Mozart's widow was not able to see the inauguration. She had died shortly before in the house at Mozartplatz 8. A festival with a torchlight procession, boat trips, Alpine trains, target shooting and horse races framed the celebration."

 elgar.114.f: "Originally, the Frankfurt citizenship wanted to organize a concert to collect enough donations for a Mozart monument. Monuments to bourgeois personalities were a novelty in Germany. The erection of monuments in honor of national figures such as artists or scientists was therefore a welcome opportunity to express patriotic feelings. Some in Frankfurt even suggest organizing a national singers' meeting, the proceeds of which should flow into a foundation for German musicians to promote young musicians."

The event turned into a demonstration for the political unification of Germany, however. The money raised was raised for a foundation to support young composers."
 elgar.116.f: "'The city went into raptures. The houses were filled with people up to the skylights. The people of Mainz, Hanau, and Offenbach came by boat to the sound of cannon shots, surrounded by decorated boats with music; through all the gates they entered. It was a powerfully moving sight, the artistic interest became secondary, but the national approached us powerfully; I won't deny that bright tears ran down my cheeks.' - Heinrich Hoffmann"

A discussion immediately arose about whether we belong to the New German School or whether we defend the conservative idea of music."
 elgar.121.f: "The New German School is a term introduced in 1859 by Franz Brendel, editor of the Neue Zeitung für Musik, to describe certain trends in German music. It has been used by different persons at different times with different meanings. It is generally agreed that Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner were among the most prominent representatives of the 'New German School'. There is also a consensus that Johannes Brahms did not take part. Beyond this, interpretations differ. The new term should be understood as denoting the whole period since Beethoven's death. According to Brendel, it was common usage to call the period of J.S. Bach and Handel 'Old German School'. The subsequent period was that of Viennese masters such as Mozart who had been influenced by the Italian style. Beethoven had redirected interest to the German North again and with this had opened the 'Neudeutsche Schule'. Composers from both sides looked back on Beethoven as their spiritual and artistic hero; the conservatives seeing him as an unsurpassable peak, the progressives as a new beginning in music."

During the second Tonkunstler meeting (1861) in Weimar, the statutes of the General German Music Association (ADMV) were adopted by over 700 founding members. The New Magazine for Music became the organ of the association. At the end of the 19th century, the ADMV was under the protectorate of the Grand Duke of Weimar. The ADMV has held a number of large Tonkunstler gatherings. It mostly oriented itself to the direction of the New German School represented by Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. As part of the artistic aims of the ADMV, annual Tonkünstler meetings at different locations were to be arranged, with performances of important, rarely heard, and especially new musical works of all kinds. However, older works that were only seldom or not at all heard, but of interest because of their importance, were also to be performed. In addition, new works, either musical or scholarly ones, were to be printed."

 elgar.125.f: "The 'War of the Romantics' is a term used by some music historians to describe the schism among prominent musicians in the second half of the 19th century. Musical structure, the limits of chromatic harmony, and program music versus absolute music were the principal areas of contention. The opposing parties crystallized during the 1850s. The most prominent members of the conservative circle were Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim, Clara Schumann, and the Leipzig Conservatoire, which had been founded by Felix Mendelssohn. Their opponents, the radical progressives mainly from Weimar, were represented by Franz Liszt and the members of the so-called New German School (German: Neudeutsche Schule), and by Richard Wagner. The controversy was German and Central European in origin; musicians from France, Italy, and Russia were only marginally involved. Composers from both sides looked back on Beethoven as their spiritual and artistic hero; the conservatives seeing him as an unsurpassable peak, the progressives as a new beginning in music. "

This was an outgrowth of the debate on the viability of the symphony genre, which had grown in the hands of Ludwig van Beethoven from one intended for entertainment to a form that included social, moral and cultural ideals. Liszt and his circle favored new styles in writing and forms that would blend music with narrative and pictorial ideas. Toward this end Liszt developed the symphonic poem. The Leipzig/Berlin school championed the forms used by the classic masters, forms codified by musicologists such as Adolf Bernhard Marx of the early 19th century. The validity of program music was also a point of contention.

The opera is a Singspiel, containing much spoken dialogue between distinct musical numbers. The opera remains popular in Germany, and the overture is sometimes heard in concert in other countries. Nicolai wrote the opera while he was working as first conductor at the Kärntnertortheater in Vienna, where he was also contracted to compose a German opera. He finally settled on his friend Siegfried Kapper's suggestion that he use Shakespeare's comedy 'The Merry Wives of Windsor' as a basis. Since there was no contract extension in 1847, Nicolai moved to the Royal Opera House in Berlin on March 1, 1848."

 elgar.202.f: "Robert Schumann is regarded as one of the most representative composers of the Romantic era. In 1850, he suceeded Ferdinand Hiller as musical director and moved to Düsseldorf. Although criticized regarding his poor conductor skills and scoffed because of his 'creative decay', Schumann composed his last symphony, the 'Rhenish'. He used Beethoven's and Mendelssohn's symphonies as a model, but was also inspired by his impressions of the Rhineland. Schumann himself stated that his journey to Cologne and the sight of the cathedral were his main inspiration for this composition, which became one of his most famous works."

 elgar.203.f: "Richard Georg Strauss was a leading German composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. He is known for his operas, which include Der Rosenkavalier and Salome, his Lieder - especially his Four Last Songs - and his tone poems and other orchestral works, such as Death and Transfiguration, Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks, Also sprach Zarathustra, An Alpine Symphony, and Metamorphosen. Strauss was also a prominent conductor throughout Germany and Austria. Strauss, along with Gustav Mahler, represents the late flowering of German Romanticism after Richard Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of orchestration are combined with an advanced harmonic style. In 1905, Strauss produced Salome, a somewhat dissonant modernist opera based on the play by Oscar Wilde, in 1909 followed Elektra. Both were performed in Dresden for the first time."

 elgar.204.f: "Giacomo Meyerbeer was one of the most successful opera composers of the 19th century and is considered a master of French grand opéra. The son of a Jewish sugar manufacturer was also trained as a pianist for a time by Muzio Clementi and appeared in public at the age of nine. At the beginning of 1813 he went to Vienna and devoted ten months to musical studies with Antonio Salieri. At the end of 1815, on the advice of Salieri, he moved to Italy, where he wrote a series of operas for the local stage in the new operatic style established by Gioachino Rossini. Meyerbeer spent the following years commuting between Berlin and Paris. His 1824 opera Il crociato in Egitto was the first to bring him Europe-wide reputation, but it was Robert le diable which raised his status to great celebrity. Meyerbeer's grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition."

 elgar.211.f: "The Fifth Symphony, in B flat major, is perhaps the most accomplished of his youthful symphonies and is widely regarded as Schubert's first 'mature' symphony. Its elaboration is of chamber music perfection, for the instrumentation is smaller than that of any other symphony, and its proportions are finely tuned to one another. It can be understood as Schubert's productive examination of Mozart's symphonic works and reveals Schubert's complete otherness and independence. According to Schubert's own entries on the score, the work was composed between September and October 3, 1816; it was written at a time when Schubert was looking for his own musical language. The first performance of Schubert's 5th symphony took place with a small amateur orchestra in Vienna in 1816; the first public performance, on the other hand, only took place on October 17, 1841, thirteen years after Schubert's death, under the baton of Michael Leitermayer."

He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as 'The Waltz King', and was largely then responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century. Some of Johann Strauss's most famous works include The Blue Danube, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known. The operetta Die Fledermaus premiered on 5 April 1874 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, and has been part of the regular operetta repertoire ever since."

 elgar.213.f: "Anton Bruckner was an Austrian composer known for his symphonies, masses, and motets. The first are considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German Romanticism because of their rich harmonic language, strongly polyphonic character, and considerable length. Bruckner's compositions helped to define contemporary musical radicalism, owing to their dissonances, unprepared modulations, and roving harmonies. Unlike other musical radicals, such as Richard Wagner or Hugo Wolf who fit the enfant terrible mould, Bruckner showed extreme humility before other musicians, Wagner in particular. The apparent dichotomy between Bruckner the man and Bruckner the composer hampers efforts to describe his life in a way that gives a straightforward context for his music. His works, the symphonies in particular, had detractors, most notably the influential Austrian critic Eduard Hanslick, and other supporters of Johannes Brahms."

His 24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1 are among the best known of his compositions and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the last rites. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused. A week later, on May 27, 1840, the 57-year-old Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa. This has led to a public discussion about how to deal with Paganini. There are voices in favor of putting pressure on the church and burying Paganini in Genoa, befitting his status, and claiming his legacy. However, this would lead to an open dispute with the ecclesiastical authorities."

The best-known number from the opera is the 'Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves', a chorus that is regularly given an encore in many opera houses when performed today. Nabucco is the opera that is considered to have permanently established Verdi's reputation as a composer. He commented that 'this is the opera with which my artistic career really begins. And though I had many difficulties to fight against, it is certain that Nabucco was born under a lucky star.' The story of the captivity of the Jews in Babylonia became a breakthrough throughout Italy, not least because Italians felt dominated by foreign powers in the age of nationalism.

 elgar.224.f: "Aida is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni, based on a scenario often attributed to French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, although it has been argued that the scenario was actually written by Temistocle Solera. Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, commissioned Verdi to write the opera, paying him 150,000 francs, but the premiere was delayed. Aida met with great acclaim when it finally opened in Cairo. The costumes and accessories for the premiere were designed by Auguste Mariette, and he oversaw the design and construction of the sets, which were created in Paris and shipped to Cairo. Although Verdi did not attend the premiere in Cairo, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian (and European) premiere, held at La Scala, Milan, and in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere."

 elgar.226.f: "Cavalleria rusticana (Rustic Chivalry) is an opera in one act by Pietro Mascagni to an Italian libretto by Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti and Guido Menasci, and considered one of the classic verismo operas. Although Mascagni had started writing two other operas earlier (Pinotta, premiered in 1932 and Guglielmo Ratcliff, premiered in 1895), Cavalleria rusticana was his first opera to be completed and performed. It remains the best known of his fifteen operas and one operetta. Its success has been phenomenal from its first performance in the Teatro Costanzi in Rome until the present day. At the time of Mascagni's death in 1945, the opera had been performed more than 14,000 times in Italy alone. The first performance of Cavalleria rusticana caused a sensation, with Mascagni taking 40 curtain calls on the opening night, and winning the First Prize."

 elgar.227.f: "Ottorino Respighi was an Italian composer, musicologist and conductor. His musicological interest in 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century music led him to also compose pieces based on the music of this period. He also wrote a number of operas, the best known being La fiamma. He is best known for his orchestral 'Roman trilogy': Fountains of Rome (Le fontane di Roma), Pines of Rome (I pini di Roma), and Roman Festivals (Feste romane). Fountains of Rome is a sinfonic poem, seperated in four sections, depicting one of Rome's fountains during different periods of the day and night. Although the premiere in Rome was unsuccessful, Arturo Toscanini finally conducted the work in Milan in 1918 with tremendous success."

 elgar.228.f: "Giacomo Puccini's operas are among the most frequently performed in the standard repertoire; he is considered the greatest Italian composer of opera after Verdi. While his early work was rooted in traditional late-19th century romantic Italian opera, he successfully developed his work in the 'realistic' verismo style, of which he became one of the leading exponents. Turandot, Puccini's final opera, was left unfinished, and the last two scenes were completed by Franco Alfano based on the composer's sketches. The libretto for Turandot was based on a play by Carlo Gozzi, also called Turandot. The music of the opera is heavily inflected with pentatonic motifs, intended to produce an Asiatic flavor to the music. Unlike La Fanciulla, Turandot contains a number of memorable stand-alone arias, among them Nessun dorma. The first performance was held at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan and conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions."

 elgar.231.t: "Mikhail Glinka"
 elgar.231.d: "Mikhail Glinka was the first great composer in our country to launch Russian opera culture with 'A Life for the Tsar'."
 elgar.231.f: "Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka was the first Russian composer to gain wide recognition within his own country and is often regarded as the fountainhead of Russian classical music. His compositions were an important influence on Russian composers, notably the members of The Five, who produced a distinctive Russian style of music. After years of listening to singers, romancing women with his music, and meeting famous people including Mendelssohn, Berlioz and Liszt, he realized that his life's mission was to return to Russia, write in a Russian manner, and do for Russian music what Donizetti and Bellini had done for Italian music. A Life for the Tsar was the first of Glinka's two great operas. It was originally entitled Ivan Susanin. Set in 1612, it tells the story of the Russian peasant and patriotic hero Ivan Susanin who sacrifices his life for the Tsar by leading astray a group of marauding Poles who were hunting him. With this opera Glinka succeeded in creating an independent Russian music; it is considered the first Russian opera."
 elgar.231.g: "A life for the Tsar, indeed."
 elgar.232.t: "Modest Mussorgsky"
 elgar.232.d: "Modest Mussorgsky, the boldest member of the The Five, made a lasting impression with his opera 'Boris Gudonov'. Some love, others hate the work. At the same time, the music world agrees that it is his most important masterpiece."
 elgar.232.f: "'I both adore and abhor Boris Godunov. I adore it for its originality, power, boldness, distinctiveness, and beauty; I abhor it for its lack of polish, the roughness of its harmonies, and, in some places, the sheer awkwardness of the music.' - Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov"
 elgar.232.g: "A masterpiece!"
 elgar.232.h: "Disgusting."
 elgar.233.t: "Pyotr Tchaikovsky"
 elgar.233.d: "The ballet 'Swan Lake' by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky performed today is only the prelude to numerous masterpieces by this composer, which were soon to be followed by other ballets such as the Nutcracker, the Violin Concerto, the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies and the Overture 1812."
 elgar.233.f: "You just gotta love Tchaikovsky."
 elgar.233.g: "One of the greatest composers of all time."
 elgar.234.t: "Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov"
 elgar.234.d: "Scheherazade, an oriental suite in four movements, was presented to the audience today. The colorful orchestration evokes the world of 1001 Nights."
 elgar.234.f: "Nikolai Andreyevich Rimsky-Korsakov was a member of the group of composers known as The Five and a master of orchestration. His best-known orchestral compositions—Capriccio Espagnol, the Russian Easter Festival Overture, and the symphonic suite Scheherazade—are staples of the classical music repertoire, along with suites and excerpts from some of his 15 operas. Scheherazade is an example of his frequent use of fairy-tale and folk subjects. This orchestral work combines two features typical of Russian music in general and of Rimsky-Korsakov in particular: dazzling, colorful orchestration and an interest in the East, which figured greatly in the history of Imperial Russia, as well as orientalism in general. The name 'Scheherazade' refers to the main character Scheherazade of the One Thousand and One Nights. It is one of Rimsky-Korsakov's most popular works."
 elgar.234.g: "Tell me another story, Scheherazade."
 elgar.235.t: "Alexander Borodin"
 elgar.235.d: "The two composers Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov were able to complete and premiere Alexander Borodin's last masterpiece, the opera 'Prince Igor', a few years after his death."
 elgar.235.f: "Alexander Porfiryevich Borodin was one of the prominent 19th-century composers known as 'The Five', a group dedicated to producing a 'uniquely Russian' kind of classical music. A doctor and chemist by profession and training, Borodin made important early contributions to organic chemistry. Although he is presently known better as a composer, he regarded medicine and science as his primary occupations, only practicing music and composition in his spare time or when he was ill. Borodin is best known for his symphonies, his two string quartets, the symphonic poem In the Steppes of Central Asia and his opera Prince Igor. The composer adapted the libretto from the Ancient Russian epic The Lay of Igor's Host, which recounts the campaign of Rus' prince Igor Svyatoslavich against the invading Cuman ('Polovtsian') tribes in 1185. He also incorporated material drawn from two medieval Kievan chronicles. The opera was left unfinished upon the composer's death in 1887 and was edited and completed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov."
 elgar.235.g: "Borodin's spirit from Glazunov's hand."
  
 elgar.241.t: "Jacques Offenbach"
 elgar.241.d: "With the performance of Oprheus in the underworld, Jacques Offenbach's triumphal procession as king of the operettas begins."
 elgar.241.f: "Jacques Offenbach was a German-born French composer, cellist and impresario of the Romantic period. He is remembered for his nearly 100 operettas from the 1850s to the 1870s, and his uncompleted opera The Tales of Hoffmann. The risqué humor and mostly gentle satiric barbs in these pieces, together with Offenbach's facility for melody, made them internationally known. He was a powerful influence on later composers of the operetta genre, particularly Johann Strauss Jr. and Arthur Sullivan. Orpheus in the Underworld was Offenbach's first full-length opera. The original 1858 production became a box-office success, and ran well into the following year, rescuing Offenbach and his Bouffes company from financial difficulties. The opera is a lampoon of the ancient legend of Orpheus and Eurydice. In this version Orpheus is not the son of Apollo but a rustic violin teacher."
 elgar.241.g: "Can-can for everyone!"
 elgar.242.t: "Camille Saint-Saëns"
 elgar.242.d: "Danse macabre is a tone poem by Camille Saint-Saëns for orchestra. It premiered in 1875."
 elgar.242.f: "Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and expressionist schools of music; he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life."
 elgar.242.g: "Wait, wait ... he is a composer who gives an astronomical bonus, too?"
 elgar.243.t: "Georges Bizet"
 elgar.243.d: "A new opera called 'Carmen' by Georges Bizet has met with little public interest. It remains doubtful whether this composition will ever have any meaning."
 elgar.243.f: "Georges Bizet was a French Romantic composer whose opera Carmen became one of the greatest successes in operatic history. The work is based on Prosper Mérimée's 1846 novella of the same name. Carmen, initially not accepted by the public, received praise from famous contemporaries such as Debussy, Nietzsche, Saint-Saëns and Tchaikovsky. Brahms attended over twenty performances and considered it the finest opera performed in Europe since the Franco-Prussian War. Bizet died only a few months after the premiere and was not to receive any fame for his works throughout his life. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre."
 elgar.243.g: "What a tragic fate!"
 elgar.244.t: "Claude Debussy"
 elgar.244.d: "Claude Debussy today presented a symphonic poem based on the poem L'après-midi d'un faune by Stéphane Mallarmé. It is considered a masterpiece of impressionist music and a turning point in western music history."
 elgar.244.f: "Claude Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is sometimes seen as the first Impressionist composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, Pelléas et Mélisande. His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his 'symphonic sketches', La mer. His tone poem Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune is considered one of the key works of modern music."
 elgar.244.g: "Indulge, dream, enjoy the never-ending moment..."
 elgar.245.t: "Maurice Ravel"
 elgar.245.d: "With his choreographic symphony 'Daphnis et Chloé', Maurice Ravel has established himself as one of France's leading composers."
 elgar.245.f: "Joseph Maurice Ravel is often associated with Impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy, although both composers rejected the term. He was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries. Some of his piano music, such as Gaspard de la Nuit, is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chloé require skilful balance in performance. In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer."
 elgar.245.g: "Monsieur Ravel, with his impressionist ecstasy, will certainly never become famous for a monotonous, boring, repetitive work."
  
 elgar.251.t: "Arthur Sullivan"
 elgar.251.d: "The latest piece by the duo Gilbert & Sullivan conquers the British and American-speaking world. The 'Mikado' will go down in history as one of the most successful comic operas!"
 elgar.251.f: "Savoy opera was a style of comic opera that developed in Victorian England in the late 19th century, with W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan as the original and most successful practitioners. The name is derived from the Savoy Theatre, which impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte built to house the Gilbert and Sullivan pieces, and later those by other composer–librettist teams. Gilbert, who wrote the libretti for these operas, created fanciful 'topsy-turvy' worlds where each absurdity is taken to its logical conclusion. Sullivan, six years Gilbert's junior, composed the music, contributing memorable melodies that could convey both humor and pathos. Gilbert and Sullivan introduced innovations in content and form that directly influenced the development of musical theater through the 20th century. The most successful of the Savoy Operas was 'The Mikado', which made fun of English bureaucracy, thinly disguised by a Japanese setting. The story focuses on a 'cheap tailor', Ko-Ko, who is promoted to the position of Lord High Executioner of the town of Titipu."
 elgar.251.g: "I've got a little list — I've got a little list"
 elgar.251.h: "Of society offenders who might well be underground"
 elgar.251.i: "And who never would be missed — who never would be missed!"
 elgar.252.t: "Edward Elgar"
 elgar.252.d: "By performing his 'Pomp and Circumstance' marches, Edward Elgar not only wrote musical history, but also created pieces significant to British identity."
 elgar.252.f: "Sir Edward William Elgar's works  have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Elgar's best-known works were composed within the twenty-one years between 1899 and 1920. The Enigma Variations made Elgar's name nationally. The variation form was ideal for him at this stage of his career, when his comprehensive mastery of orchestration was still in contrast to his tendency to write his melodies in short, sometimes rigid, phrases. When Pomp & Circumstance had its premiere, it was a 'frantic' success. The central part is also known around the world as the anthem Land of Hope and Glory and is considered the main unofficial anthem of the United Kingdom; the play is a highlight of the annual Last Night of the Proms."
 elgar.252.g: "Land of Hope and Glory!"
 elgar.253.t: "Ralph Vaughan Williams"
 elgar.253.d: "Ralph Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis is a response to the continent's musical influences that have prevailed for far too long."
 elgar.253.f: "Vaughan Williams did not achieve wide recognition early in his career as a composer, but by 1910, in his late thirties, he was gaining a reputation. e composed what his biographer James Day calls 'unquestionably the first work by Vaughan Williams that is recognizably and unmistakably his and no one else's'. It is based on a tune by the 16th-century English composer Thomas Tallis, which Vaughan Williams had come across while editing the English Hymnal, published in 1906. Previously, Vaughan Williams had absorbed his most significant influences from France in order to subsequently create an English style of music that was to break away in particular from the 'Teutonic influence' of Richard Wagner. His later symphonic work should finally bring him worldwide fame."
 elgar.253.g: "England has invented its own style!"
 elgar.254.t: "Gustav Holst"
 elgar.254.d: "'The Planets' by Gustav Holst are among the most famous masterpieces of British compositional art of the 19th and 20th centuries."
 elgar.254.f: "Gustav Theodore Holst is best known for his orchestral suite The Planets, but composed many other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. In 1895, shortly after celebrating his twenty-first birthday, Holst met Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend and had more influence on Holst's music than anybody else. Holst's absorption of folksong, not only in the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. Holst's works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure."
 elgar.254.g: "Well, that was a planetary good suite."
  
 elgar.261.t: "Antonín Dvořák"
 elgar.261.d: "One of the greatest symphonies of all time, the 9th ('From the New World') by Antonín Dvořák, had its premiere today in New York."
 elgar.261.f: "Antonín Leopold Dvořák was a Czech composer. Dvořák frequently employed rhythms and other aspects of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia, following the Romantic-era nationalist example of his predecessor Bedřich Smetana. His versatile work includes nine symphonies and numerous other orchestral works, operas, vocal music, chamber music as well as piano and organ pieces; the Slavonian Dances are the most famous of them.In 1892, Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. While in the United States, Dvořák wrote his two most successful orchestral works: the Symphony From the New World, which spread his reputation worldwide. It has been said that Dvořák was inspired by the 'wide open spaces' of America, such as prairies he may have seen on his trip to Iowa in the summer of 1893. At the premiere in Carnegie Hall, the end of every movement was met with thunderous clapping and Dvořák felt obliged to stand up and bow."
 elgar.261.g: "That was the most wonderful music this continent has ever heard!"
 elgar.262.t: "John Philip Sousa"
 elgar.262.d: "Sousa comes marching over."
 elgar.262.f: "John Philip Sousa is known as 'The March King' or the 'American March King', to distinguish him from his British counterpart Kenneth J. Alford. Sousa began his career playing violin and studying music theory and composition under John Esputa and George Felix Benkert. His father enlisted him in the United States Marine Band as an apprentice in 1868. He left the band in 1875, and over the next five years, he performed as a violinist and learned to conduct. In 1880 he rejoined the Marine Band, and he served there for 12 years as director. Among his best-known marches are 'The Stars and Stripes Forever' (National March of the United States of America), 'Semper Fidelis' (official march of the United States Marine Corps), 'The Liberty Bell' and 'The Thunderer'."
 elgar.262.g: "Stars & Stripes forever!"
 elgar.263.t: "George Gershwin"
 elgar.263.d: "With his 'Rhapsody in Blue', George Gershwin guides American music between jazz, classical and mass entertainment."
 elgar.263.f: "George Gershwin was an American composer, pianist and conductor. His compositions include both classical and popular music. His best-known works include the orchestral compositions Rhapsody in Blue and An American in Paris, and the opera Porgy and Bess. In 1924 Gershwin began writing Rhapsody in Blue for two pianos. Ferde Grofé moved in with him for the duration of the composition and created the score for Whiteman's jazz orchestra from the piano version. The concert of Paul Whiteman's orchestra in New York's Aeolian Hall on was a historic event of immense importance at which Gershwin's composition was premiered. Gershwin has composed plays for both Broadway and classical concerts."
 elgar.263.g: "This is true American music."
 elgar.264.t: "Aaron Copland"
 elgar.264.d: "Copland performed a symphony of only fifteen minutes. Some critics later thanked him for it."
 elgar.264.f: "Aaron Copland is regarded as one of the most important representatives of American modernism, and he particularly loved stage music. After expressionist-experimental early works, he turned to a clearly understandable, rhythmically influenced tonal style that included folk songs, marches and dances; like Copland, many composers during the Great Depression resented writing music for the elite. Copland's second period began around 1936 when he composed the works Billy the Kid and El Salón México. Fanfare for the Common Man, scored for brass and percussion and commissioned by the conductor Eugène Goossens in 1942, is quite possibly Copland's best-known work. The Short Symphony, premiered in 1933, was still marked by the transition from the elitist to the popular phase."
 elgar.264.g: "It's a shame that the timeframe ends before the Appalachian spring suite."
  
 elgar.271.t: "Isaac Albéniz"
 elgar.271.d: "Isaac Albéniz is one of the first great Spanish composers after a century of Spain's relatively low profile in European musical culture."
 elgar.271.f: "Isaac Manuel Francisco Albéniz y Pascual began his career as a child prodigy at the piano with the first public concert at which he improvised at the age of four. At the age of six he was to continue his piano studies at the Paris Conservatory with Antoine François Marmontel. At the age of twelve he escaped as a stowaway on a ship to America bound for Puerto Rico. When he went to Havana in the Spanish colony of Cuba a year later, he was already traveling with a small fortune of 10,000 francs that he had earned on his tour of South America. By 1904, Albéniz had composed hundreds of salon pieces for piano. Above all, the playing technique and timbre of the guitar can be identified time and again as a source of musical inspiration in the composer's work. Albéniz secured fame with the Suite española and the extensive piano cycle Iberia."
 elgar.271.g: "Leyenda will be a legend."
 elgar.272.t: "Enrique Granados"
 elgar.272.d: "With Enrique Granados, Isaac Albéniz is joined by another innovator in Spanish music."
 elgar.272.f: "Enrique Granados y Campiña was a Spanish composer and pianist. Enrique Granados is regarded as the pioneer of a generation of pianists that is sometimes referred to as the Catalan school of pianists. Along with Pedrell's two other important students, Isaac Albéniz and Manuel de Falla, Granados is one of the great innovators of Spanish music. He mainly wrote songs and piano works. His operas, zarzuelas and the symphonic poems stand behind the piano music in their importance. Here the Danzas españolas, the Valses Poeticos and the Goyescas occupy the predominant place. The piano cycle Goyescas, for which Granados was inspired by paintings by the painter Francisco de Goya and describes the life of the people in Goya's time. The Goyescas are among Granados' most virtuoso piano compositions. The most famous play is Quejas ó la Maja y el Ruiseñor."
 elgar.272.g: "Spain has its composers, too."
 elgar.273.t: "Manuel de Falla"
 elgar.273.d: "The performance of 'El amor brujo' in Madrid underscores Spain's return to the international music world - largely thanks to the compositional work of Manuel de Falla."
 elgar.273.f: "Manuel de Falla y Matheu has a claim to being Spain's greatest composer of the 20th century, although the number of pieces he composed was relatively modest. Falla moved to Paris in 1907, where he remained for seven years. There he met a number of composers who had an influence on his style, including Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy and Paul Dukas, as well as Igor Stravinsky, Florent Schmitt, Isaac Albéniz and the impresario Sergei Diaghilev. Back in Madrid he composed several of his best-known pieces, including the ballet El amor brujo and El sombrero de tres picos."
 elgar.273.g: "Ah, the fire dance!"
  
 elgar.281.t: "Antônio Carlos Gomes"
 elgar.281.d: "Antônio Carlos Gomes spent his life in Italy for several years and benefited from the opera culture there - and got involved in it. With the premiere of Il Guarany, he managed for the first time that a Brazilian composer was accepted as an equal in Europe."
 elgar.281.f: "Antônio Carlos Gomes was the first New World composer whose work was accepted by Europe. He was the only non-European who was successful as an opera composer in Italy, during the "golden age of opera", contemporary to Verdi and Puccini and the first composer of non-European lineage to be accepted into the Classic tradition of music. Carlos Gomes achieved his first major success in a time when the Italian audiences were eager for a new name to celebrate and Puccini had not yet officially started his career. Interested in composing an opera which dealt with a truly Brazilian subject, Carlos Gomes chose as the theme of his next work the romance novel O Guarani, by Brazilian writer José de Alencar. The opera was given an Indian subject and setting and it premiered in May 1870 at the La Scala Theater in Milan as Il Guarany. The success was enormous. Even the most strict musical critics compared the Brazilian musician to the great European maestros, such as Rossini and Verdi."
 elgar.281.g: "A world-class Brazilian composer."
 elgar.282.t: "Jean Sibelius"
 elgar.282.d: "With Finlandia, the composer Jean Sibelius not only arouses patriotic feelings. With him, Finland has managed to gain acceptance in the musical ranks of Europe."
 elgar.282.f: "Johan Julius Christian ('Jean') Sibelius was a Finnish composer at the transition from late romantic to modern. He is widely regarded as his country's greatest composer, and his music is often credited with having helped Finland develop a national identity. Sibelius is widely known for his symphonies and his tone poems, especially Finlandia and the Karelia suite. His reputation in Finland grew in the 1890s with the choral symphony Kullervo, which like many subsequent pieces drew on the epic poem Kalevala. His First Symphony was first performed to an enthusiastic audience in 1899 at a time when Finnish nationalism was evolving. In addition to six more symphonies, he gained popularity at home and abroad with incidental music and more tone poems, especially En saga, The Swan of Tuonela and Valse triste. Sibelius exerted considerable influence on symphonic composers and musical life, at least in English-speaking and Nordic countries."
 elgar.282.g: "Finland finds its own musical path."

 elgar.283.d: "The first true Mexican opera has had its world premiere today in Mexico City."
 elgar.283.f: "Aniceto de los Dolores Luis Gonzaga Ortega del Villar was a Mexican physician, composer, and pianist. Although he had a distinguished career as a physician and surgeon, he is remembered today for his  opera Guatimotzin. Guatimotzin is an opera in one act and nine scenes composed by Aniceto Ortega del Villar to a libretto in Spanish by José Tomás de Cuéllar. It premiered on 13 September 1871 at the Gran Teatro Nacional in Mexico City. Described as an episodio musical (musical episode), its plot is based on the defense of Mexico by its last Aztec emperor, Cuauhtémoc (also known as Guatimotzin). It was one of the earliest Mexican operas to use a native subject. "

 elgar.284.d: "Tango interpreter Carlos Gardel has recorded his first record hit with Mi noche triste."
 elgar.284.f: "Carlos Gardel was the most prominent figure in the history of tango. He was one of the most influential interpreters of world popular music in the first half of the 20th century. Gardel is the most famous popular tango singer of all time and is recognized throughout the world. He created the tango-canción in 1917 with his rendition of Pascual Contursi and Samuel Castriota's Mi noche triste. With 'Mi noche triste', the birth of sentimental tango took place. Nostalgic, melodramatic, and sad, the new lyrics and the music embodied Buenos Aires and its people."

 elgar.285.t: "Bedřich Smetana"
 elgar.285.d: "With 'The Moldau' Smetana wrote one of the most famous orchestral pieces in music history."
 elgar.285.f: "Bedřich Smetana was a Czech composer who pioneered the development of a musical style that became closely identified with his people's aspirations to a cultural and political 'revival'. He has been regarded in his homeland as the father of Czech music. Internationally he is best known for his 1866 opera The Bartered Bride and for the symphonic cycle Má vlast, which portrays the history, legends and landscape of the composer's native Bohemia. It contains the famous symphonic poem 'Vltava', also popularly known by its German name 'Die Moldau' (in English, 'The Moldau'), depicting the river that runs through Prague towards its junction with the Elbe."

 elgar.286.d: "The opera Bluebeard's Castle by Béla Bartók premiered in Budapest."
 elgar.286.f: "Béla Viktor János Bartók is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century. Through his collection and analytical study of folk music, he was one of the founders of comparative musicology, which later became ethnomusicology. The music of Richard Strauss, whom he met in 1902 at the Budapest premiere of Also sprach Zarathustra, strongly influenced his early work. From 1907, he also began to be influenced by the French composer Claude Debussy. Although Bartók claimed in his writings that his music was always tonal, he rarely uses the chords or scales of tonality, and so the descriptive resources of tonal theory are of limited use. He rarely used the simple aggregate actively to shape musical structure, though there are notable examples such as the second theme from the first movement of his Second Violin Concerto, commenting that he 'wanted to show Schoenberg that one can use all twelve tones and still remain tonal'."

 elgar.289.d: "With the 'Reisado do Pastoreio' Oscar Lorenzo Fernández has completed his most famous masterpiece."
 elgar.289.f: "Oscar Lorenzo Fernández was a Brazilian composer of the nationalist phase. His relatively small work is characterized by formal refinement. The Trio Brasileiro, from 1924, for piano, violin and cello, was a landmark. In 1936, he founded the Brazilian Conservatory of Music, which he directed until his death in 1948. He composed an opera (Malazarte after José Pereira Graça Aranha, 1931-1933), a ballet, two symphonies, five symphonic poems, two orchestral suites, a piano and a violin concerto, chamber music works, piano pieces, choirs and songs. One of his most famous works is Reisado do pastoreio with his Batuque, a dance of Afro-Caribbean origin. It was composed in 1930."

Attention rests on a small gesture, which, however, has explosive power. A traveling composer dedicated a sonata to a married lady and gave her the original score as a gift. However, the woman is the wife of a highly respected general in our army. The gift has sparked speculation and could damage the man's public image. The military demands action."
 elgar.303.g: "I do not see the problem?"
 elgar.303.h: "Outrageous!"
 elgar.304.t: "An evening reception"
 elgar.304.d: "Our monarch has invited a traveling composer to a princely reception. The composer showed his gratitude with a composition."
 elgar.304.f: "Although musical culture in the 19th century increasingly sought to free itself from patronage, nobles and kings were still at the forefront of patronage of the arts, and many musical works were still dedicated to princes and kings. On the other hand, the personal relationship often meant that composers who were excluded from academies and art circles were able to find support from a wealthy patron if they suited his personal taste. A whole series of Wagner's masterpieces, for example, would not have been possible without the personal support of King Ludwig II of Bavaria."
 elgar.304.g: "What a beautiful surprise!"
 elgar.305.t: "Sold out!"
 elgar.305.d: "A row over a sold-out performance by a great composer has sparked a public outcry!"
 elgar.305.f: "On the day of a premiere, a large crowd had gathered expectantly in front of the opera house, which had been sold out for days; even the composer who appeared could only get a ticket on the black market. However, since a theater employee had sold additional tickets himself, the tickets sold far exceeded the number of seats. There were tumultuous scenes in and in front of the theater in which the music was almost completely lost; those outside yelled to be let in, those inside cried out for quiet. The opening choruses could still be performed, but then the orchestra gave up, which was when the racket really started."
 elgar.305.g: "Who is responsible for that?!"
 elgar.306.t: "Sursprising premiere"
 elgar.306.d: "The work of a composer who failed in his home country has captured the hearts of our audience."
 elgar.306.f: "There have always been cases in which the premiere of famous works failed. Such experiences often led not only to serious self-doubt and the end of a career, but also to an attempt to perform the same play for a different audience. Later classics often only prevailed on the second or third attempt. Not the place of the premiere, but the place of success was then remembered as the actual initial spark. Hector Berlioz is an example of a composer who enjoyed greater success with his works in Britain and Germany than at home in France."
 elgar.306.g: "Our audience is more grateful."
 elgar.307.t: "Musical friendship"
 elgar.307.d: "A traveling composer got along with his fellow musicians on site straight away."
 elgar.307.f: "The relationship between foreign and resident musicians was not always easy. It wasn't just national resentment and personal prejudice. Some orchestras could not work with the conducting style of a guest conductor, sometimes the short-term nature of performances required compromises, for which the guest in turn blamed the local music world. Many a local composer or conductor also feared the influence of foreigners would be too great. However, despite all these obstacles, friendships continued to grow."
 elgar.307.g: "A fruitful freindship."
 elgar.308.t: "Musical rivalry"
 elgar.308.d: "The local music world views the appearance of a traveling composer with resentment and suspicion."
 elgar.308.f: "'Two great works for the Opera, two more for the Renaissance, two more for the Opera-Comique, and yet another for the Theatre Italien? It seems that Monsieur Donizetti treats us like a conquered country, it's a real invasion. One can no longer speak of the opera houses of Paris, but only of the opera houses of Monsieur Donizetti.' - Hector Berlioz"
 elgar.308.g: "These musicians should pull themselves together!"
 elgar.309.t: "Inspirations"
 elgar.309.d: "A foreign composer has inspired the members of the state orchestra."
 elgar.309.f: "Outside influence has often made a difference in the local and national music world. Unfamiliar pieces, a foreign musical language or the appearance of a charismatic musician could often lead to the local musicians gaining a completely new perspective."
 elgar.309.g: "Inspiration? I want to see results!"
 elgar.309.h: "This will have a positive effect on the orchestra."
 elgar.310.t: "Mania"
 elgar.310.d: "The appearance of a composer has led to an unprecedented, almost hysterical public enthusiasm for his work. People have nothing else in mind!"
 elgar.310.f: "'When formerly I heard of the fainting spells which broke out in Germany and specially in Berlin, when Liszt showed himself there, I shrugged my shoulders pityingly and thought: quiet sabbatarian Germany does not wish to lose the opportunity of getting the little necessary exercise permitted it... In their case, thought I, it is a matter of the spectacle for the spectacle's sake...Thus I explained this Lisztomania, and looked on it as a sign of the politically unfree conditions existing beyond the Rhine. Yet I was mistaken, after all, and I did not notice it until last week, at the Italian Opera House, where Liszt gave his first concert...This was truly no Germanically sentimental, sentimentalizing Berlinate audience, before which Liszt played, quite alone, or rather, accompanied solely by his genius. And yet, how convulsively his mere appearance affected them! How boisterous was the applause which rang to meet him!... What acclaim it was! A veritable insanity, one unheard of in the annals of furore!' - Heinrich Heine"
 elgar.310.g: "So, they are completely distracted?"
 elgar.311.t: "Music brings people together"
 elgar.311.d: "An ambassador asks if we can get him a ticket to a concert by a composer who is staying with us."
 elgar.311.f: "The ambassador of a great power is a lover of a traveling composer who is currently visiting our country. He would like to attend a performance, but there are no more seats available. He has therefore asked us to use our political influence so that he can still attend the performance."
 elgar.311.g: "Haha. No."
 elgar.311.h: "Give him pride of place."
 elgar.312.t: "Assassination attempt at the Opera!"
 elgar.312.d: "A terrible assassination attempt on a leading politician in our country overshadowed today's opera performance!"
 elgar.312.f: "For some time now, the lack of legitimacy in our government has caused dissatisfaction among the population. A sneaky assassin took advantage of a popular composer's concert to shoot a high-ranking government official during the performance. [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_leader_victim').GetFullName] was seriously injured. The perpetrator is still on the run, the life-threateningly injured victim was immediately taken to the nearest hospital."
 elgar.312.g: "Where were the security forces?!"
 elgar.313.t: "A minor work"
 elgar.313.d: "A small work composed by the great composer in our country may not be a big hit, but it has found its fans."
 elgar.313.f: "Occasional works by composers that were created apart from the famous works did not have to be of average quality at the same time. Time and time again, small pieces have managed to attract more attention than many a life's work. Despite his wealth of work, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov is famous in pop culture for The 'Flight of the Bumblebee' (from Tsar Saltan) and Edvard Grieg for 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' (from Peer Gynt) - wrongly so, but a music hit is a music hit."
 elgar.313.g: "Sometimes it's the little things that bring joy."
 elgar.314.t: "No inspiration"
 elgar.314.d: "Disappointingly, our guest finds staying in our country completely uninspiring."
 elgar.314.f: "Sometimes it just doesn't work."
 elgar.314.g: "Depressing."
 elgar.315.t: "Private Concert"
 elgar.315.d: "Apart from the official performances, our composer gave a private concert in a small circle."
 elgar.315.f: "Small private concerts by great composers have a long tradition. Most famous for this is Franz Schubert with the Schubertiades named after him. At the first Schubertiades Franz Schubert played the piano, and the baritones Johann Michael Vogl and later Carl von Schönstein sang his songs. The evenings also included readings and witty entertainment games, which often had a specific theme. These were a mixture of friendly meetings and literary-musical salon."
 elgar.315.g: "That was nice."
 elgar.315.h: "Da capo!"
 elgar.316.t: "A talented student"
 elgar.316.d: "The great composer in our country has discovered the talent of one of our country's political leaders and has considered instructing him in his art of composition."
 elgar.316.f: "One might be surprised that politicians are capable of artistic talent at all, and that, as bad people, they shouldn't in principle be completely insensitive to any musical art. There were certainly composers with political ambitions, but far fewer politicians with musical ambitions. Whatever might be possessed by this politician, perhaps his soul is not irretrievably lost after all."
 elgar.316.g: "A promising candidate."
 elgar.316.h: "His energy is better spent elsewhere."
 elgar.317.t: "Musical desaster"
 elgar.317.d: "A performance in one of our concert halls could go down as one of the biggest failures in our music history."
 elgar.317.f: "The orchestra was unprepared, the soloist caught a cold, the conductor wasn't rested and the composer, in whose presence the performance took place, is threatening to cancel our country from his next tour. There's no other way to describe it than a disaster!"
 elgar.317.g: "An international disgrace!"
 elgar.318.t: "Scandal concert"
 elgar.318.d: "A scandalous concert, which simply got the audience up in arms with its 'modern' sounds, not only splits society, but also has legal consequences."
 elgar.318.f: "Press reports at the time speak of tumultuous riots. The composer's followers, his students and opponents shouted at each other, threw at each other, disrupted the performance, destroyed the furniture, etc. Several times, outraged conservatives from the audience climbed the stage cursing to slap the conductor. When he threatened that order would be created with the help of public authority, the tumult is said to have really started. Then there was a slap in the face. In the subsequent judicial sequel, an operetta composer who was present stated: the clapping of the slaps 'was the most melodious thing one could hear that evening'."
 elgar.318.g: "The rabble has no sense of culture. That was excellent!"
 elgar.318.h: "Remove the piece from the board immediately."
 elgar.319.t: "Zeitgeist"
 elgar.319.d: "The modern piece, which a great composer personally conducted today, hits the taste of the masses exactly."
 elgar.319.f: "Sometimes you just have to be lucky."
 elgar.319.g: "Excellent!"
 elgar.320.t: "Musical Propaganda"
 elgar.320.d: "Some government politicians are considering whether the music of the composer who is currently staying with us could be ... borrowed for propaganda purposes."
 elgar.320.f: "Especially from the beginning of the 20th century and the mass society that produced the totalitarian regimes of the time, the idea of making the masses docile through music prevailed. While some musicians resisted the dictatorship even in these times, there were others who put their work directly at the service of an ideology, or at least allowed their talent to be put at the service of a political direction."
 elgar.320.g: "Music should be free from politics."
 elgar.320.h: "Sometimes, music should serve politics."
 elgar.321.t: "Great composers among themselves"
 elgar.321.d: "Our musical guest met a great composer employed by our country. In hour-long conversations and walks, they exchanged musical thoughts and ideas."
 elgar.321.f: "Great minds think alike."
 elgar.321.g: "A historic meeting."

 elgar.416.g: "I had a script plot about an archaeologist looking for the Ark of the Covenant long ago, but then it got stolen."
  
 elgar.422.d: "Our composer is currently suffering from a massive writing block."
 elgar.423.t: "A walk"
 elgar.423.d: "On a walk in nature, [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] found some inspiration that advanced his work."
 elgar.423.f: "Nature has already inspired many composers. Beethoven withdrew to the countryside and collected impressions there that later inspired him to write the 6th symphony. Gustav Mahler even set up his own little composer's cottage."
 elgar.423.g: "In the footsteps of Beethoven."
 elgar.424.t: "Disturbances"
 elgar.424.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] has been trying to compose for some time, but due to his political commitments, he keeps getting interrupted by a certain person."
 elgar.424.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] is not just a composer. In addition to his obligation as chief conductor, he also fulfills his other duties, which are currently suffering even more than usual. In addition, there are some extremely intrusive figures in his life right now. Of course: [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] could only use this denigration to publicly discredit an unwelcome party. On the other hand, his work is likely to be delayed even further if he is not sufficiently sealed off from disturbing influences."
 elgar.424.g: "Don't disturb him!"

 elgar.425.t: "Not enough comfort"
 elgar.425.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] complains that his working conditions are not good enough in view of his multiple office functions. Perhaps monetary supports could improve his 'inspiration'."
 elgar.425.f: "As soon as you give artists an important job, they come with special requests. A serious public figure quickly becomes a diva if you make her feel important. Before you know it, fame is going to these people's heads."
 elgar.425.g: "Give him comfort"
 elgar.426.t: "Sea Shanty"
 elgar.426.d: "As would be foreseeable for an experienced man at sea, [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] wrote a little sea shanty on the side."
 elgar.426.f: "The original practical purpose of the shanty as a work song has always been paramount among seafarers. Linguistic and musical aspects, on the other hand, hardly played a role. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, faster ships were needed. The big-bellied East Indiamen disappeared and were replaced by clippers and frigates. This ultimately led to the shanties gradually losing their practical use for seafaring and being sung only for leisure and entertainment. Musicians collected old sea shanties or were inspired by them to create their own works."
 elgar.426.g: "Yo Ho!"
 elgar.427.t: "March"
 elgar.427.d: "As would be foreseeable for a general, [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] wrote a new military march."
 elgar.427.f: "The march flourished especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries with its nationalistic and militaristic tendencies and its revolutions. An example of this is Gioachino Rossini, who not only regularly incorporated pompous marches into his operas, but also composed a number of pieces for individual princes: including a commissioned composition for the Turkish Sultan Abdülmecid I (Marcia per il Sultano), which is still regularly performed on the program of Italian military bands. Also exemplary for the tendencies of the 19th century is the production of the Strauss family in Vienna, who composed a march at every suitable opportunity to demonstrate patriotism or loyalty to the emperor, or to honor military figures."
 elgar.427.g: "New material for the army."
 elgar.428.t: "Kunstlied"
 elgar.428.d: "Based on the poem of a great poet, [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] has written a Kunstlied as a side work."
 elgar.428.f: "In Western classical music tradition, Lied is a term for setting poetry to classical music to create a piece of polyphonic music. The term is used for any kind of song in contemporary German, but among English and French speakers, lied is often used interchangeably with 'art song' to encompass works that the tradition has inspired in other languages as well. The poems that have been made into lieder often center on pastoral themes or themes of romantic love."
 elgar.428.g: "Couldn't it have been something else...?"
 elgar.429.t: "Piano Sonata"
 elgar.429.d: "Piano pieces are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. As finger exercise for his next major work, [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] wrote a sonata and performed it last night at a small evening party."
 elgar.429.f: "In the early 19th century, the sonata form was defined, from a combination of previous practice and the works of important Classical composers, particularly Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, but composers such as Clementi also. It is during this period that the differences between the three- and the four-movement layouts became a subject of commentary, with emphasis on the concerto being laid out in three movements, and the symphony in four. Among works expressly labeled sonata for the piano, there are the three of Frédéric Chopin, those of Felix Mendelssohn, the three of Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt's Sonata in B minor, and later the sonatas of Johannes Brahms and Sergei Rachmaninoff."
 elgar.429.g: "A classic"
 elgar.431.t: "Violin Concerto"
 elgar.431.d: "After several months of effort and artistic creativity, [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName] premiered his Violin Concerto today with him at the podium."
 elgar.431.f: "A violin concerto is an instrumental concerto for violin as a solo instrument and orchestra. As a genre of instrumental music, the first works emerged from the concerto grosso at the beginning of the 18th century. It finds its full expression in the classical period. It is usually in three movements, with a slow movement in the middle."
 elgar.432.t: "Symphony"
 elgar.432.d: "A very special performance is taking place in the Philharmonie tonight: high society has gathered to attend the premiere of [SCOPE.sCharacter('elgar_conductor').GetFullName]'s new symphony."
 elgar.432.f: "A symphony is a term for instrumental works of varying form and instrumentation over the centuries. The classic form of the symphony developed in the 18th century and maintained a dominant position in the field of orchestral music well into the 20th century. This is a work consisting of several (usually three or four, more rarely five) movements for orchestra without soloists. Since Ludwig van Beethoven's 9th symphony, vocal parts (soloists and/or choir) have also occasionally appeared, for example in Gustav Mahler, although the role of the orchestra remains dominant."
  
 elgar.441.t: "Conductor travels to Neighbour Country"

 elgar.443.f: "'In Austria everyone becomes what they are not.' - Gustav Mahler"
 elgar.443.g: "Hope they don't poach him."
 elgar.444.t: "Unsuccessful conductor"
 elgar.444.d: "Our chief conductor didn't get the expected applause on his last tour stop."
 elgar.444.f: "'Life when one first arrives is a continual mortification as one's romantic illusions are successively shattered and the musical treasure-house of one's imagination crumbles before the hopelessness of the reality. Every day fresh experiences bring fresh disappointments.' - Hector Berlioz"
 elgar.444.g: "Disappointing."
  
 elgar.1001.t: "Controversy over Poliuto"
 elgar.1001.d: "An irreconcilable dispute between the king and the composer Donizetti threatens to trigger his dismissal."
 elgar.1001.f: "From 1829 to 1838 Gaetano Donizetti was music director of the Royal Theaters of Naples and, despite travels and commissions in other states, de facto the most important cultural figure of the kingdom and its most famous representative. A whole series of famous Donizetti operas were written in Naples, which consolidated the position of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies as a top-ranking music location. But despite the many successes, Donizetti had to fight again and again with the Neapolitan censorship, which defaced his libretti or canceled entire operas. In the most recent dispute, the king himself intervened to prevent the performance of the opera 'Poliuto'. After many years of quarrels with the censorship, Donizetti has grown weary and has made preparations to flee to Paris. The political elite has united behind the king; preventing Donizetti from his plans would not only upset the political and social landscape, but would also massively damage the king's authority and reputation."
 elgar.1001.g: "The king has spoken, he may pack his things."
 elgar.1001.h: "We must do everything to prevent Donizetti from leaving!"
 elgar.1011.t: "Donizetti arrives in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 elgar.1011.d: "A great composer stopped in our country on his current tour and decided to stay for a while."
 elgar.1011.f: "Alongside Gioachino Rossini, Vincenzo Bellini and Giuseppe Verdi, Gaetano Donizetti is considered the most important Italian composer of the 19th century. With around 70 operas, he achieved great fame throughout Europe during his lifetime and was described as the master of bel canto. Born in Bergamo, he first celebrated his greatest successes in Italy, until he looked elsewhere for more favorable conditions for his works due to increasing censorship. Before Donizetti, comic operas in particular had enjoyed great success, with Donizetti the Gecshmakc changed again in the direction of opera seria. Donizetti's operatic output is extraordinarily diverse and ranges stylistically from a late classical idiom in his early work, which still shows influences from Simon Mayr and Rossini, to the high romanticism on the threshold of Verdi, to whom Donizetti owes a lot."
 elgar.1011.g: "Welcome, welcome!"
 elgar.1011.h: "Hire this brilliant man!"
 elgar.1012.t: "Donizetti departs"
 elgar.1012.d: "After some time of stay, a great composer decided to leave [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to continue his tour."
 elgar.1012.f: "Composers on tour make the length of their stay dependent on various factors. The existence and size of an opera house are decisive factors. Composers can even be recruited upon their arrival - provided a country has a rich musical tradition, a major opera house and the most modern music technology."
 elgar.1012.g: "Hope to see you again soon!"
 elgar.1021.t: "Donizetti's contract ends"
 elgar.1021.d: "A contract with a great composer has expired. If we don't offer better conditions, he will leave the country."
 elgar.1021.f: "Great composers can be signed for ten years, after which they have the option to tour again and settle elsewhere. It is possible to extend the contract once, but maintenance will be more expensive. An extension takes another ten years. After that, the composer will finally move on."
 elgar.1021.g: "We wish him all the best."
 elgar.1021.h: "We should extend his contract with better terms."
 elgar.1022.t: "Donizetti leaves [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 elgar.1022.d: "After 20 years in the service of our country, a great composer sees his part of the obligation as done and wants to travel the world again independently."
 elgar.1022.f: "A great composer spends a maximum of twenty years in the same place. After that, there is no possibility of a contract extension - after all, this is in their very own career interests."
 elgar.1031.t: "Donizetti dies"
 elgar.1031.d: "The great composer passed away today. A great loss for the music world!"
 elgar.1031.f: "It took a full 17 months for Donizetti to be rescued from the mental asylum. A planned departure was prevented by doctors, but also by the police prefect of Paris for inscrutable reasons. Only with the help of diplomatic pressure could the now completely apathetic composer be brought back by his brother Francesco and his nephew Andrea. The daughter of Baroness Rosa Rota-Basoni played the piano for the composer every day and sang arias from his works, his friend Dolci spoke to him in the Bergamasque dialect and he received a visit from the tenor Rubini, but Donizetti showed no more reactions. Donizetti died a week after an apoplectic stroke with hemiplegia, high fever and subsequent infections. Autopsy results showed symptoms of 'past' meningitis and a partially damaged, inflamed spinal cord."
 elgar.1031.g: "A tragic death."
 elgar.1032.f: "Gaetano Donizetti passed away peacefully this morning after a long and fulfilling life in the arms of his second wife and surrounded by his sons. A funeral procession with several bands, hundreds of torchbearers and thousands of spectators marks the farewell for a man who is said to have lived a perfect life."
 elgar.1032.g: "A titan of music history has left us."
 elgar.1041.f: "Concert tours were and are a matter of course for musicians, although not every composer has the same desire to travel. There are a multitude of musicians who prefer permanent employment and rarely travel; famous examples such as Liszt or Berlioz, but also exiles such as Rachmaninoff or Prokofiev often underscore their activity as cosmopolitan rather than national artists who felt just as much at home in the world as they did in their home countries. Even composers who were connected to a patron, an ensemble, or simply to their homeland, repeatedly undertook extensive concert tours and then failed to fulfill their obligations to their actual clients. On the other hand, such an absence was also appreciated by clients, since composers abroad increased the reputation of their own country or enriched the musical culture when the composer returned home with new experiences, ideas and inspiration."

 elgar.1051.d: "The Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti has reached Paris and performed his opera 'Les Martyres' there, which was extremely well received by the public."
 elgar.1051.f: "Poliuto is a three-act tragedia lirica (or tragic opera) by Gaetano Donizetti from the Italian libretto by Salvadore Cammarano, which was based on Pierre Corneille's play Polyeucte written in 1641/42. It reflected the life of the early Christian martyr Saint Polyeuctus. Regarded by one author as Donizetti's "most personal opera" with the music being "some of the finest Donizetti was to compose", Poliuto was written in 1838 for performances planned at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples later that year. However, close to the time for rehearsals to begin, King Ferdinand II refused to allow the martyrdom of a Christian saint to be seen on stage and forbade the production. Angry at the decision and with a commission for the Paris Opéra due from the composer, Donizetti paid the penalty to the San Carlo for not producing an original work as a substitute, and left Naples for Paris. As his first commission for Paris, he decided to revise Poliuto and between 1839-40 a French text, with the title Les Martyres."

 elgar.1052.f: "When Donizetti went to Bologna for the Stabat Mater, Rossini attended the third performance, and the two men - each former students of the Bologna Conservatory - met for the first time, with Rossini declaring that Donizetti was 'the only maestro in Italy capable of conducting my Stabat as I would have it'. Friends including his brother-in-law, Antonio Vasselli (known as Totò) - continually attempted to persuade him to take up an academic position in Bologna rather than the Vienna court engagement, if for no other reason that it would give the composer a base from which to work and teach and not be continually exhausting himself with travel between cities. Donizetti reported the public's reaction: 'The enthusiasm is impossible to describe. Even at the final rehearsal, which Rossini attended, in the middle of the day, he was accompanied to his home to the shouting of more than 500 persons. The same thing the first night, under his window, since he did not appear in the hall.'"
 elgar.1053.t: "Donizetti in Vienna"
 elgar.1053.d: "The Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti has reached Vienna and won over the audience with several performances. Rumors are circulating that he is speculating on a position in the Austrian service."
 elgar.1053.f: "After composing Linda di Chamounix for Vienna in 1842 and performing the opera there to the great enthusiasm of the audience, Donizetti accepted the post of chamber music director and court composer of Emperor Ferdinand I. In return, he was expected to be present in Vienna for about six months a year, conducting operas and concertos and composing the occasional cantata; for this he received an annual salary of 12,000 Austrian francs. Donizetti also conducted works by other composers in Vienna, such as the Vienna premieres of Rossini's Stabat mater and Verdi's Nabucco."
 elgar.1054.t: "Is Donizetti going insane?"
 elgar.1054.d: "Donizetti's increasingly rapid mental decline led to him being committed to an insane asylum in Paris."
 elgar.1054.f: "Donizetti reported in his letters over a long period of time, starting in the 1820s, about headaches, sometimes fever attacks that lasted only one day and also about occasional depressive moods. The extraordinary amount of work that he accomplished throughout his life, as well as the long journeys that were particularly strenuous at the time, especially after he moved to Paris and later to Vienna, led to increased symptoms of exhaustion from 1842–43. The occasional headache and fever attacks were accompanied by dizziness and sometimes 'sensations in the head'. In 1845 Donizetti's health deteriorated rapidly and he collapsed on the street in Paris. The doctors forbade him to compose - which depressed him even more. Finally, under false pretenses, he was lured into the insane asylum at Ivry-sur-Seine without his knowledge and against his will, and was forcibly interned there. The ailing composer quickly saw through his predicament as a 'prisoner' and classification as a 'maniac' and wrote desperate and heartbreaking letters to friends and relatives asking for help."

 elgar.1054.h: "Get him out of the insane asylum and give him rest in Bergamo."

 elgar.1055.d: "The composer has recovered after an intensive cure and wants to compose with renewed zest for life."
 elgar.1055.f: "Under pressure from our government, Donizetti was quickly expelled from the insane asylum. On doctor's orders, he was to experience a several-month cure in his hometown of Bergamo under the best possible circumstances. The return to country life, freedom from stress and pressure, and returning to his roots has borne fruit after many months. Donizetti, apathetic for weeks, responded to one of his own arias, sung by Giovanna, daughter of Baroness Rosa Rota-Basoni. Talking to family members in the local dialect also showed progress day by day. After years of therapy, the once terminally ill composer seems to have been brought back to life."

 elgar.1062.f: "Don Pasquale is an opera buffa in three acts. The opera is one of the most famous of its genre and, along with L'elisir d'amore and Lucia di Lammermoor, is one of the few works by Donizetti that has had an almost continuous performance tradition since the 19th century. Based on the comedies of Carlo Goldoni, the characters are more or less closely based on types of the commedia dell'arte, but are given sentimental traits, i. H. through the ability to feel and express sadness, pain or remorse, a differentiation that goes beyond their type. Don Pasquale was an instant hit, such as only Bellini's I puritani (1835) had previously had in Paris."
 elgar.1063.t: "Dom Sébastien"
 elgar.1063.f: "Dom Sébastien is a French grand opera in five acts by Gaetano Donizetti.  It is a historic-fiction about King Sebastian of Portugal (1554–1578) and his ill-fated 1578 expedition to Morocco. At the time, Donizetti was attempting to compose an opera competitive with similar historical operas by Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy and Giacomo Meyerbeer. One critical description of the nature of Dom Sébastien is 'a funeral in five acts'. The work was received with reluctance, which Donizetti himself felt was a fiasco. Although Donizetti considered his last opera to be one of his most important works, Dom Sébastien is largely forgotten today. It was written at a time when Donizetti 'no longer had unrestricted control over his imagination', so the opera was already marked by Donizetti's incipient illness."

 elgar.1101.d: "To mark the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution, Hector Berlioz composed a piece that attracted great public admiration."
 elgar.1101.f: "The French government commissioned the symphony for the celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution which had brought Louis-Philippe I to power, for which it was erecting the July Column in the Place de la Bastille. Berlioz had little sympathy for the régime, but welcomed the opportunity to write the work because the government had offered him 10,000 francs for it. The Symphonie militaire (later renamed Symphonie funèbre et triomphale), rather than following the model Berlioz had established in Romeo and Juliet, represents a reversion to an earlier pre-Beethovenian style in the tradition of monumental French public ceremonial music. Berlioz revised the score in January 1842, adding an optional part for strings and a final chorus to a text by Antony Deschamps. Richard Wagner attended a performance of this new version at the Salle Vivienne on 1 February 1842. On 5 February, he told Robert Schumann that he found passages in the last movement of Berlioz's symphony so 'magnificent and sublime that they can never be surpassed.'"
 elgar.1111.t: "Berlioz arrives in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 elgar.1111.f: "Louis-Hector Berlioz was a French Romantic composer and conductor. His output includes orchestral works such as the Symphonie fantastique and Harold in Italy, choral pieces including the Requiem and L'Enfance du Christ, his three operas Benvenuto Cellini, Les Troyens and Béatrice et Bénédict, and works of hybrid genres such as the 'dramatic symphony' Roméo et Juliette and the 'dramatic legend' La Damnation de Faust. Meeting only occasional success in France as a composer, Berlioz increasingly turned to conducting, in which he gained an international reputation. He was highly regarded in Germany, Britain and Russia both as a composer and as a conductor. To supplement his earnings he wrote musical journalism throughout much of his career; some of it has been preserved in book form, including his Treatise on Instrumentation, which was influential in the 19th and 20th centuries."

Macdonald suggests that Berlioz may have sought distraction from his grief by going ahead with a planned series of concerts in St Petersburg and Moscow, but far from rejuvenating him, the trip sapped his remaining strength.  He went to Nice to recuperate in the Mediterranean climate, but fell on rocks by the shore, possibly because of a stroke, and had to return to Paris, where he convalesced for several months. In August 1868, he felt able to travel briefly to Grenoble to judge a choral festival.  After arriving back in Paris he gradually grew weaker and died at his house in the Rue de Calais on 8th March 1869, at the age of 65. He was buried in Montmartre Cemetery with his two wives, who were exhumed and re-buried next to him."

 elgar.1151.d: "After extensive concert tours abroad, the composer Hector Berlioz has returned to France."
 elgar.1151.f: "On his travels, especially in Germany, Berlioz not only noticed the higher level of musical culture, but also the greater opportunities for composers, which was due in particular to the division into small states there. The latter ensured that there were a far greater number of prestigious positions in the German music world, while France's centralization also brought with it a strong orientation towards the capital Paris. Nonetheless, Berlioz once again speculated on a lucrative post at home, although the German audience and German critics were often more favorable to him than the French representatives."
 elgar.1161.t: "Les Troyens"
 elgar.1161.f: "Les Troyens is a French grand opera in five acts by Hector Berlioz. The libretto was written by Berlioz himself from Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid; the score was composed between 1856 and 1858. Les Troyens is Berlioz's most ambitious work, the summation of his entire artistic career, but he did not live to see it performed in its entirety. Under the title Les Troyens à Carthage, the last three acts were premièred with many cuts by Léon Carvalho's company, the Théâtre Lyrique, at their theatre (now the Théâtre de la Ville) on the Place du Châtelet in Paris on 4 November 1863, with 21 repeat performances. After decades of neglect, today the opera is considered by some music critics as one of the finest ever written."
 elgar.1162.t: "La damnation de Faust"
 elgar.1162.f: "La damnation de Faust is a work for four solo voices, full seven-part chorus, large children's chorus and orchestra by the French composer Hector Berlioz. He called it a "légende dramatique" (dramatic legend). The French composer was inspired by a translation of Goethe's dramatic poem Faust and produced a musical work that, like the masterpiece on which it is based, defies easy categorisation. Conceived at various times as a free-form oratorio and as an opera its travelogue form and cosmic perspective have made it an extreme challenge to stage as an opera. Berlioz himself was eager to see the work staged, but once he did, he conceded that the production techniques of his time were not up to the task of bringing the work to dramatic life. Most of the work's fame has come through concert performances."
 elgar.1163.t: "Treatise on Instrumentation"
 elgar.1163.f: "'This Traité d'Instrumentation is a highly paradoxical work. It begins with a preface of several lines unrelated to the subject, in which the author takes a stand against musicians who abuse modulations and whose penchant for dissonance matches the taste that certain animals have for salty plants and thorny bushes. Then he turns to the orchestral instruments and mixes strange assertions with the most solid truths and valuable advice.[...] In his treatise, as in his orchestration, Berlioz, for all its oddities, is simply fabulous. To him my generation owes its education, and I dare say a good one. Berlioz possessed the invaluable gift of igniting the imagination and arousing love for the art he taught.[...] These seemingly superfluous musical examples made one dream, they opened the door to a new world, to a vast one and fascinating glimpse of the future, of the Promised Land.' - Camille Saint-Saëns"

 elgar.1201.f: "In the winter of 1835/36 Sigismund Thalberg made his debut in a private concert given by the secretary of the Austrian embassy in Paris. He was greeted enthusiastically by the artists present, including Rossini and Meyerbeer, and praised as the inventor of a new style of piano. While Franz Liszt's concerts in Lyon brought in around 500-600 francs, Thalberg earned 10,000 francs from a single concert at the Italian Theater. Before Thalberg appeared on his second stay in Paris, Liszt published a review riddled with insinuations and polemics. According to Liszt, Thalberg's success came about solely through propaganda. Thalberg appeared again in Paris from February 1837 and was celebrated again. On March 31, both artists performed at a charity event organized by Princess Belgiojoso."

 elgar.1211.f: "Franz Liszt was an Austro-Hungarian composer, pianist, conductor, theater director, music teacher. Liszt was one of the most prominent and influential piano virtuosos and, with an oeuvre of over 1300 works and arrangements, one of the most productive composers of the 19th century. Although a large part of his oeuvre can be assigned to the piano literature, Liszt also gave a clear impetus to orchestral music with the development of the symphonic poem. His concept of program music and the use of new harmonic and formal means made him - along with Richard Wagner - the best-known protagonist of the New German School. Liszt began an extensive tour of Europe in 1839, which he continued for the next eight years. This period was Liszt's most brilliant as a concert pianist and he received many honors and much adulation during his tours. During this period, the first reports of intense responses from Liszt's fans appeared, which became referred to as Lisztomania. Lisztomania was characterized by a hysterical reaction to Liszt and his concerts. Liszt's playing was reported to raise the mood of the audience to a level of mystical ecstasy."

In Rome, where he mostly stayed until 1870, he led a part mundane, part monastic life and withdrew to a monastery in the summer of 1863, where Pope Pius IX also visited him. In 1865 Liszt underwent tonsure and received the four minor orders. From then on, as a cleric, he wore the Roman collar and was addressed as an abbe. In 1886 Liszt attended the Wagner Festival. At the time of the trip, Liszt was already seriously ill and died a few days after his arrival on July 31, 1886 as a result of pneumonia. Bernhard Schnappauf, doctor and friend of Richard Wagner, spent the last few days on his deathbed and reported that Liszt died quietly and with dignity. He closed his eyes and made the death mask, for which, according to the old custom, he was entitled to the shroud and pillowcase."

 elgar.1251.d: "After many years of concert tours, the piano virtuoso and composer Franz Liszt is considering settling in Weimar."
 elgar.1251.f: "The Weimar years were Franz Liszt's most artistically productive period. He wrote many of his piano works in Weimar, such as the Piano Sonata in B minor, the Harmonies poétiques et religieuses cycle, fifteen Hungarian Rhapsodies, as well as numerous transcriptions, piano reductions and revisions of earlier piano works, such as the Paganini Etudes. Two of his previously conceived piano concertos also received their final form here. In Weimar, Liszt conducted many works by contemporary composers, some of whom were controversial at the time, and also performed their operas. He conducted works by Richard Wagner, who was particularly close to him and whom he helped to flee to Zurich in the spring of 1849 after the Dresden uprising. In the years that followed, he supported Wagner financially as well as morally and maintained a lively correspondence with him. Later, Liszt and Wagner often appeared together as conductors. From 1865, after Wagner had a relationship with Liszt's daughter Cosima, the relationship cooled off for a long time."

 elgar.1252.f: "In the late years of his life, Liszt increasingly turned to sacred music and church music. His last tone poem, 'From the cradle to the grave' therefore differed from all his predecessors. Liszt was inspired by a drawing by the Hungarian painter Mihály Zichy. Large sections of the work do not require a powerful orchestra, especially the beginning sounds like chamber music; many islands of sound are formed in which the musical material is poor, and solo passages are not uncommon, especially at the end of the movements. The harmonics used are also a harbinger of times to come. During his lifetime, however, music critics rated the work as the 'mistake of an old man'."

 elgar.1261.t: "Les Préludes"
 elgar.1261.f: "Les Préludes is the third of Franz Liszt's thirteen symphonic poems. The music was composed between 1845-54, and began as an overture to Liszt's choral cycle Les quatre élémens (The Four Elements), then revised as a stand-alone concert overture, with a new title referring to a poem by Alphonse de Lamartine. Les préludes is the earliest example of an orchestral work entitled 'Symphonic Poem'. Liszt sees the phases of life as preludes to the melody of death. These phases of life are struggles and storms, love happiness and pain, consolation, experiencing nature. Despite the contrasts in these moods reflected in Les Préludes, the work is of great coherence. It begins with a melancholy melody, from which the first stormy main theme develops, which leads to the second theme via a pastoral part. These two themes are developed in glidingly changing moods. In a climax, the original theme flows into the first main theme as a majestic, glamorous fanfare."
 elgar.1262.t: "Hungarian Rhapsodies"
 elgar.1262.f: "The Hungarian Rhapsodies is a set of 19 piano pieces based on Hungarian folk themes, composed by Franz Liszt during 1846-1853, and later in 1882 and 1885. Liszt also arranged versions for orchestra, piano duet and piano trio. Some are better known than others, with Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 being particularly famous and No. 6, No. 10, No. 12 and No. 14 (especially as arranged for piano and orchestra as the Hungarian Fantasy) also being well known. Liszt incorporated many themes he had heard in his native western Hungary and which he believed to be folk music, though many were in fact tunes written by members of the Hungarian upper middle class, or by composers such as József Kossovits. In their original piano form, the Hungarian Rhapsodies are noted for their difficulty."
 elgar.1263.t: "Dante Symphony"
 elgar.1263.f: "The 'Dante Symphony' is a choral symphony composed by Franz Liszt. Written in the high romantic style, it is based on Dante Alighieri's journey through Hell and Purgatory, as depicted in The Divine Comedy. Some critics have argued that the Dante Symphony is not so much a symphony in the classical sense as it is two descriptive symphonic poems. Liszt's original intention was to compose the work in three movements: an Inferno, a Purgatorio and a Paradiso. The first two were to be purely instrumental, and the finale choral. Wagner, however, persuaded Liszt that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral Magnificat at the end of the second movement. Liszt scholar Humphrey Searle argues that while Liszt may have felt more at home portraying the infernal regions than the celestial ones, the task of portraying Paradise in music would not have been beyond his powers."

The only too well-founded anxiety as to their success has so dominated my feelings at all subsequent first performances of my works that I could never really enjoy them or take much notice of the way the audience was behaving. [...] The initial success of Rienzi was no doubt assured beforehand. But the uproarious way in which the public declared its partiality for me was extraordinary ... The public had been forcibly predisposed to accept it, because everyone connected with the theatre had been spreading such favourable reports ... that the entire population was looking forward to what was heralded as a miracle ... In trying to recall my condition that evening, I can remember it only as possessing all the features of a dream.' - Richard Wagner"
 elgar.1311.t: "Wagner arrives in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 elgar.1311.f: "With his through-composed music dramas, Wilhelm Richard Wagner is considered one of the most important composers of the Romantic era. He used characteristic leitmotifs for figures, events and feelings and developed the technique in the 'Ring des Nibelungen' into a systematic method. The 'Gesamtkunstwerk' he propagated combines different arts such as music, poetry and drama into one unit. Wagner's innovations in harmony influenced the development of music up to the present day. Wagner dealt intensively with material from Germanic mythology and legends such as the swan knight, the Nibelungen saga and the Holy Grail as part of the Arthurian legend. In Lohengrin, the Ring tetralogy and the late work Parsifal, his thoughts revolve around the motif of redemption. With Tristan und Isolde he created one of the most famous love operas in music history. Richard Wagner founded the Bayreuth Festival, which was exclusively dedicated to the performance of his own works. Wagner's impact goes far beyond the musical realm. Writers and painters, philosophers and sculptors have dealt with him as well as Germanists, historians, political and religious scientists."

On February 13, 1883, he stayed in the side wing of the Palazzo Vendramin-Calergi that he and his family lived in. Around 3 p.m., the family waited at the table for Wagner, who, despite having a heart attack, was in his study writing an essay on the feminine in the human. The maid found him slumped at his desk over the words 'Nevertheless, the process of woman's emancipation proceeds only with ecstatic convulsions. Love - Tragedy'.

 elgar.1351.f: "Lohengrin is a romantic opera in three acts by the German composer Richard Wagner. With Lohengrin, Wagner created the new operatic form of through-composed musical drama. The composition is not divided into individual numbers, but is played through act by act without interruption. Wagner thus sets himself apart from the conventional structure of number operas with arias, recitatives and choral parts. In order to be able to translate the inner life of the stage characters into clearly legible musical motifs, Wagner used leitmotifs (e.g. the Grail motif and the question ban motif). The opera has inspired other works of art. King Ludwig II of Bavaria named his castle Neuschwanstein Castle after the Swan Knight."

 elgar.1352.f: "The 'Artwork of the Future' is an art-theoretical writings by Richard Wagner that he wrote between 1849 and 1852 in Zurich. As in his writing 'Art and the Revolution', Wagner laments the decay of the arts and develops his model of the new unity of the arts, the 'Gesamtkunstwerk'. As in his previous writings, Wagner developed his conviction that Greek art was embedded in Greek religion and mysticism and that, through the destruction of religion, art was also loosing its cohesion and becoming 'individual arts' (drama, music and dance) had to degenerate. He complains that the art of music as a pure accompaniment to the word has withered away. In the further course of hisexplanations he goes into great detail on the development of the different arts, from the ideal state during antiquity to the decadence of his time. In his next and most important written work, Opera and Drama, Richard Wagner then explains very precisely (and very theoretically) how he imagines the optimal 'union' of music and poetry. A little later he set to work on the 'practical' execution and wrote and composed his 'Ring des Nibelungen' as the music drama par excellence after years of work."

 elgar.1353.d: "Tristan und Isolde is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner to a German libretto by the composer, based largely on the 12th-century romance Tristan and Iseult by Gottfried von Strassburg. The opera was enormously influential among Western classical composers and provided direct inspiration to composers such as Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and Benjamin Britten. Other composers like Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky formulated their styles in contrast to Wagner's musical legacy. Many see Tristan as a milestone on the move away from common practice harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century."
 elgar.1353.f: "'The work that has always aroused my greatest admiration is Tristan. A shuddering astonishment seizes me in front of this gigantic building, and it still seems incredible to me how a human being could conceive and realize it.

Wagner himself conceived and promoted the idea of a special festival to showcase his own works, in particular his monumental cycle 'Der Ring des Nibelungen' and 'Parsifal'. Performances take place in a specially designed theatre, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. Wagner personally supervised the design and construction of the theatre, which contained many architectural innovations to accommodate the huge orchestras for which Wagner wrote as well as the composer's particular vision about the staging of his works. The Festival has become a pilgrimage destination for Wagnerians and classical-music enthusiasts. Present at this unique musical event were Kaiser Wilhelm, Dom Pedro II of Brazil, King Ludwig, and other members of the nobility, as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and such accomplished composers as Anton Bruckner, Edvard Grieg, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Franz Liszt, and the young Arthur Foote."

 elgar.1356.t: "Richard Wagner - a politician?"
 elgar.1356.d: "Richard Wagner is a composer with a wide following and has been known for his polemics for years. It seems he now wants to convert this into political capital."
 elgar.1356.f: "Richard Wagner was a political person throughout his life, strongly influenced by materialistic and sometimes radical socialist ideas, before he later came under the influence of Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophical work. Nevertheless, his works also remained strongly influenced by the idea of an establishment whose power had to be broken. He was actively involved in the 1848 revolution in Saxony and therefore later had to flee. In his essay 'Die Wiebelungen' he foresaw a special role in history for the Germans and saw them on the one hand as Trojans and on the other hand as the only ones capable of saving mankind. Throughout his life, Wagner was an anti-Semite, an attitude that grew stronger over the years and found its most intense expression in the pamphlet 'Das Judenthum in der Musik'."
 elgar.1357.t: "Tannhäuser Scandal"
 elgar.1357.d: "A performance of Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser caused a real scandal that outraged all of Parisian society. In addition to Wagner's breach of the good rules of French opera life, animosity between the German and French musical worlds also played a role."
 elgar.1357.f: "Wagner has always had a difficult time in Paris, not only because of his competition with the popular Giacomo Meyerbeer. In order to accommodate his opera Tannhäuser at the Grand Opera, he had to bow to French customs - such as the installation of a ballet. But Wagner vehemently resisted the specifications and only included a bacchanal. At the same time, Wagner made himself unpopular with the musicians with agonizingly long rehearsals. The premiere caused a scandal: the gentlemen of the Paris 'Jockey Club' felt betrayed when the ballet didn't appear after the overture. The gentlemen didn't come because of the music, but to watch the beautiful women and to visit them later in the changing room. Since they don't bid what they get, they sabotage the event with whistles and shouts. The next day is no better: the Parisian press tears the performance up in the air. Not only France, but also Wagner's friends and enemies in Germany will be watching our reaction closely."

 elgar.1361.t: "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg"
 elgar.1361.f: "'Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg' is a music drama, or opera, in three acts, by Richard Wagner. It is the longest opera commonly performed, taking nearly four and a half hours, not counting two breaks between acts, and is traditionally not cut. The Meistersinger of Nuremberg occupies a unique place in Wagner's oeuvre. It is the only comedy among his mature operas and is also unusual among his works in being set in a historically well-defined time and place rather than in a mythical or legendary setting. It is the only mature Wagner opera based on an entirely original story. It incorporates many of the operatic conventions that Wagner had railed against in his essays on the theory of opera: rhymed verse, arias, choruses, a quintet, and even a ballet."
 elgar.1362.t: "Die Walküre"
 elgar.1362.f: "'Die Walküre' forms together with the operas 'Das Rheingold', 'Siegfried' and 'Götterdämmerung' the complete work 'Der Ring des Nibelungen'. Wagner largely followed the principles related to the form of musical drama, reflecting the feelings and moods behind the work, using a system of recurring leitmotifs to represent people, ideas, and situations rather than the conventional operatic units of arias, ensembles, and choruses. The story of Die Walküre is based on the Norse mythology told in the Völsunga saga and the Poetic Edda."
 elgar.1363.t: "Parsifal"
 elgar.1363.f: "Richard Wagner's Parsifal contains religious elements such as sacred music, the unveiling of the monstrance (Grail), baptism and the Christian communion ritual. Already in his Zurich art writings, he developed the idea of ​​using art to clarify the core of religion. Wagner explained that in order to transform his parable-like message of salvation and regeneration of mankind through compassion - represented by the searching Parsifal and the suffering Amfortas - he chose an art form which, with religious symbolism, was intended to have a 'rapturing effect on the mind'. Wagner himself described the three-act play as a stage consecration festival play and decreed that it should only be performed in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus."

 elgar.1401.d: "A young 19-year-old student of the Leipzig Conservatory made his debut as a pianist in Kralshamn today. He comes from Norway, his name is Edvard Grieg."
 elgar.1401.f: "Edvard Grieg's career originally began as a pianist. Even before completing his studies at the Leipzig Conservatory, 19-year-old Grieg made his debut in Karlshamn, Sweden, before returning to his native Norway a few years later. Grieg had been a student of Ignaz Moscheles in Leipzig, but otherwise he had found the conservative climate in Leipzig very unappealing."
 elgar.1411.t: "Grieg arrives in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 elgar.1411.f: "Edvard Hagerup Grieg is widely considered one of the foremost Romantic era composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide. His use of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions brought the music of Norway to fame, as well as helping to develop a national identity, much as Jean Sibelius did in Finland and Bedřich Smetana in Bohemia. As a pianist and conductor he undertook numerous concert tours in Europe. Similar to the mighty heap in Russia with Mussorgsky at the helm, Grieg fused elements of the folk music of his homeland - such as empty fifths, sharply emphasized dance rhythms, the vacillation between modal and major-minor keys - with the compositional achievements of late Romanticism. Some of his harmonies already herald Impressionism and are uniquely radical in some compositions such as Klokkeklang. Among the many others who refer to Grieg in their compositional activities, either explicitly or in cryptic form in the music, are Frederick Delius, Maurice Ravel, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Dmitri Shostakovich and Béla Bartók."

His last words were 'Well, if it must be so.' The funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people to the streets of his home town to honor him. Obeying his wish, his own Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak was played with orchestration by his friend Johan Halvorsen, who had married Grieg's niece. In addition, the Funeral March movement from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played. Grieg was cremated in the first Norwegian crematorium opened in Bergen just that year, and his ashes were entombed in a mountain crypt near his house, Troldhaugen. After the death of his wife, her ashes were placed alongside his.'"

 elgar.1451.t: "Holberg Suite"
 elgar.1451.d: "Edvard Grieg's Holberg Suite, which premiered in Oslo, has not only turned out to be a musical masterpiece, but has also inspired Norwegian national sentiment."
 elgar.1451.f: "The Holberg Suite, subtitled 'Suite in olden style', is a suite of five movements based on eighteenth-century dance forms, written by Edvard Grieg in 1884 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Dano-Norwegian humanist playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754). It exemplifies nineteenth-century music which makes use of musical styles and forms from the preceding century. The Holberg Suite was originally composed for the piano, but a year later was adapted by Grieg himself for string orchestra. The suite consists of an introduction and a set of dances. It is an early essay in neoclassicism, an attempt to echo as much as was known in Grieg's time of the music of Holberg's era. Although not as famous as Grieg's incidental music from Peer Gynt, which is itself usually performed as arranged in a pair of suites, many critics regard the works as of equal merit."
 elgar.1452.t: "Piano Concerto in A minor"
 elgar.1452.d: "A piano concerto by Edvard Grieg celebrated its world premiere today in Copenhagen. It is already foreseeable that this will be one of his most popular pieces."
 elgar.1452.f: "The Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 16, composed by Edvard Grieg in 1868, was the only concerto Grieg completed. The work is among Grieg's earliest important works, written by the 24-year-old composer in 1868 in Søllerød, Denmark, during one of his visits there to benefit from the climate. Grieg's concerto provides evidence of his interest in Norwegian folk music; the opening flourish is based on the motif of a falling minor second followed by a falling major third, which is typical of the folk music of Grieg's native country. The work was premiered by Edmund Neupert on 3 April 1869, in Copenhagen, with Holger Simon Paulli conducting. Some sources say that Grieg himself, an excellent pianist, was the intended soloist, but he was unable to attend the premiere owing to commitments with an orchestra in Christiania (now Oslo). Among those who did attend the premiere were the Danish composer Niels Gade and the Russian pianist Anton Rubinstein, who provided his piano for the occasion. Grieg revised the work at least seven times, usually in subtle ways, but the revisions amounted to over 300 differences from the original orchestration."
 elgar.1461.t: "Peer Gynt"
 elgar.1461.f: "Peer Gynt, Op. 23, is the incidental music to Henrik Ibsen's 1867 play of the same name, written by the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. Although composing many short piano pieces and chamber works, the work Grieg did for Henrik Ibsen stood out. Originally composing 90 minutes of orchestral music for the play, he later went back and extracted certain sections for the suites. Peer Gynt's travels around the world and distant lands are represented by the instruments Grieg chooses to use. Grieg later created two suites from his Peer Gynt music. Some of the music from these suites has received coverage in popular culture, especially the pieces 'Morning Mood', 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' and 'Solveig's Song'."
 elgar.1462.t: "Lyric Pieces"
 elgar.1462.f: "Lyric Pieces is a collection of 66 short pieces for solo piano written by Edvard Grieg. They were published in 10 volumes, from 1867 to 1901. The collection includes several of his best known pieces, such as Wedding Day at Troldhaugen, To Spring, March of the Trolls, and Butterfly. The theme of the first piece in the set, Arietta, was one of the composer's favorite melodies. In the words of pianist Andrei Gavrilow, the Lyric Pieces are 'a very special kind of diary that Grieg kept throughout his life, or a confession, because they reflect the most intimate moments in the composer's life'."
 elgar.1463.t: "Norwegian Dances"
 elgar.1463.f: "The Norwegian Dances were the Norwegian's answer to the hugely successful Slavonic Dances of Antonín Dvořák and the Hungarian Dances of Johannes Brahms. The two colleagues had published their dance series for piano four hands in 1878 and 1881 by the Simrock publishing house. At that time Grieg did not dare to orchestrate his dances, since the terrain was occupied by his friend Johan Svendsen's 'Norwegian Rhapsodies'. The orchestral version of his Norwegian Dances was therefore arranged by Robert Henriques - much to Grieg's satisfaction. For the first dance, Grieg used the popular Sinklar march, for the last three so-called "Hallings", traditional Norwegian bridal dances for young men, which are fast and very acrobatic to perform."

His name is Johannes Brahms, he came from Hamburg, worked there in a dark silence, but was trained by an excellent and enthusiastic teacher in difficult settings of art, recommended to me shortly before by a revered, well-known master. On the outside, too, he wore all the signs that announce to us: He is a called man.' - Robert Schumann"

 elgar.1511.t: "Brahms arrives in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 elgar.1511.f: "Johannes Brahms was a German composer, pianist and conductor. His compositions are predominantly assigned to the High Romantic era; however, by incorporating baroque and classical forms, they go beyond them. Brahms is considered one of the most important composers of the 19th century; some even rank him with Bach and Beethoven. Brahms has been considered both a traditionalist and an innovator, by his contemporaries and by later writers. His music is rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Classical masters. Embedded within those structures are deeply romantic motifs. His contribution and craftsmanship were admired by subsequent figures as diverse as Arnold Schoenberg and Edward Elgar. The detailed construction of Brahms's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers. In the so-called music dispute, Brahms was one of the opponents of the New German School, which propagated the program music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner as musical progress. Brahms preferred music that, by virtue of its specific quality, is immune to historical change."

His last public appearance was on March 7, 1897 when he saw Hans Richter conduct his Symphony No. 4; there was an ovation after each of the four movements. After being laid out in the mourning house, where Carl Kundmann removed his death mask and Ludwig Michalek made a last pastel picture, the consecration took place on April 6 in the Lutheran City Church."

 elgar.1551.f: "The Variations on a Theme by Haydn op. 56a is a variation work for orchestra by Johannes Brahms. The work was created in the summer of 1873 in Tutzing. The premiere took place on November 2, 1873 in Vienna under Brahms' direction. The piece falls into an epoch in which Brahms wanted to celebrate his stay in Vienna. On the one hand he left Detmold and Hamburg disappointed years ago. On the other hand, he strived to live where his great classical role models had lived and to continue the Viennese tradition."

 elgar.1552.d: "After 14 years of work, Johannes Brahms has presented his 1st symphony, which was premiered in Karlsruhe."
 elgar.1552.f: "'Johannes recently sent me - think what a surprise - a 1st symphony movement with the following bold beginning. This is probably a bit strong, but I got used to it very quickly. The movement is full of wonderful beauties, with a mastery of motifs that is becoming more and more his own. Everything is so interestingly intertwined, yet as energetic as a first outpouring; one really enjoys it to the full without being reminded of the work. The transition from the second part back to the first has once again been wonderfully successful.' - Clara Schuman"

 elgar.1553.d: "Johannes Brahms's 'Song of the Fates' was premiered in Basel. Along with Vienna, Switzerland was one of Brahms' most important places to stay."
 elgar.1553.f: "The Gesang der Parzen (Song of the Fates) is the last composition for choir and orchestra by Johannes Brahms. More than 10 years after the cantata Rinaldo op. 50 and the alto rhapsody op. 51, Brahms again used a text by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. According to Max Kalbeck, Brahms was inspired to compose by the actress Charlotte Wolter, who appeared in the role of Iphigenia at the Burgtheater in Vienna. On June 13, 1896, Brahms wrote about the piece: 'I often hear philosophizing about the sixth verse of the Parzenlied. I think the heart of the unsuspecting listener should grow soft and the eye wet at the mere entrance of the major; only then does the misery of mankind seize him.'"

The deep seriousness, combined with all the magic of poetry, has a wonderful, shocking and soothing effect. As you know, I can never really put it into words, but I feel the whole rich treasure of this work to the core, and the enthusiasm that speaks from every piece moves me deeply, which is why I can't help myself pronounce … Oh, if I could hear it, what would I give for it.' - Clara Schuman"

 elgar.1562.f: "The Hungarian Dances by Johannes Brahms are a set of 21 lively dance tunes based mostly on Hungarian themes, completed in 1879. They vary from about a minute to five minutes in length. They are among Brahms's most popular works and were the most profitable for him. Each dance has been arranged for a wide variety of instruments and ensembles. Brahms originally wrote the version for piano four hands and later arranged the first ten dances for solo piano. The violinist Joseph Joachim, who was a friend of Brahms, created a virtuoso arrangement of all Hungarian Dances for violin and piano."
 elgar.1563.t: "Symphony No. 4"
 elgar.1563.f: "Symphony No. 4 is the last symphony written by Johannes Brahms. Today it is one of the composer's most popular and most frequently performed orchestral works. At first glance, the uncompromising way in which the work is designed was disconcerting. When Brahms and Ignaz Brüll played the symphony to friends on two pianos, Clara Schumann and Brahms' later biographer Max Kalbeck, among others, reacted with rejection. Eduard Hanslick is said to have exclaimed: 'Throughout the movement I felt as if I were being beaten through by two terribly clever people.' Elisabeth von Herzogenberg described the work as 'a small world for the clever and knowledgeable, in which the people who walk in the dark could only have a small part'. When Brahms attended a performance of the symphony in 1897, shortly before his death, he received thunderous applause from the Viennese audience, which the work has received to this day."

The father wanted his son to be the successor in the company, but the son paid little attention to business in Europe and was more interested in art and music. Therefore, Delius jr. transferred to an orange plantation in Florida to keep him away from the influences of the European metropolises. However, it was this transfer that was to be of outstanding importance for his later musical creativity. In Jacksonville, Delius met the Catholic organist Thomas Ward, who Delius says was the only one who actually taught him anything. A little later Delius was to publish his first compositions in Danville, Virginia."

Delius came from an old family of textile traders and manufacturers of German origin, but found it difficult to follow in the footsteps of his father Julius and neglected the business. Julius therefore transferred Frederick to an orange plantation in Florida in order to keep him away from the influences of the European metropolises. But it was precisely in the American south that Delius got to know his music teacher Thomas Ward and the Afro-American music culture as an inspiration. Finally, in 1886, his father granted him an eighteen-month course, where Edvard Grieg recognized his talent and became his mentor. His first important pieces were created during his time in Leipzig, including dedications to Grieg's wife Nina. He developed his very personal style, which was initially influenced by Wagner and Grieg, and later also by Debussy: unmistakable harmony, a seemingly endless flow of music and a sensitive grasp of the finest emotional nuances that is close to impressionism. Delius' music can be understood as an important musical expression of the 'Fin de siècle'."

He took treatment at clinics across Europe, but by 1922 he was walking with two sticks, and by 1928 he was paralysed and blind. There was no return to the prosperity of pre-war years: Delius's medical treatment was an additional expense, his blindness prevented him from composing. A young English admirer, Eric Fenby, learning that Delius was trying to compose by dictating to Jelka, volunteered his services as an unpaid amanuensis. For five years, from 1928, he worked with Delius, taking down his new compositions from dictation, and helping him revise earlier works. Delius died at Grez on 10 June 1934, aged 72. He had wished to be buried in his own garden, but the French authorities forbade it.

The place was then known as an artists' colony, where Scandinavian painters like Carl Larsson and members of the Skagen Painters or Glasgow boys had settled. Around the turn of the century he created his first mature masterpieces, such as Paris, A Village Romeo and Juliet and Appalachia."

Delius now turned to the conventional forms of absolute music, but failed to structure the opulence of his tonal language in a convincing manner."
 elgar.1661.t: "Koanga"
 elgar.1661.f: "'Koanga is one of those singular works that attract attention in Delius's development, but which stand apart from the rest of his music. Usually, once a work was written, Delius's interest in it would wane. It would then be renewed and be relived temporarily every time he heard it again. For Koanga, however, he showed concern as though it held some secret bond that bound him to his youth in Florida. It was the one work he deplored in old age he was never likely to hear again. And so it proved. A dark grandeur pervades the score which, whilst yielding to hankerings after Wagner, recalls the tragic gusto of Verdi. The elements of time, place and plot allowed him a range of textures and moods wider than in his other operas.' - Eric Fenby"

Together with Summer Night on the River it is one of Delius's Two Pieces for Small Orchestra. The two were first performed in Leipzig on 23 October 1913, conducted by Arthur Nikisch. The main theme, marked 'With easy flowing movement', is an exchange of cuckoo calls. The second theme is scored for first violins, and is taken from a Norwegian folksong, 'In Ola Valley', which was brought to Delius's attention by the composer and folksong arranger Percy Grainger.

He was not only one of the most important composers of the late Romantic period, but also one of the most famous conductors of his time and, as opera director, one of the most important reformers of music theater. His work at the Vienna Court Opera is considered epochal. Stefan Zweig, for example, wrote in his memoirs about Mahler's fame in Vienna: 'To have seen Gustav Mahler on the street was an event that one proudly reported to one's comrades the next morning, like a personal triumph'. Compared to the standards of the time, Mahler's musical and scenic interpretations were characterized by their high fidelity to the original. His role model had a direct influence on a younger generation of conductors. His rank as a composer, on the other hand, was disputed until well after his death. Although a community of enthusiastic followers quickly formed, his creations initially met with a lack of interest, incomprehension or rejection from the music-interested public. It was not until the 1960s that his work was finally able to establish itself as part of the so-called 'Mahler Renaissance'."

A woman comes by and says to another: 'Now he's in peace inside. Everything was too small for him.' The church in Grinzing is small, the churchyard narrow. And a spectacle for the Viennese is imminent. The church and cemetery will be cordoned off. Only cards will give access. We learn that Franz Schalk, Gregor, and the board of directors have requested that the opera be closed on the day of the funeral. No word on that. The court, the municipality of Vienna, does not move. And then the celebration. (Because she was). We are standing in front of the church when the coffin is carried out. It's raining. We get to the grave more quickly via a vineyard path. The train arrives. The rain stops. A nightingale sings, the clods fall. A rainbow. And the hundreds are silent.' - Paul Stefan"

 elgar.1751.t: "The new Kapellmeister of the Vienna State Opera"
 elgar.1751.d: "From 1897 to 1907 Mahler held the outstanding position in Europe of first conductor and director of the Vienna Opera House."
 elgar.1751.f: "'When an amazing exceptional case happened and Gustav Mahler was appointed director of the Court Opera at the age of thirty-eight, a shocked murmur and amazement went through the whole of Vienna that such a young person had been entrusted with the first art institute. [...] This distrust that every young person was 'not entirely reliable' ran through all circles at the time.' - Stefan Zweig"
 elgar.1751.g: "He's welcome to give concerts, but he's definitely too young to hold such an important position!"
 elgar.1751.h: "He's just the right man. Hire him."
 elgar.1752.t: "An Austrian in New York"
 elgar.1752.d: "After disputes in his Austrian homeland, Gustav Mahler found an audience in New York, with whom his works were very well received. Some of those responsible in the US music world would like to engage him on a long-term basis."
 elgar.1752.f: "For some, the German doublet was too tight when they heard the name Mahler. Some out of excitement, but most out of anger. It has been like this from day one. He had an immediate effect, inciting, provocative, alarming - it doesn't matter: he belongs to the electric and electrifying natures that give off sparks or ignite at the slightest touch. In the beginning, of course, only his frenetic unpopularity made him popular. Carried by the favor of hate, carefully illuminated by envy, that eternally sleepless and powerful protector of all that is real, by ridicule, by envy and slander, proclaimed by the loudest sound carriers on every street corner, he has become famous. […] And so it was heard every day that he mistreats his musicians, whips them into inhuman work, almost incites them to death, and that if they were only able, they would all like to drown him in a spoonful of water. It was said that he shortened his singers, drilled them like recruits, played with them like the Great Turk with his slaves. […] The intensity of his being seemed to fill the whole city of New York. - Felix Salten"
 elgar.1752.g: "What a strange guy."
 elgar.1752.h: "Mahler should stay in America."
 elgar.1761.t: "Symphony No. 5"
 elgar.1761.f: "Like some of Mahler's other symphonies, the 5th symphony was not understood after its premiere. In 1905, after an unsuccessful performance in Hamburg, Mahler complained: 'The Fifth is a cursed work. Nobody gets it.' Music reviews in the years following the premiere were mostly negative. The music critic Ferdinand Pfohl, for example, judged that the 5th symphony was one of Mahler's weaker works. Only the Neue Zeitung für Musik gave the symphony a benevolent testimony and spoke of an 'overwhelming wealth of beauty'. Especially in comparison to the 4th symphony written two years earlier, it represents a major difference in content and form. With the rougher sound world of the 5th symphony, Mahler begins a new creative phase, which is further developed in the following 6th symphony. Only after Mahler's death did the work become more and more appreciated."
 elgar.1762.t: "Lied von der Erde"
 elgar.1762.f: "'Is it really the same man who, 'in harmony with the infinite', erected the edifice of the Eighth that we now find in the drinking song of Earth's woes? Who creeps lonely in the autumn to his beloved resting place, longing for refreshment? Who looks at youth with a friendly look of old age, with gentle emotion at beauty? Who seeks to forget the meaningless earthly existence in drunkenness and finally says goodbye in melancholy? […] It is hardly the same person and composer. All works up to that point had arisen from the feeling of life [...] The earth is disappearing, a different air is blowing in, a different light shines over it. [...] When I brought the autograph back to him, almost unable to say a word about it, he opened the 'Abschied' and said, 'What do you think? Is that bearable at all? Won't people kill themselves afterwards?' He then pointed to the rhythmic difficulties and asked jokingly, 'Any idea how to conduct that? Not me!' - Bruno Walter"
 elgar.1763.t: "Kindertotenlieder"
 elgar.1763.f: "'I can well understand that one composes such terrible lyrics when one has no children or when one has lost children. But I can't understand how you can sing about the death of children if you hugged and kissed them half an hour before, happy and healthy!' - Alma Mahler-Werfel, wife of Gustav Mahler"

 elgar.1801.t: "Piano Concerto No. 2"
 elgar.1801.d: "After many setbacks, the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff has made an impressive return: his Second Piano Concerto caused frenetic applause."
 elgar.1801.f: "After the disastrous 1897 premiere of his First Symphony, Rachmaninoff suffered a psychological breakdown that prevented composition for three years. Although depression sapped his energy, he still engaged in performance. Conducting and piano lessons became necessary to ease his financial position. In 1899, he was supposed to perform the Second Piano Concerto in London, which he had not composed yet due to illness, and instead made a successful conducting debut. Relatives decided to introduce him to the neurologist Nikolai Dahl, whom he visited daily from January to April 1900, which helped restore his health and confidence in composition. Rachmaninoff dedicated the concerto to Dahl for successfully treating him. After he fulfilled his 1908 London concert engagement at the Queen's Hall under Serge Koussevitzky  a flattering review by The Times emerged: 'The direct expression of the work, the extraordinary precision and exactitude of Rachmaninoff's playing, and even the strict economy of movement of arms and hands which he exercises, all contributed to the impression of completeness of performance.'"
 elgar.1811.t: "Rachmaninoff arrives in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 elgar.1811.f: "Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff is widely considered one of the finest pianists of his day and, as a composer, one of the last great representatives of Romanticism in Russian classical music. Early influences of Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other Russian composers gave way to a thoroughly personal idiom notable for its song-like melodicism, expressiveness and rich orchestral colours. The piano is featured prominently in Rachmaninoff's compositional output and he made a point of using his skills as a performer to fully explore the expressive and technical possibilities of the instrument. n 1897, following the disastrous premiere of his Symphony No. 1, Rachmaninoff entered a four-year depression and composed little until successful supportive therapy allowed him to complete his enthusiastically received Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1901. In the course of the next sixteen years, Rachmaninoff conducted at the Bolshoi Theatre. Rachmaninoff was one of the last representatives of a centuries-old tradition. Up until the late 19th century (most) composers were equally important virtuosos of their time. Rachmaninoff was one of the last to exercise this dual function."

 elgar.1851.t: "Rachmaninoff in the USA"
 elgar.1851.d: "In the past, Rachmaninoff had repeatedly received offers from the USA, but rejected them. Due to a tense financial situation, however, he currently sees moving to the USA as advantageous."
 elgar.1851.f: "During the Scandinavian tour, Rachmaninoff received three offers from the US: to become the conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra for two years, to conduct 110 concerts in 30 weeks for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and to give 25 piano recitals. He was worried about such a commitment in an unfamiliar country and had few good memories from his debut tour in 1909, so he declined all three. Not long after his decision, Rachmaninoff considered the United States financially advantageous as he could not support his family through composition alone. Unable to afford the travel fees, he was sent an advance loan for the journey by Russian banker and fellow emigre Alexander Kamenka. After the first tour ended in April 1919, Rachmaninoff took his family on a break to San Francisco. As a touring performer Rachmaninoff became financially secure without much difficulty, and the family lived an upper middle class life with servants, a chef, and chauffeur. They recreated the atmosphere of Ivanovka in their New York City apartment by entertaining Russian guests, employing Russians, and continuing to observe Russian customs."

 elgar.1851.h: "Invite him to the USA and give him a warm welcome."
 elgar.1861.t: "Piano Concerto No. 3"
 elgar.1861.f: "At that time Mahler was the only conductor whom I considered worthy to be classed with Nikisch. He devoted himself to the concerto until the accompaniment, which is rather complicated, had been practiced to perfection, although he had already gone through another long rehearsal. According to Mahler, every detail of the score was important - an attitude too rare amongst conductors. ... Though the rehearsal was scheduled to end at 12:30, we played and played, far beyond this hour, and when Mahler announced that the first movement would be rehearsed again, I expected some protest or scene from the musicians, but I did not notice a single sign of annoyance. The orchestra played the first movement with a keen or perhaps even closer appreciation than the previous time. - Sergei Rachmaninoff"
 elgar.1862.t: "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini"
 elgar.1862.f: "The piece consists of 24 variations on a theme that Niccolò Paganini himself used as the starting point for a series of variations. This melody has repeatedly served as a template for various composers, including Johannes Brahms and Franz Liszt. In some variations, Rachmaninoff uses another, much older melody: the sequence 'Dies irae', once an integral part of the Latin mass for the dead. Rachmaninoff used this theme again and again in his works. It appears in all the symphonies, the Symphonic Dances, the symphonic poem Die Toteninsel and the first piano sonata. The combination of a Paganini theme with the 'Dies irae' prompts the search for a programmatic background to the work. According to legend, the great violinist sold his soul to the devil in order to achieve perfection on his instrument and the love of a woman. The 'Dies irae' motif stands for the devil, the Paganini theme for the composing violinist himself."
 elgar.1863.t: "Symphony No. 3"
 elgar.1863.f: "'It was played in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, etc. At the first two performances I was present. It was played wonderfully. Its reception by both the public and critics was sour. One review sticks painfully in my mind: that I didn't have a Third Symphony in me any more. Personally, I am firmly convinced that this is a good work. But—sometimes composers are mistaken too! Be that as it may, I am holding to my opinion so far.' - Sergei Rachmaninoff"

 elgar.1901.t: "Scythian Suite"
 elgar.1901.d: "Sergei Prokofiev, one of the most promising young talents in Russian music, shocked the audience today with a scandalous performance."
 elgar.1901.f: "Prokofiev originally wrote the music for the ballet Ala i Lolli, the story of which takes place among the Scythians. Commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, the ballet was written to a scenario by Russian poet Sergey Gorodetsky. But when Diaghilev rejected the score even before its completion, the composer reworked the music into a suite for concert performance. The performance became the biggest scandal in the history of Prokofiev's premieres. The director of the Conservatory at the time, Alexander Glazunov, left the hall during the concert, the majority of the audience was outraged and the reviews were devastating. However, Prokofiev was not very impressed and the next day wrote succinctly to Moscow that the performance had gone on 'with a real racket'."
 elgar.1911.t: "Prokofiev arrives in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 elgar.1911.f: "As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres, Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century. Prokofiev himself explained his style as an interplay of four basic lines. The 'classical line' is expressed on the one hand in his interest in historicizing elements such as old dances and on the other hand in his adherence to traditional forms. The 'modern line', on the other hand, includes his fondness for daring harmonies, dissonances and unusual chord combinations. Sometimes it leads to the extreme limits of tonality. Finally, Prokofiev names the 'motor line' as the third. Many of his works are characterized by penetrating rhythms and wild motor skills. In contrast to this is the fourth 'lyrical line'. Again and again Prokofiev managed to create moments of harsh lyricism and quiet resignation and to compose expressive melodies. His work as a composer of film music was also significant. Alexander Newski is considered a key work in the history of film music that has been analyzed many times. Prokofiev's score influenced and shaped modern film music in the classic-romantic style, which created clear copies of the style."
 elgar.1912.t: "Prokofiev departs"
 elgar.1941.t: "Symphony No. 1 'Classical'"
 elgar.1941.d: "With his first symphony, Sergei Prokofiev has once again recommended himself as an up-and-coming composer. On the other hand, it pushes the young artist out into the world to be better paid."
 elgar.1941.f: "'Rehearsal of the Classical Symphony with the State Orchestra, I conducted it myself, completely improvising, having forgotten the score and never indeed having studied it from a conducting perspective. I thought it might be a complete debacle, but nothing happened and in any case the parts has so many mistakes in them that the session turned mainly into one for making corrections. In Kislovodsk, I had worried that there would be some antagonism from a 'Revolutionary Orchestra' playing my new works, but the opposite was the case: the State Orchestra, infused with much new young blood, was flexible and attentive, and played the Symphony with evident enjoyment.' - Sergei Prokofiev"
 elgar.1941.g: "A nice performance, but we don't have use for him."
 elgar.1951.t: "Prokofiev and Paris"
 elgar.1951.d: "Composer Sergei Prokofiev is considering settling in Paris long-term, but is having trouble finding a decent living."
 elgar.1951.f: "On his tours, Prokofiev spent numerous stays in Paris, where he was in constant contact with other Russians, such as Diaghilev. At the same time he made friends with progressive French artists such as Francis Poulenc and Arthur Honegger. While the German music world remained uninteresting for him, apart from a short stay in Ettal, France seemed to be his spiritual second home."
 elgar.1951.g: "He's supposed to perform a concert, but we don't have the capacity for a position."
 elgar.1951.h: "Prokofiev is welcome with us. Make him a home."
 elgar.1961.t: "Romeo and Juliet"
 elgar.1961.f: "Romeo and Juliet is Sergei Prokofiev's longest and best-known ballet and is widely regarded as his most important contribution to the genre. It is considered a highlight of his musical work. The rich and varied instrumentation as well as the rhythmic complexity of the score still pose challenges for orchestra and dancers. In some places, dissonances border on atonality. The famous 'Dance of the Knights', with its dotted rhythms, is now better known as a quasi-symphonic theme. In contrast, the themes associated with Juliet's awakening to love are at once tender and youthfully lively. Prokofiev reused music from the ballet in three suites for orchestra and a solo piano work."
 elgar.1962.t: "Lieutenant Kijé"
 elgar.1962.f: "Lieutenant Kijé music was originally written to accompany the film of the same name. It was Prokofiev's first attempt at film music, and his first commission. In the early days of sound cinema, among the various distinguished composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance. Soon after the film's release, Prokofiev received an invitation from the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra to create an orchestral suite from his Kijé film music - probably the first instance of a film score being adapted into a significant musical work. While Prokofiev was in the United States for the Boston premiere he was greatly sought after by film producers, but although he was flattered and attracted by their offers he never composed a Hollywood film score."
 elgar.1963.t: "Peter and the Wolf"
 elgar.1963.f: "Peter and the Wolf is a 'symphonic fairy tale for children'. It is Prokofiev's most frequently performed work and one of the most frequently performed works in the entire classical repertoire. The narrator tells a children's story, while the orchestra illustrates it by using different instruments to play a 'theme' that represents each character in the story: 'Each character of this tale is represented by a corresponding instrument in the orchestra: the bird by a flute, the duck by an oboe, the cat by a clarinet playing staccato in a low register, the grandfather by a bassoon, the wolf by three horns, Peter by the string quartet, the shooting of the hunters by the kettle drums and bass drum. Before an orchestral performance it is desirable to show these instruments to the children and to play on them the corresponding leitmotifs. Thereby, the children learn to distinguish the sounds of the instruments during the performance of this tale.'"
