 je_gaudi_splendid_architecture: "Splendid New Architecture" #NT!
 je_gaudi_splendid_architecture_reason: "With the introduction of Art Nouveau and Art Deco, architects revolutionized the art world, for example by breaking with the rigid historicism of the past. But unlike many modern schools, their buildings were not an expression of mere functionality and objectivity. Art Deco is a development in the midst of the general awakening of classical modernism, in which the creative combination of elegance of form, preciousness of materials, strength of colors and sensuality of the topic was in the foreground. During its heyday, it represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. An architecture that respects these principles would make our nation a poster child of modernity and wealth." #NT!
 je_gaudi_splendid_architecture_goal: "#E Splendid Architecture#! reaches #BLUE 10#! points. At the moment, we have #G [ROOT.Var('gaudi_splendid_architecture').GetValue]#! @gaudi_architectural_splendor! points. Building Art Nouveau quarters, Art Deco Cinemas, Art Deco Skyscrapers, Art Deco Offices and Art Deco Airports via Journal Entry will give you more points." #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_nouveau_quarter: "Art Nouveau Quarter" #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_nouveau_quarter_reason: "The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Hôtel Tassel was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Horta's work in Brussels and applied the style for the entrances of the new Paris Métro. From Belgium and France, Art Nouveau spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country. It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities (Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany) as well as in centres of independence movements (Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain)." #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_deco_cinema: "Art Deco Cinema" #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_deco_cinema_reason: "Many of the best surviving examples of Art Deco are cinemas built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Art Deco period coincided with the conversion of silent films to sound, and movie companies built large display destinations in major cities to capture the huge audience that came to see movies.

Simultaneously with the construction of the crypt, Gaudí began to fundamentally redesign the plans for the church. In 1885 he presented a new overall concept with a Gothic design language, in which 18 towers are recognizable, albeit on a smaller scale than in the current project. The outer wall of the apse, completed in 1893, is taller than del Villar's project.

He wanted to 'break' arcs and 'cut' columns, and to use the effect of chiaroscuro (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice. Facing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Façade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble strained muscles." #NT!

When the star was set in its place on 10 April 1889, it brought the total height of the Mole to 167.5 m (550 ft), making it the tallest brick building in Europe at the time." #NT!

 gaudi_ringstrasse_phase_1_decision_desc: "The Vienna Ring Road was constructed after the dismantling of the city walls in the mid-19th century. From the 1860s to 1890s, many large public buildings were erected along the Ringstrasse in an eclectic historicist style, sometimes called Ringstraßenstil ('Ring Road style'), using elements of Classical, Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque architecture. Numerous public and private buildings were erected along the entire ring road. Aristocrats and other wealthy private individuals hastened to have representative palaces (ring road palaces) built in the monumental historicist style." #NT!

But at that time it was still dominated by fallow land. One of the most important projects in the years that followed was the realization of a large new opera house, which later became the Vienna State Opera. The New Town Hall was also built during this period, during which the Ringstrasse was transformed from a mere avenue into a new center of Vienna dominated by palaces and public buildings." #NT!

 gaudi_sagrada_phase_1_decision_desc: "Antoni Gaudí i Cornet was a Catalan architect and designer from Spain known as the greatest exponent of Catalan Modernism. Gaudí's works have a highly individualized, sui generis style. In 1883 Gaudí was put in charge of the recently initiated project to build a Barcelona church called Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família. Gaudí completely changed the initial design and imbued it with his own distinctive style. Until his death he devoted himself entirely to this project. For decades, the Sagrada Família would be the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world - a project of the century between genius and madness." #NT!

 gaudi_sagrada_phase_2_decision_desc: "Gaudí completed the crypt that he had begun essentially according to del Villar's plans, with the vaults being a revision by Gaudí. In the mid-1880s, the first services could be celebrated in it and the crypt was completed in 1889. Simultaneously with the construction of the crypt, Gaudí began to fundamentally redesign the plans for the church. In 1885 he presented a new overall concept with a Gothic design language, in which 18 towers are recognizable, albeit on a smaller scale than in the current project. The outer wall of the apse, completed in 1893, is taller than del Villar's project. It contains neo-Gothic elements, but shows Gaudí's signature in the idiosyncratic use of the Gothic forms, the naturalistic gargoyles and the pinnacle tips." #NT!

Characteristic of Gaudí's naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner. The façade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ. It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity). The Tree of Life rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity." #NT!

 gaudi_sagrada_phase_4_decision_desc: "The church plan is that of a Latin cross with five aisles. The columns of the interior are a unique Gaudí design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. Essentially none of the interior surfaces are flat; the ornamentation is comprehensive and rich, consisting in large part of abstract shapes which combine smooth curves and jagged points. Even detail-level work such as the iron railings for balconies and stairways are full of curvaceous elaboration." #NT!

 gaudi_sagrada_phase_5_decision_desc: "Gaudí's original design calls for a total of eighteen spires, representing in ascending order of height the Twelve Apostles, the Virgin Mary, the four Evangelists and, tallest of all, Jesus Christ. All of the towers, whose shapes are intended to evoke a bishop's crosier, have long vertical notches and colorful spiers that are decorated with animals or sacred symbols and quotations from the Bible. They carry a small golden cross with the name of the respective apostle. Some of the towers are connected by narrow stone bridges." #NT!

 gaudi_sagrada_phase_6_decision_desc: "In contrast to the highly decorated Nativity Façade, the Passion Façade is austere, plain and simple, with ample bare stone, and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton. Dedicated to the Passion of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his crucifixion, the façade was intended to portray the sins of man. Gaudí intended for this façade to strike fear into the onlooker. He wanted to 'break' arcs and 'cut' columns, and to use the effect of chiaroscuro (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice. Facing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Façade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble strained muscles." #NT!

The terminals of the towers are 22.5 m high, made up of three different parts: the base is made up of four lines of hexagons with the inscriptions Al·leluia and Amen surrounded by herringbone-shaped ceramic palms; in the central part there is an icosahedron intersected with a sphere covered with ceramic trencadís and Venetian glass, which contains the lighting sources; and, as a finish, there are the sculptures of the Tetramorphs, winged and with an evangelical book with the initials of each evangelist. The tower of Mary is located on the apse and is topped by a large twelve-pointed star, which symbolizes the morning star. In addition, it carries several iconographic elements alluding to the Virgin, such as the Hail Mary and various flowers as a symbol of the attributes of the mother of Jesus." #NT!

Dedicated to the Celestial Glory of Jesus, it represents the road to God: Death, Final Judgment, and Glory, while Hell is left for those who deviate from God's will. To reach the Glory Portico the large staircase leads over the underground passage built over Carrer de Mallorca with the decoration representing Hell and vice. It will be decorated with demons, idols, false gods, heresy and schisms, etc. Purgatory and death will also be depicted, the latter using tombs along the ground.

Each of the four arms of the cross has powerful beams of light that are visible at great distances, in remembrance of the biblical passage that defines Jesus as 'I am the light of the world'.

They resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists in protest against its support for more traditional artistic styles. Their most influential architectural work was the Secession Building designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich as a venue for expositions of the group. Their official magazine was called Ver Sacrum (Sacred Spring, in Latin), which published highly stylised and influential works of graphic art. In 1905 the group itself split, when some of the most prominent members, including Klimt, Wagner, and Hoffmann, resigned in a dispute over priorities, but it continued to function, and still functions today, from its headquarters in the Secession Building. In its current form, the Secession exhibition gallery is independently led and managed by artists." #NT!

Important artists included Gustave Strauven, who used wrought iron to achieve baroque effects on Brussels facades; the furniture designer Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, known for his highly original chairs and articulated metal furniture; and the jewellery designer Philippe Wolfers, who made jewellery in the form of dragonflies, butterflies, swans and serpents. The style was quickly noticed in neighbouring France. After visiting Horta's Hôtel Tassel, Hector Guimard built the Castel Béranger, among the first Paris buildings in the new style. Parisians welcomed Guimard's original and picturesque style; the Castel Béranger was chosen as one of the best new façades in Paris, launching Guimard's career. The Paris 1900 Exposition universelle marked the high point of Art Nouveau. Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware, furniture and decorative objects of the style. While the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much to popularize the style." #NT!

In the 1920s, New York architects used the new Art Deco style to build the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. The Empire State building was the tallest building in the world for forty years.

Later, publicists celebrated Cologne Cathedral as a work of art that was still waiting to be completed. Finally, the Catholic publicist Joseph Görres shifted the argument when in 1814 he praised the cathedral as a national sanctuary and thus made it a symbol for the desired German national state. Sulpiz Boisserée, an art dealer based in Cologne, was at the center of the persistent campaigning for the completion of the cathedral. His efforts received a boost when, in 1814 and 1816, he and Georg Moller were able to rediscover the façade plan from 1370 that underlies the west façade of the cathedral. Between 1821 and 1831 Boisserée published a series of engravings showing the completed cathedral. This work significantly promoted enthusiasm for cathedral construction throughout Germany. The romantic transfiguration of the Gothic, which was understood at the time as a genuinely German architectural style, and the stylization of the cathedral as a German national monument finally won over the Prussian Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm to the cathedral project. The idea of completing the cathedral, originally pursued in Cologne, thus became a Prussian and even national-German matter and, for the first time, a realistic option." #NT!

With the forthcoming completion of Cologne Cathedral, our nation has freed itself from earlier decadence and is following in the footsteps of its ancestors. When has any country ever implemented a major project? You have to go back to the cathedral builders of the Middle Ages - or even to the builders of the pyramids. We are entering historical territory. And future generations, as they look up at the colossal towers, will remember that we made the right decision back then. A cathedral is more than a church.

 gaudi.118.f: "The importance of the cathedral for the Germans as a 'united' people was important from the very beginning when considerations began to complete the medieval building. The Middle Ages were considered by many to be a place of reflection for the German nation, as the Holy Roman Empire, especially under the Salians and Staufers, was perceived as the high point of Germany. Others saw it as a dilution of the Christian idea. After all, the cathedral was not just a church, but the seat of one of the most powerful bishops in Germany. Cologne's Christian history began in the Roman Empire, and the question of God and nation could often lead to divisive rather than conciliatory tendencies." #NT!

On this basis, the annual construction costs were calculated at 100,000 thalers, half of which the Prussian king wanted to cover with a building fund. In order to raise the remaining construction costs, the Central Cathedral Building Association (Zentral-Dombau-Verein) in Cologne was founded, which was initially financed by contributions. When the interior was completed in 1863, projections showed that, assuming the same financial flow, it would take another 50 years to complete. So the association decided in 1864 to set up a cathedral lottery, which proved to be a good source of money. Overall, the Dombau-Verein bore around 60 percent of all costs, the state was only involved in around 32 percent of the cathedral building costs." #NT!

This supremacy drew critics to the scene. The democratic movement demanded more say for the people in political issues. The sworn circle of politicians around Alfred Escher - the 'Escher system' - became the declared enemy of the democrats. This was fought against with pamphlets and popular assemblies, which ultimately weakened his influence. It became even more difficult by the fact that his Northeast Railway increasingly slipped into financial crisis in the 1870s." #NT!

His susceptibility to illness did not go well with his heavy workload. During the critical phase of the Gotthard project, Escher almost worked himself to death. Constant health ups and downs followed: asthma, fever, eye problems, boils. However, this did not prevent Escher from fulfilling his political and economic obligations whenever possible. At the end of November 1882 he became seriously ill again. On the morning of December 6, 1882, Alfred Escher died on his estate 'Belvoir'." #NT!

The decision was made when Alfred Escher, the president of the Zurich-based Swiss Northeastern Railway, finally endorsed the route over the Gotthard. In addition, the route over the Gotthard was the shortest. 'I have long been convinced that as a result of the design of the railway network in Switzerland and our neighboring countries, a railway over the Gotthard would be much more beneficial to the interests of Zurich and the Northeastern Railway than a railway over an Alpine pass in Graubünden,' says Escher." #NT!

The Geneva company 'Entreprise du Grand Tunnel du Gothard' of Louis Favre was awarded the contract.

Grattoni had already built the world's longest tunnel, the Mont Cenis railway tunnel, at 12 kilometers. He had also dealt with the Gotthard, had examined the geology and carried out test drilling. Favre, who had never built a tunnel longer than 1,000 meters, undercut his fellow competitors, accepted the ruinous terms of the contract and posted a deposit of CHF 8 million.

After the financing of the Gotthard project had been secured almost exclusively by state subsidies from Switzerland, its cantons and from 1869 by Italy, the North German Confederation and its legal successor from 1871 the German Reich, the Gotthard Railway Company was founded from the Gotthard Association, which transferred its rights to the Gotthard Railway Company.

Italian tunnel workers went on strike, demanding more wages and causing an uproar in the village. The trigger was a dispute between a post chief and the miners, who refused to continue drilling until the smoke cleared from the blasts. A war of words then broke out until the miners left the work site in a rage. On the way out, a rumor spread that a box of dynamite was on fire. This caused the rest of the tunnel crew to run outside as well. The workers moved on to the village, where they stopped in front of the post office, where the mayor and postman lived, and vented their anger. Here Luigi Dissune presented the demands of the workers to applause: one franc more wages per day, functioning ventilation and better safety regulations. The threat that no more miners would go into the tunnel until this was completely fulfilled was reinforced by taking up post in front of the tunnel portal so that no miners were allowed into the tunnel at the 10 p.m. shift change." #NT!

Famed in France as a portraitist, he was recruited by Paul Landowski into the team that began work on Christ the Redeemer in 1922. Gheorghe Leonida contributed by depicting the face of Jesus Christ on the statue, a fact that made him famous. A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's presentations and made the decision to build the structure out of reinforced concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) rather than steel, which would be more appropriate for a cruciform statue. The outer layers are made of soapstone, chosen for its durability and ease of use. It took nine years to build and cost the equivalent of $250,000 (or $3.3 million in 2014 value)." #NT!

The new synagogue was designed to demonstrate the presence, advancement, and integration of the city's Jewish citizens. The nominated architect Alessandro Antonelli was to take on the job. However, Antonelli was also known for his monumental buildings, the dimensions of which he expanded. In the Piedmontese town of Castellamonte, for example, Antonelli had planned a cathedral that would have rivaled that of St. Peter's in Rome; but the mammoth project remained unfinished because of the lack of financing. A similar fate now threatened the Jewish community with its new synagogue, which grew sky-high by the day, but threatened to become a financial disaster for the Jewish community. The Turin city authorities bought the building and compensated the Jews with new land and a new synagogue, which was built in a few years.

From 90 meters upwards he therefore broke with the square-based architectural theme, designing a granite colonnade with a circular base, called the 'Lantern', placed on a truncated cone base. Likewise, the architect also conceived the design of a spire of about 50 meters above the Lantern, with an octagonal section, and interspersed with ten circular terraces, the first two still equipped with a colonnade, then upwards gradually more and more small, and accessible by a small zig-zag ladder." #NT!

A few months after his death, the architect suggested finishing the spire with a statue depicting a 'Winged Genius'. The design of the statue was commissioned to the sculptor Fumagalli; the Genius, made of embossed and gilded copper, weighed about 300 kg, and had a spear in one hand and a palm branch in the other. The statue reached a total height of 5.46 meters. After Antonelli's death, the completion of the spire was overseen above all by his son Costanzo and his pupil Crescentino Caselli. With the final laying of the 'Winged Genius', the building reached an overall height of 167.35 metres, a height, at the time, never reached by any masonry construction in Europe and the world. The Mole, the tallest masonry construction in the world, entered into direct 'competition' with the Eiffel Tower in Paris, inaugurated just 10 days earlier and which would have been the tallest building in the world until 1930." #NT!

All the Viennese newspapers were available in a better Viennese coffee house, and not just the Viennese ones, but those of the entire German Reich, French, English, Italian, and American, as well as all the important literary and artistic reviews in the world. So we knew everything that was going on in the world first hand, we heard about every book that was published, about every performance, wherever it was taking place, and compared the reviews in all the newspapers. Perhaps nothing contributed so much to the intellectual flexibility and international orientation of the Austrian as the fact that he was able to orientate himself so comprehensively about all events in the world in the coffee house and at the same time discuss them in friendly circles.

The resulting fire spread to the backdrop trains before rapidly spreading to the rest of the stage and eventually the auditorium. The fire had domestic and international effects on preventive fire protection, especially in the theater area and the corresponding legal provisions for theater construction in Austria.

The barracks were named after Emperor Franz Joseph I and built in 1854-1857 in the wake of the 1848 revolution. Shortly after its construction, the barracks stood in the way of the development of the Vienna Ringstrasse, which began in 1857, but it took four decades for the army to move out of here again.

This park was planned in the style of English landscape parks by the landscape painter Joseph Sellény. At the water glacis there was a spa pavilion where medicinal water was served for drinking cures. Accordingly, the Kursalon was built for the city park according to plans by Johann Garben.

As a cultural institution, the Vienna State Opera is the successor to the Vienna Court Opera, which was founded and promoted by the Habsburgs. In addition, the Vienna State Opera Orchestra continues the tradition of the Vienna Court Orchestra, which has been in use since 1498. In 1860, the new building for the Court Opera was tendered as the first monumental building on the Ringstrasse to be financed from Vienna's city expansion fund. Numerous architects took part in the architectural competition. The construction was based on plans by the architects August Sicard von Sicardsburg and Eduard van der Nüll in neo-Renaissance style. The building was not well appreciated by the public. On the one hand, compared to the huge Heinrichshof, a private apartment building, it could not develop a real monumental effect. Mockery and criticism eventually drove van der Nüll to commit suicide. Since Emperor Franz Joseph had also criticized the architect, he was shocked.

The town hall facade is an outstanding example of a neo-Gothic secular building. The exterior, particularly the 98 m high tower, is inspired by the tradition of Flemish Gothic town halls, such as the Brussels Town Hall on the Grand-Place/Grote Markt, to tie in externally with the medieval tradition of urban freedom.

The plan was to create a rectangular square that would be framed by the Leopoldine Wing, the New Hofburg, the Habsburg Collections and by a counterpart of the New Castle that was never built on the site of the Volksgarten. The name Heldenplatz was fixed in 1878; it comes from the two equestrian monuments, both of which are by Anton Dominik Fernkorn. The older one is Archduke Karl's, which was unveiled in 1860. The counterpart, the equestrian statue of Prince Eugene, was also completed in 1865. After the loss of World War I, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy under the rule of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty and the founding of the first Austrian republic, Heldenplatz served as a rallying point for all political camps and as a parade ground for the Austrian army." #NT!

He also gave folklore lectures and developed the idea of a folk-educational institution. However, since he was called to Berlin in 1885, he continued to develop his ideas there. The Urania in Vienna was modeled on the Urania in Berlin: it had space for 800 people and contained a lecture hall for 200 people, rooms for scientific demonstrations and an observatory. However, this 'temporary' Urania could hardly cope with the influx of visitors, so that a new building on Ringstrasse soon became necessary. The Urania not only expanded its range of educational opportunities (e.g. through language courses), but also became a venue for concerts, with its own Urania symphony orchestra and Urania choir.

However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may modify the form of the dilemma. Either we do know all the varieties of beings which people our planet, or we do not. If we do not know them all, if Nature has still secrets in ichthyology for us, nothing is more conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or cetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organization formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an accident of some sort, either fantastical or capricious, has brought at long intervals to the upper level of the ocean.'" #NT!

The aim was to measure the fluctuations of the earth's magnetic field in a coordinated manner using numerous measuring stations distributed all over the world. During a six-year period from 1836 to 1841, measurements were taken on 28 appointment days, each lasting 24 hours at intervals of five minutes. Up to 50 observatories took part in this project, including 35 in Europe, six in Asia, two in Africa, three in North America and four in the South Seas.

From the Spaniards destroyed and rebuilt as a colonial metropolis, the city became the seat of the centralist Colonial administration. At the end of the 19th century the importance was strengthened by the expansion of the railway network. With the beginning of the 20th century, in addition to its function as a financial and trading center, the city gained importance as an industrial location. The prospect of work attracted hundreds of thousands to the capital over decades. Construction projects such as the Palacio de Bellas Artes provided an incentive." #NT!

 je_gaudi_magnetic_observation_reason: "Carl Friedrich Gauß built the first geophysical observatory in Göttingen and constructed a sensitive magnetometer for it in 1832. He realized that globally distributed measurements would have to be carried out at the same time in order to be able to localize the causes of the fluctuations and measure the static field more precisely. From 1836 onwards, the Magnetic Association founded for this purpose and the British Royal Society provided data that he and Wilhelm Weber evaluated. The aim was to measure the fluctuations of the earth's magnetic field in a coordinated manner using numerous measuring stations distributed all over the world. Up to 50 observatories took part in this project, including 35 in Europe, six in Asia, two in Africa, three in North America and four in Oceania. The results were delivered to Göttingen and scientifically processed by Gauß and Weber." #NT!

Morse's assistant Alfred Vail developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet. Morse and Vail developed the Morse code signalling alphabet. The first telegram in the United States was sent by Morse on 11 January 1838, across two miles (3 km) of wire at Speedwell Ironworks near Morristown, New Jersey, although it was only later, in 1844, that he sent the message "WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT" over the 44 miles (71 km) from the Capitol in Washington to the old Mt.

Wireless telegraphy claimed Dr. Braun's full attention in 1898, and for many years after that he applied himself almost exclusively to the task of solving its problems.

Otis elevators worked in the north and south pillars until 1910. Until 1897 there were elevators from Roux, Combaluzie and Lepape in the east and west pillars. They could transport up to 200 people with the help of an endless double chain. Both systems were operated by a hydraulic conveyor system.

The work shifts lasted nine hours in the winter months and twelve hours in the summer months. In September 1888 there was a workers' strike; three months later they stopped work again and demanded more wages. Gustave Eiffel negotiated with them and set up a canteen for them in the first platform that had already been completed. There was only one fatal accident during the entire work.

The individual parts, pre-drilled in the factory, were brought into their final position on site using conical mandrels under impact. A total of 2.5 million rivets hold the components together in the Eiffel Tower. Four men each carried out the riveting. The first worker had the rivet hot-stamped and made it glow using a small forge. As a second step, another worker guided the rivet to the drill hole. A third beat the locking head into shape.

Augustus W. N. Pugin, the foremost expert on the Gothic, had to submit each of his designs through, and thus in the name of, other architects, James Gillespie Graham and Charles Barry, because he had recently openly and fervently converted to Roman Catholicism.
