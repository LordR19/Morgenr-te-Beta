 mendelejew.101.d: "After extensive studies and investigations, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] postulated that there must still be an unknown element. The chemist calls this hypothetical #YELLOW Element Number [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_thought_variable').GetValue|0]#!. However, it still awaits discovery." #NT!
 mendelejew.101.f: "The term chemical element arose in the 17th century when it was increasingly recognized that the concept of elements in alchemy was unsuitable for a scientific explanation of the diverse properties of substances and their reactions with one another. Robert Boyle published an influential critique of the inadequacies of alchemy in 1661 called 'The Sceptical Chymist'. In it he explained that by chemical elements one should understand those primitive substances 'which have neither arisen from other substances nor from each other, but which form the components of which mixed substances are made'." #NT!

 mendelejew.102.d: "In his recent research, Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has determined that, given current knowledge, there must be other unknown elements. It is still unknown how exactly these can be determined, but a hypothesis should soon be formulated." #NT!
 mendelejew.102.f: "The term 'elements' (stoicheia) was first used by Greek philosopher Plato around 360 BCE in his dialogue Timaeus, which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a speculative treatise on chemistry. Plato believed the elements introduced a century earlier by Empedocles were composed of small polyhedral forms: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air), icosahedron (water), and cube (earth)." #NT!

However, the current obligations in the course of element research cause problems in the curriculum. There are already complaints that seminars and lectures are being neglected." #NT!
 mendelejew.111.f: "The German chemistry professor Justus von Liebig was particularly popular among his students because of his modern learning methods. His discoveries and writings soon made him known worldwide, with the result that, in addition to many Germans, numerous foreigners, including 84 English and 18 Americans, came to Giessen to hear Liebig's lectures on chemistry and pharmacy." #NT!

 mendelejew.112.f: "'I was sitting writing on my textbook, but the work did not progress; my thoughts were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire and dozed. Again the atoms were gamboling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by the repeated visions of the kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold conformation; long rows sometimes more closely fitted together all twining and twisting in snake-like motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and this time also I spent the rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth ... but let us beware of publishing our dreams before they have been put to the proof by the waking understanding.' -August Kekulé" #NT!

Dr. [ROOT.Var('mendelejew_chemist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has so far only intended it for private use, but an assistant insists that it should be completed and published instead of just seeing it as a sketch." #NT!
 mendelejew.113.f: "Not only in chemistry, but in almost every academic discipline, it can happen that the research result actually sought is not achieved, but on the way there are much more interesting discoveries that are only recorded through hasty writing. It can often happen that the goal is briefly lost in order to devote oneself to something more groundbreaking." #NT!

 mendelejew.115.f: "Even before the discovery of spectroscopy, but especially after, chemistry and astronomy continued to influence each other. Spectroscopy was initially used as an astronomical technique with experiments by William Hyde Wollaston, who built the first spectrometer to display the spectral lines of the sun's rays. These spectral lines were later characterized by Josef von Fraunhofer. Later, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen discovered that each chemical element was associated with a specific number and arrangement of spectral lines. They concluded from this that the lines observed by Wollaston and Fraunhofer were due to the absorption properties of these elements in the upper layers of the sun and that these must therefore also be present in the photosphere." #NT!

 mendelejew.202.f: "Of the elements in today's sense, only ten elements were known in their pure form in ancient times, which either occurred naturally or could be smelted from ore: carbon, sulfur, iron, copper, zinc, silver, tin, gold, mercury and lead. In the course of medieval mining history, small amounts of admixtures of unknown metals were discovered in ores, especially in the Ore Mountains, and were named after mountain spirits (cobalt, nickel). The discovery of phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand finally ushered in the age of discovery of most elements, including uranium from pitchblende by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1789." #NT!

 mendelejew.203.f: "'I tried out various experiments described in treatises on physics and chemistry, and the results were sometimes unexpected. At times, I would be encouraged by a little unhoped-for success; at others, I would be in the deepest despair because of accidents and failures resulting from my inexperience.' -Marie Curie" #NT!

There is an urgent need to purchase new instruments and equipment. Otherwise, the discovery of new elements could be significantly delayed." #NT!
 mendelejew.211.f: "Setting up laboratories and purchasing new equipment or instruments was anything but a given. In many places, chemistry was still viewed negatively at the beginning of the 19th century. Despite his important rank, the chemist Justus von Liebig even had to pay for his laboratory equipment himself." #NT!

 mendelejew.212.f: "A chemical compound is a chemical substance composed of many identical molecules (or molecular entities) containing atoms from more than one chemical element held together by chemical bonds. A molecule consisting of atoms of only one element is therefore not a compound. A compound can be transformed into a different substance by a chemical reaction, which may involve interactions with other substances.

 mendelejew.215.f: "Without new minerals that geologists have cataloged, the discovery of many chemical elements would not have been possible. In 1839, the German-Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein coined the term geochemistry. It is based on the concept of not only describing minerals, but also understanding the material basis and the chemical dynamics behind them." #NT!

 mendelejew.302.f: "The first modern list of elements was given in Antoine Lavoisier's 1789 Elements of Chemistry, which contained 33 elements, including light and caloric.

This will benefit the economy and industry as well as science." #NT!
 mendelejew.311.f: "Chemical synthesis (chemical combination) is the artificial execution of chemical reactions to obtain one or several products. This occurs by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions. In modern laboratory uses, the process is reproducible and reliable. A chemical synthesis involves one or more compounds (known as reagents or reactants) that will experience a transformation when subjected to certain conditions. Various reaction types can be applied to formulate a desired product. This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel, such as a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask. Many reactions require some form of processing or purification procedure to isolate the final product" #NT!

 mendelejew.312.f: "Dissociation in chemistry is a general process in which molecules (or ionic compounds such as salts, or complexes) separate or split into other things such as atoms, ions, or radicals, usually in a reversible manner. For instance, when an acid dissolves in water, a covalent bond between an electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom is broken by heterolytic fission, which gives a proton (H+) and a negative ion.

 mendelejew.314.f: "The newspapers are still reporting on the failed fire brigade operation, whose use of water fueled the chemical reaction even more instead of reducing the damage. Several students complained of smoke inhalation, and there were several injuries in the laboratory. The university building in the Faculty of Science has suffered significant damage and will have to be closed for months, if not years.

Different “schools” represented different views, particularly on questions of atomic and molecular construction. According to John Dalton, they were generally accepted as the smallest building blocks of chemical compounds, but next to nothing was known about their structure. Different views were also held on other fundamental theoretical questions such as the base size of atomic weights. The nomenclature and formula writing were also highly inconsistent. However, there was still no forum in which the current problems could be discussed. That's why three young professors of chemistry took the initiative to organize a congress in order to clarify the controversial questions in a discussion with colleagues in the field and invited the most important representatives of the subject to Karlsruhe for September 3rd to 5th, 1860." #NT!

 mendelejew.604.f: "There was no agreement on several topics at the Karlsruhe Congress of 1860. One of the most important topics was atomic and molecular weights. Based on the findings of previous chemists, there was agreement that atoms are discrete particles and molecules are built from them, but several systems of atomic weights were used side by side. One was based on hydrogen, which was assigned the value 1 as the base unit, carbon was assigned 6 and oxygen was assigned 8. As long as there were uncertainties about the atomic weights, the elemental composition of the compounds examined was doubtful. There were up to five different weighting options, and because of the complicated conversions, some chemists were inclined not to change anything at all." #NT!

This is a direct hydrogenation that is carried out in two phases.

 mendelejew.701.f: "Systematic research into equivalent substitutes for the production of gasoline began in Germany after the First World War.

On the other hand, US scientists predicted in a study that was taken seriously around the world that global oil reserves would be exhausted in a short time, while motorization was increasing inexorably. Against this background, with government support, researchers and companies turned with great intensity to the energy source that Germany had in abundance: coal. The fact that benzene can be obtained from coal was already known at the beginning of the 19th century - long before petroleum gasoline.

He made an astonishing discovery: there is not just one, but several, unknown elements in the air. Because of their low reactivity, he named them noble gases." #NT!
 mendelejew.901.f: "Cavendish's experiments in the study of air were continued by Lord Rayleigh from 1888. He noted that nitrogen obtained from air has a different density than that obtained from the decomposition of ammonia. Rayleigh therefore suspected that there must be an as yet unknown, inert component of the air. Therefore, he and William Ramsay attempted to completely remove nitrogen from an air sample by reacting it with magnesium and isolate this unknown gas. Finally, in 1894, they succeeded in spectroscopically detecting a new element called argon. After determining the main properties of helium and argon, it was determined that these gases are monatomic, unlike the other atmospheric gases. William Ramsay then suspected that there must be a whole group of such gases that form their own group in the periodic table and he began to look for them. In 1898, he and Morris William Travers succeeded in isolating neon, krypton and xenon by fractional distillation of air." #NT!

This enabled Gustave Bouchardat to produce synthetic rubber for the first time in 1879 in a process that took several months by heating isoprene obtained from rubber with hydrochloric acid and obtaining a rubber-like substance. Around 1900, Ivan Kondakov produced the first fully synthetic rubber from 2,3-dimethylbutadiene. The first patent for the production of synthetic rubber was granted to Fritz Hofmann in 1909. So-called methyl rubber was polymerized from 2,3-dimethylbutadiene." #NT!

 mendelejew.702.f: "During both world wars, Germany lost access to its rubber sources and the search for alternatives was encouraged. During the First World War, around 2,500 tons of methyl rubber were produced at Bayer in Leverkusen from 1915 to 1918 using the Fritz Hofmann process. The first commercially usable synthetic rubber was styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), which was developed in 1926 by the German chemists Walter Bock and Eduard Tschunkur at the I.G.-farbenindustrie Leverkusen plant and registered for a patent on January 15, 1927." #NT!
