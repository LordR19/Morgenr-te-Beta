 je_nationalization_german_national_identity: "German Identity" #NT!
 je_nationalization_german_national_identity_reason: "After a few years of growing together and a few reforms, the feeling of being connected to a pan-German identity is increasingly spreading among the general population. This feeling will spread from region to region, no matter how the state sets the right framework: regions that are well served by government administrations, universities, barracks or naval bases are more likely to develop an all-German identity due to their integrative function. Heavily urbanized areas are more likely to find access to a concept that was previously only researched by intellectuals. Under perfect circumstances, one sub-state could adopt the new identity every year." #NT!

 nationalization.102.d: "Now that the entire population of Germany no longer sees itself primarily as belonging to its regional identity but to its national identity, this has an impact not only on Germans at home but also across the world." #NT!

 je_nationalization_frenchization: "Frenchization" #NT!
 je_nationalization_frenchization_reason: "From 1881 onwards, children who spoke Occitan at school were punished in accordance with minister Jules Ferry's recommendations; this led to a deprecation of the language known as la vergonha (the shaming). This also applied to other parts of France, which had been struggling under centralization efforts since the French Revolution. From the end of the 19th century, the French state increased its efforts to further reduce regional differences in favor of a monolithic identity." #NT!

 nationalization.201.d: "After years of political influence and intensive education, the population in [SCOPE.sState('frenchization_state').GetName] has become indistinguishable from other French citizens. Their lifestyle and culture corresponds to that of Paris." #NT!
 nationalization.201.f: "'The Parisian is to the French what the Athenian was to the Greeks: no one sleeps better than he, no one is more openly frivolous and idle, no one appears more heedless. But this is misleading. He is given to every kind of listlessness, but when there is glory to be won he may be inspired with every kind of fury. Give him a pike and he will enact the tenth of August, a musket and you have Austerlitz. He was the springboard of Napoleon and the mainstay of Danton. At the cry of 'la patrie' he enrols, and at the call of liberty he tears up the pavements. Beware of him!' -Victor Hugo" #NT!

 je_nationalization_swissiziation: "Swissiziation" #NT!
 je_nationalization_swissiziation_reason: "With Switzerland's transformation from a confederation of states to a federal state, the Alpine republic, in which the constituent states have jealously guarded their rights, grows together into a real nation state. Now it is time to form national feeling in order to assert a unified Swiss identity against other countries." #NT!

 je_nationalization_swiss_national_identity: "Swiss Identity" #NT!
 je_nationalization_swiss_national_identity_reason: "In the age of rampant nationalism, Switzerland also has to defend its role - in France, Italy and Germany people think that anything that speaks French, Italian or German must also be French, Italian and German. A Swiss identity of its own could assert itself against its neighbors, aware of Switzerland's peculiarities over the centuries." #NT!

 je_nationalization_italianization: "Italianization" #NT!
 je_nationalization_italianization_reason: "After the unification of Italy, Massimo d'Azeglio said that 'We have made Italy, now we must make Italians'. Even if the saying is historically questionable, it still brings to the point the truth that after Italy's political unification, internal unity was anything but stable. This doesn't just apply to the south, where the brigands were up to mischief - even in the north, outside of the bourgeois elite, most people still felt connected to their regional identity. Joint wars, high prestige, the construction of national institutions such as universities, art academies or administrative facilities are likely to ensure that a significantly stronger all-Italian identity emerges from the arduous process of national unity in the next few years." #NT!
 je_nationalization_italianization_goal: "#O National Identity Progress#! reaches #G 250#!." #NT!
  
 je_nationalization_germanization_reason: "After the founding of the German Empire in 1871, the Germans' sense of unity was already very widespread in the various federal states. The urgent need to unify the German states had existed since 1848. Only in Bavaria did a specific regional feeling prevail until well into the 20th century, but this was increasingly pushed back. Joint wars, high prestige, the construction of national institutions such as universities, art academies or administrative facilities are likely to ensure that a significantly stronger all-German identity emerges from the arduous process of national unity in the next few years." #NT!
  
 nationalization.12.t: "Brigands in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_brigant_state').GetName]" #NT!
 nationalization.12.d: "The poor conditions in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_brigant_state').GetName] have led to more and more people with no prospects joining the [SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_brigant_character').GetFullName] gang. They are now wreaking havoc in the surrounding area - to such an extent that the brigands have become a real problem. There are even supporters among the common people who see them as opponents of the government and increasing Italianization, and therefore as political and regional resisters." #NT!
 nationalization.12.f: "Brigandage in Southern Italy had existed in some form since ancient times. However its origins as outlaws targeting random travellers would evolve vastly later on in the form of the political resistance movement. After the conquest of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies in 1861 by the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia (later Kingdom of Italy), the most famous and well known form of brigandage in the area emerged. Amongst the brigands were a mixture of people, with different working backgrounds and motives; the brigands included former prisoners, bandits and other people who the Italian government regarded as common criminals, but also former soldiers and loyalists of the Bourbon army. They launched attacks not only against the Italian authorities and the land owning upper-classes, but also against common people, frequently looting villages, towns and farms, and committing armed robberies against both individuals and groups, including farmers, townspeople and rival brigand bands." #NT!
 nationalization.12.g: "Another bandit masquerading as Robin Hood!" #NT!
 nationalization.13.t: "Fear for regional heritage" #NT!
 nationalization.13.d: "Ordinary people in [SCOPE.sState('manzoni_regionalist_state').GetName] fear that the new national Italian institutions and the popularization of the Italian language could destroy the traditional way of life there. [SCOPE.sCharacter('manzoni_rural_leader_scope').GetFullName] has argued that the region's special heritage should not be ignored and that the homogenization of Italy has already progressed too far." #NT!
 nationalization.13.f: "With the failed revolution of 1848/1849, the Neo-Guelphs, as the leading arm of the Italian unity movement, became de facto powerless. They had originally spoken out in favor of a federally structured Italy under the primus inter pares presidency of the Pope. In response, centralist circles gained absolute preeminence - a phenomenon that remained prevalent well into the 20th century. Regional sensitivities were no longer taken into account but, on the contrary, regional feelings were seen as dangerous tendencies that could destroy Italian efforts at unification." #NT!
 nationalization.13.g: "[SCOPE.sState('manzoni_regionalist_state').GetName] is an Italian region like any other." #NT!
 nationalization.13.h: "We should take this special heritage into account." #NT!
 nationalization.14.t: "Dialects or languages?" #NT!
 nationalization.14.d: "The leading teachers, lecturers and professors in our country have spoken out in favor of particularly promoting the implementation of the Italian language not only in public institutions, but also in everyday life. This should significantly improve the scientific and political processes in the new Italy - but among the general population, especially the rural population, it is an extremely unpopular demand, as people there continue to speak exclusively in dialect." #NT!
 nationalization.14.f: "Even in the 18th century there was no question that the individual language varieties of the Italian peninsula were independent languages. It wasn't just Tuscan that had great prestige because of Dante Alighieri. Venetian was the official and written language of the Republic of Venice, plays such as those by Carlo Goldoni and literature were written in Venetian, which also still had a special significance as a lingua franca in the Adriatic region. Something similar can be said about Neapolitan. In the 19th century, however, the view prevailed that there was only one standard Italian variety and that all other languages in Italy were mere dialects - even though the Italian spoken in the north already had a special linguistic status. However, in the course of political movements, the reality became more and more prevalent: a language differs from a dialect in that the former has a navy and an army." #NT!
 nationalization.14.g: "Our linguistic diversity is our prestige." #NT!
 nationalization.14.h: "Speak Italian, speak clear. The rest are merely dialects." #NT!
 nationalization.15.t: "The Fate of Foscolo" #NT!
 nationalization.15.d: "As national sentiment becomes more and more evident, voices are being raised calling for the body of the great Italian poet Ugo Foscolo to be transported from Great Britain to Italy." #NT!
 nationalization.15.f: "The new Italian nation was looking for landmarks: historical events but also historical personalities. The idea of creating a tomb of artists, scientists and other great personalities based on the model of the Parthenon, similar to that in France, arose early on. Santa Croce in Florence, which had previously served as the burial place of prominent citizens, seemed the right place for this. Personalities such as Machiavelli, Michelangelo and Galileo have long been more Italian than Tuscan. Ugo Foscolo, a poet of Venetian origin from the island of Zakynthos, lived in the revolutionary years and is considered a defining figure of early Italian liberalism and nationalism. He would be the perfect addition to this gallery of great Italian minds. However, Foscolo died in exile in 1827 - in Turnham Green near London." #NT!
 nationalization.15.g: "Ask them to give us Foscolo." #NT!
 nationalization.15.h: "We would be embarrassed if they said no." #NT!
 nationalization.16.d: "The Italian government has requested that the body of the famous poet and champion of Italian nationalism, Ugo Foscolo, be handed over to them." #NT!
 nationalization.16.g: "They should have their petty little poet. What was his name again?" #NT!
 nationalization.16.h: "The Fosco-guy stays here." #NT!
 nationalization.17.t_foscolo: "Foscolo returns" #NT!
 nationalization.17.d_foscolo: "The British government has agreed - Foscolo's body will soon be back on Italian soil and will find its final resting place in the church of Santa Croce!" #NT!
 nationalization.17.f_foscolo: "Ugo Foscolo's return to Italy is considered one of the first key points for the young nation-state. Foscolo was celebrated like a returned hero; his burial was like a procession - with people crying and cheering. With the 'Pantheon' of great Italian personalities in Santa Croce, a fixed point of Italian nationalism was inaugurated that people could orientate themselves towards. The Italian heroes should would be the focus of this ideology, rather than the Catholic saints." #NT!
 nationalization.17.g: "A great Italian returns home!" #NT!
 nationalization.17.t_no_foscolo: "Foscolo remains in exile" #NT!
 nationalization.17.d_no_foscolo: "Unfortunately, the British government has prevented Ugo Foscolo from returning to Italy - using several hypocritical excuses." #NT!
 nationalization.17.f_no_foscolo: "They actually had the arrogance to refer to the great Italian poet as 'that Fosco-guy'!" #NT!
 nationalization.17.h: "These sons of a one-legged cow are denying us our Foscolo!" #NT!
 nationalization.18.t: "Italian Music Culture" #NT!
 nationalization.18.d: "Italy is considered one of the countries that played a decisive role in the development of musical culture - whether in the field of instrument making, in the development of opera, in the training of famous singers or in terms of great composers. Musically, since the Renaissance at the latest, the peninsula has been characterized by a unique musical culture that has captivated the whole of Europe and provided new impulses. The fact that Italian was the only opera language until the 19th century is evidence of this great heritage." #NT!
 nationalization.18.f: "'Give me the laundress' bill and I will set to music even that.' -Gioachino Rossini" #NT!
 nationalization.18.g: "Italy has a rich musical history." #NT!
 nationalization.18.h: "The future belongs to Italian musical culture!" #NT!
 nationalization.19.t: "Dante Cult" #NT!
 nationalization.19.d: "Dante Alighieri is considered the ultimate symbol of Italian culture, and his 'Divine Comedy' is considered one of the classics of world literature and the most important literary testimony of the Middle Ages. The worship of Dante has become a true cult among patriots and is at the same time seen as evidence to the outside world that a pan-Italian feeling existed long before the Risorgimento - after all, it was Dante who first defined the borders of Italy as the area in which the language of the 'Sì' would be spoken. A monument is to be erected in Florence that commemorates the 'supreme poet'." #NT!
 nationalization.19.f: "'Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\nmi ritrovai per una selva oscura,\nché la diritta via era smarrita.' -Dante Alighieri" #NT!
