 elgar_art_nouveau_tech_desc: "#R This technology is only available via Journal Entry!#!\n\n[concept_elgar_art_nouveau] is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts. The style is known by different names in different languages: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English. It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk ("total work of art") that would unify the arts." #NT!

 elgar_new_objectivity_tech_desc: "Although principally describing a tendency in German painting, the term took a life of its own and came to characterize the attitude of public life in Weimar Germany as well as the art, literature, music, and architecture created to adapt to it.

 elgar.9.f: "The twelve-tone technique - also known as dodecaphony, twelve-tone serialism, and (in British usage) twelve-note composition - is a method of musical composition. The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note  through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. All 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Over time, the technique increased greatly in popularity and eventually became widely influential on 20th-century composers. It is commonly considered a form of serialism." #NT!

The Great National Theater was inaugurated in one of Antonio López de Santa Anna's terms as president.

Construction of the Amazon Theatre was first proposed in 1881 by a member of the local House of Representatives, Antonio Jose Fernandes Júnior, who envisioned a 'jewel' in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. The theatre's architectural style is considered typically Renaissance Revival. The roofing tiles were imported from Alsace, the steel walls from Glasgow, Scotland and the Carrara marble for the stairs, statues and columns, from Italy. The dome is covered with 36,000 decorated ceramic tiles painted in the colors of the national flag of Brazil. The interior furnishing came from France in the Louis Quinze style.

A month before the festival was due to commence, there was not a suitable venue to hold the expected 3,000 attendees. At Liszt's urgings, and only after he offered to bear the full cost himself, the committee engaged an architect and builders to construct the Beethoven Hall. By the time they finally started, they had less than two weeks to do this, and had to work around the clock to finish it on time. Franz Liszt also spoke to the builders of Cologne Cathedral.

The Beethoven monument turned its back on the most important guests, King Frederick William IV of Prussia and the British Queen Victoria, who had taken their places on the balcony of the Fürstenberg Palace. Alexander von Humboldt saved the day by remarking that Beethoven had always been a rude fellow. Even more embarrassing was the fact that, during the toasts at the festival banquet in the 'Goldene Stern', Liszt snubbed the French contingent led by Berlioz and nearly caused a riot. The banquet was disrupted by the behaviour of Lola Montez, who danced on a table and embarrassed Liszt by insisting she was his guest at the celebrations and demanding a seat appropriate to her claimed status, thus upsetting a pre-organised seating arrangement." #NT!

The expression in it is true, the intonation right, the style sublime and new, the form well conceived and dutifully executed, the instrumentation remarkable for its vigor and variety. There is never a succession of the same sounds in his orchestra, which makes certain works, once prized, so tiresome for the listener; he knows how to use the small and large means, he demands neither the instruments nor the voices too much; in a word, he showed in one fell swoop that he had style in instrumentation and in the other parts of the musical art, since one feared he hadn't found it yet.' - Hector Berlioz" #NT!

As soon as I resolved to undertake it, I had to settle for writing myself most of the libretto as well; the fragments of the French translation of Goethe’s Faust by Gérard de Nerval, which I had already set to music twenty years before, and which I intended to include in the new score in a revised version, and two or three other scenes which had been written before my departure from Paris by M. Gandonnière following my instructions, did not add up to one-sixth of the entire work. During the journey in the old German stage-coach, I therefore tried to write the verses intended for my music. I started with Faust’s invocation to nature, without attempting to translate or even imitate Goethe’s masterpiece, but only to draw inspiration from it and to extract the musical substance that it contained. Once I had started I wrote the remaining verses as the musical ideas came to me, and I composed the score with an ease that I have rarely experienced with my other works.' - Hector Berlioz" #NT!

 elgar.121.f: "The New German School is a term introduced in 1859 by Franz Brendel, editor of the Neue Zeitung für Musik, to describe certain trends in German music. It has been used by different persons at different times with different meanings. It is generally agreed that Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner were among the most prominent representatives of the 'New German School'. There is also a consensus that Johannes Brahms did not take part. Beyond this, interpretations differ. The new term should be understood as denoting the whole period since Beethoven's death. According to Brendel, it was common usage to call the period of J.S. Bach and Handel 'Old German School'. The subsequent period was that of Viennese masters such as Mozart who had been influenced by the Italian style. Beethoven had redirected interest to the German North again and with this had opened the 'Neudeutsche Schule'. Composers from both sides looked back on Beethoven as their spiritual and artistic hero; the conservatives seeing him as an unsurpassable peak, the progressives as a new beginning in music." #NT!

The New Magazine for Music became the organ of the association. At the end of the 19th century, the ADMV was under the protectorate of the Grand Duke of Weimar. The ADMV has held a number of large Tonkunstler gatherings. It mostly oriented itself to the direction of the New German School represented by Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. As part of the artistic aims of the ADMV, annual Tonkünstler meetings at different locations were to be arranged, with performances of important, rarely heard, and especially new musical works of all kinds.

Musical structure, the limits of chromatic harmony, and program music versus absolute music were the principal areas of contention. The opposing parties crystallized during the 1850s. The most prominent members of the conservative circle were Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim, Clara Schumann, and the Leipzig Conservatoire, which had been founded by Felix Mendelssohn. Their opponents, the radical progressives mainly from Weimar, were represented by Franz Liszt and the members of the so-called New German School (German: Neudeutsche Schule), and by Richard Wagner. The controversy was German and Central European in origin; musicians from France, Italy, and Russia were only marginally involved.

This was an outgrowth of the debate on the viability of the symphony genre, which had grown in the hands of Ludwig van Beethoven from one intended for entertainment to a form that included social, moral and cultural ideals. Liszt and his circle favored new styles in writing and forms that would blend music with narrative and pictorial ideas. Toward this end Liszt developed the symphonic poem. The Leipzig/Berlin school championed the forms used by the classic masters, forms codified by musicologists such as Adolf Bernhard Marx of the early 19th century. The validity of program music was also a point of contention. In his 1854 book, Vom Musikalisch-Schönen, Hanslick stated that music did not and could not represent anything specific other than itself. \n\n In the end, #G [GetGlobalVariable('elgar_neudeutsch_yes').GetValue]#!

 elgar.131.f: "Franz Liszt was an Austro-Hungarian composer, pianist, conductor, theater director, music teacher. Liszt was one of the most prominent and influential piano virtuosos and, with an oeuvre of over 1300 works and arrangements, one of the most productive composers of the 19th century. Although a large part of his oeuvre can be assigned to the piano literature, Liszt also gave a clear impetus to orchestral music with the development of the symphonic poem. His concept of program music and the use of new harmonic and formal means made him - along with Richard Wagner - the best-known protagonist of the New German School. Liszt began an extensive tour of Europe in 1839, which he continued for the next eight years. This period was Liszt's most brilliant as a concert pianist and he received many honors and much adulation during his tours. During this period, the first reports of intense responses from Liszt's fans appeared, which became referred to as Lisztomania. Lisztomania was characterized by a hysterical reaction to Liszt and his concerts. Liszt's playing was reported to raise the mood of the audience to a level of mystical ecstasy." #NT!

Moreover, his great fame as a pianist, which he would continue to enjoy long after he had officially retired from the concert stage, was based mainly on his accomplishments during this time. Adding to his reputation was that Liszt gave away much of the proceeds of his work to charity and humanitarian causes. He donated large sums to the building fund of Cologne Cathedral, and St. Stephen's Basilica in Pest, and made private donations to public services such as hospitals and schools, as well as charitable organizations such as the Leipzig Musicians Pension Fund. After the Great Fire of Hamburg in May 1842, he gave concerts in aid of those left homeless. In order to satisfy his admirers' need for a lock of his hair, Liszt acquired a dog whose fur served unnoticed as a source of curls." #NT!

Yet I was mistaken, after all, and I did not notice it until last week, at the Italian Opera House, where Liszt gave his first concert...This was truly no Germanically sentimental, sentimentalizing Berlinate audience, before which Liszt played, quite alone, or rather, accompanied solely by his genius.

His 24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1 are among the best known of his compositions and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the last rites. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused. A week later, on May 27, 1840, the 57-year-old Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa. This has led to a public discussion about how to deal with Paganini.

The best-known number from the opera is the 'Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves', a chorus that is regularly given an encore in many opera houses when performed today. Nabucco is the opera that is considered to have permanently established Verdi's reputation as a composer. He commented that 'this is the opera with which my artistic career really begins. And though I had many difficulties to fight against, it is certain that Nabucco was born under a lucky star.'

Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, commissioned Verdi to write the opera, paying him 150,000 francs, but the premiere was delayed. Aida met with great acclaim when it finally opened in Cairo. The costumes and accessories for the premiere were designed by Auguste Mariette, and he oversaw the design and construction of the sets, which were created in Paris and shipped to Cairo. Although Verdi did not attend the premiere in Cairo, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public.

Its elaboration is of chamber music perfection, for the instrumentation is smaller than that of any other symphony, and its proportions are finely tuned to one another. It can be understood as Schubert's productive examination of Mozart's symphonic works and reveals Schubert's complete otherness and independence. According to Schubert's own entries on the score, the work was composed between September and October 3, 1816; it was written at a time when Schubert was looking for his own musical language. The first performance of Schubert's 5th symphony took place with a small amateur orchestra in Vienna in 1816; the first public performance, on the other hand, only took place on October 17, 1841, thirteen years after Schubert's death, under the baton of Michael Leitermayer." #NT!

A whole series of famous Donizetti operas were written in Naples, which consolidated the position of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies as a top-ranking music location. But despite the many successes, Donizetti had to fight again and again with the Neapolitan censorship, which defaced his libretti or canceled entire operas. In the most recent dispute, the king himself intervened to prevent the performance of the opera 'Poliuto'. After many years of quarrels with the censorship, Donizetti has grown weary and has made preparations to flee to Paris.

It reflected the life of the early Christian martyr Saint Polyeuctus. Regarded by one author as Donizetti's "most personal opera" with the music being "some of the finest Donizetti was to compose", Poliuto was written in 1838 for performances planned at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples later that year. However, close to the time for rehearsals to begin, King Ferdinand II refused to allow the martyrdom of a Christian saint to be seen on stage and forbade the production. Angry at the decision and with a commission for the Paris Opéra due from the composer, Donizetti paid the penalty to the San Carlo for not producing an original work as a substitute, and left Naples for Paris. As his first commission for Paris, he decided to revise Poliuto and between 1839-40 a French text, with the title Les Martyres." #NT!

Friends including his brother-in-law, Antonio Vasselli (known as Totò) - continually attempted to persuade him to take up an academic position in Bologna rather than the Vienna court engagement, if for no other reason that it would give the composer a base from which to work and teach and not be continually exhausting himself with travel between cities. Donizetti reported the public's reaction: 'The enthusiasm is impossible to describe. Even at the final rehearsal, which Rossini attended, in the middle of the day, he was accompanied to his home to the shouting of more than 500 persons. The same thing the first night, under his window, since he did not appear in the hall.'" #NT!

 elgar.513.d: "Donizetti's increasingly rapid mental decline led to him being committed to an insane asylum in Paris." #NT!
 elgar.513.f: "Donizetti reported in his letters over a long period of time, starting in the 1820s, about headaches, sometimes fever attacks that lasted only one day and also about occasional depressive moods. The extraordinary amount of work that he accomplished throughout his life, as well as the long journeys that were particularly strenuous at the time, especially after he moved to Paris and later to Vienna, led to increased symptoms of exhaustion from 1842 to 1843. The occasional headache and fever attacks were accompanied by dizziness and sometimes 'sensations in the head'. In 1845 Donizetti's health deteriorated rapidly and he collapsed on the street in Paris. The doctors forbade him to compose - which depressed him even more. Finally, under false pretenses, he was lured into the insane asylum at Ivry-sur-Seine without his knowledge and against his will, and was forcibly interned there. The ailing composer quickly saw through his predicament as a 'prisoner' and classification as a 'maniac' and wrote desperate and heartbreaking letters to friends and relatives asking for help." #NT!

A planned departure was prevented by doctors, but also by the police prefect of Paris for inscrutable reasons. Only with the help of diplomatic pressure could the now completely apathetic composer be brought back by his brother Francesco and his nephew Andrea. The daughter of Baroness Rosa Rota-Basoni played the piano for the composer every day and sang arias from his works, his friend Dolci spoke to him in the Bergamasque dialect and he received a visit from the tenor Rubini, but Donizetti showed no more reactions. Donizetti died a week after an apoplectic stroke with hemiplegia, high fever and subsequent infections. Autopsy results showed symptoms of 'past' meningitis and a partially damaged, inflamed spinal cord." #NT!

On doctor's orders, he was to experience a several-month cure in his hometown of Bergamo under the best possible circumstances. The return to country life, freedom from stress and pressure, and returning to his roots has borne fruit after many months. Donizetti, apathetic for weeks, responded to one of his own arias, sung by Giovanna, daughter of Baroness Rosa Rota-Basoni. Talking to family members in the local dialect also showed progress day by day. After years of therapy, the once terminally ill composer seems to have been brought back to life." #NT!

 elgar.516.f: "In the winter of 1835/36 Sigismund Thalberg made his debut in a private concert given by the secretary of the Austrian embassy in Paris. He was greeted enthusiastically by the artists present, including Rossini and Meyerbeer, and praised as the inventor of a new style of piano. While Franz Liszt's concerts in Lyon brought in around 500-600 francs, Thalberg earned 10,000 francs from a single concert at the Italian Theater. Before Thalberg appeared on his second stay in Paris, Liszt published a review riddled with insinuations and polemics. According to Liszt, Thalberg's success came about solely through propaganda. Thalberg appeared again in Paris from February 1837 and was celebrated again. On March 31, both artists performed at a charity event organized by Princess Belgiojoso." #NT!

His last tone poem, 'From the cradle to the grave' therefore differed from all his predecessors. Liszt was inspired by a drawing by the Hungarian painter Mihály Zichy. Large sections of the work do not require a powerful orchestra, especially the beginning sounds like chamber music; many islands of sound are formed in which the musical material is poor, and solo passages are not uncommon, especially at the end of the movements. The harmonics used are also a harbinger of times to come. During his lifetime, however, music critics rated the work as the 'mistake of an old man'." #NT!

 elgar.518.f: "Lohengrin is a romantic opera in three acts by the German composer Richard Wagner. With Lohengrin, Wagner created the new operatic form of through-composed musical drama. The composition is not divided into individual numbers, but is played through act by act without interruption. Wagner thus sets himself apart from the conventional structure of number operas with arias, recitatives and choral parts. In order to be able to translate the inner life of the stage characters into clearly legible musical motifs, Wagner used leitmotifs (e.g. the Grail motif and the question ban motif). The opera has inspired other works of art. King Ludwig II of Bavaria named his castle Neuschwanstein Castle after the Swan Knight." #NT!

 elgar.519.f: "The 'Artwork of the Future' is an art-theoretical writings by Richard Wagner that he wrote between 1849 and 1852 in Zurich. As in his writing 'Art and the Revolution', Wagner laments the decay of the arts and develops his model of the new unity of the arts, the 'Gesamtkunstwerk'. As in his previous writings, Wagner developed his conviction that Greek art was embedded in Greek religion and mysticism and that, through the destruction of religion, art was also loosing its cohesion and becoming 'individual arts' (drama, music and dance) had to degenerate. He complains that the art of music as a pure accompaniment to the word has withered away. In the further course of hisexplanations he goes into great detail on the development of the different arts, from the ideal state during antiquity to the decadence of his time. In his next and most important written work, Opera and Drama, Richard Wagner then explains very precisely (and very theoretically) how he imagines the optimal 'union' of music and poetry. A little later he set to work on the 'practical' execution and wrote and composed his 'Ring des Nibelungen' as the music drama par excellence after years of work." #NT!

 elgar.520.d: "Tristan und Isolde is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner to a German libretto by the composer, based largely on the 12th-century romance Tristan and Iseult by Gottfried von Strassburg. The opera was enormously influential among Western classical composers and provided direct inspiration to composers such as Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and Benjamin Britten. Other composers like Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky formulated their styles in contrast to Wagner's musical legacy. Many see Tristan as a milestone on the move away from common practice harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century." #NT!
 elgar.520.f: "'The work that has always aroused my greatest admiration is Tristan. A shuddering astonishment seizes me in front of this gigantic building, and it still seems incredible to me how a human being could conceive and realize it.

Wagner himself conceived and promoted the idea of a special festival to showcase his own works, in particular his monumental cycle 'Der Ring des Nibelungen' and 'Parsifal'. Performances take place in a specially designed theatre, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. Wagner personally supervised the design and construction of the theatre, which contained many architectural innovations to accommodate the huge orchestras for which Wagner wrote as well as the composer's particular vision about the staging of his works. The Festival has become a pilgrimage destination for Wagnerians and classical-music enthusiasts. Present at this unique musical event were Kaiser Wilhelm, Dom Pedro II of Brazil, King Ludwig, and other members of the nobility, as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and such accomplished composers as Anton Bruckner, Edvard Grieg, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Franz Liszt, and the young Arthur Foote." #NT!

 elgar.523.f: "Wagner has always had a difficult time in Paris, not only because of his competition with the popular Giacomo Meyerbeer. In order to accommodate his opera Tannhäuser at the Grand Opera, he had to bow to French customs - such as the installation of a ballet. But Wagner vehemently resisted the specifications and only included a bacchanal. At the same time, Wagner made himself unpopular with the musicians with agonizingly long rehearsals. The premiere caused a scandal: the gentlemen of the Paris 'Jockey Club' felt betrayed when the ballet didn't appear after the overture. The gentlemen didn't come because of the music, but to watch the beautiful women and to visit them later in the changing room. Since they didn't get what they wanted, they sabotaged the event with whistles and shouts. The next day was no better: the Parisian press teared the performance up in the air. Not only France, but also Wagner's friends and enemies in Germany will be watching our reaction closely." #NT!

 elgar.524.d: "Edvard Grieg's Holberg Suite, which premiered in Oslo, has not only turned out to be a musical masterpiece, but has also inspired Norwegian national sentiment." #NT!
 elgar.524.f: "The Holberg Suite, subtitled 'Suite in olden style', is a suite of five movements based on eighteenth-century dance forms, written by Edvard Grieg in 1884 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Dano-Norwegian humanist playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754). It exemplifies nineteenth-century music which makes use of musical styles and forms from the preceding century. The Holberg Suite was originally composed for the piano, but a year later was adapted by Grieg himself for string orchestra. The suite consists of an introduction and a set of dances. It is an early essay in neoclassicism, an attempt to echo as much as was known in Grieg's time of the music of Holberg's era. Although not as famous as Grieg's incidental music from Peer Gynt, which is itself usually performed as arranged in a pair of suites, many critics regard the works as of equal merit." #NT!

More than 10 years after the cantata Rinaldo op. 50 and the Alto Rhapsody op. 53, Brahms again used a text by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. According to Max Kalbeck, Brahms was inspired to compose by the actress Charlotte Wolter, who appeared in the role of Iphigenia at the Burgtheater in Vienna. On June 13, 1896, Brahms wrote about the piece: 'I often hear philosophizing about the sixth verse of the Parzenlied. I think the heart of the unsuspecting listener should grow soft and the eye wet at the mere entrance of the major; only then does the misery of mankind seize him.'" #NT!

The father wanted his son to be the successor in the company, but the son paid little attention to business in Europe and was more interested in art and music. Therefore, Delius jr. transferred to an orange plantation in Florida to keep him away from the influences of the European metropolises. However, it was this transfer that was to be of outstanding importance for his later musical creativity. In Jacksonville, Delius met the Catholic organist Thomas Ward, who Delius says was the only one who actually taught him anything.

In the beginning, of course, only his frenetic unpopularity made him popular. Carried by the favor of hate, carefully illuminated by envy, that eternally sleepless and powerful protector of all that is real, by ridicule, by envy and slander, proclaimed by the loudest sound carriers on every street corner, he has become famous. […] And so it was heard every day that he mistreats his musicians, whips them into inhuman work, almost incites them to death, and that if they were only able, they would all like to drown him in a spoonful of water. It was said that he shortened his singers, drilled them like recruits, played with them like the Great Turk with his slaves.

Commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, the ballet was written to a scenario by Russian poet Sergey Gorodetsky. But when Diaghilev rejected the score even before its completion, the composer reworked the music into a suite for concert performance. The performance became the biggest scandal in the history of Prokofiev's premieres. The director of the Conservatory at the time, Alexander Glazunov, left the hall during the concert, the majority of the audience was outraged and the reviews were devastating.

Although criticized regarding his poor conductor skills and scoffed because of his 'creative decay', Schumann composed his last symphony, the 'Rhenish'. He used Beethoven's and Mendelssohn's symphonies as a model, but was also inspired by his impressions of the Rhineland. Schumann himself stated that his journey to Cologne and the sight of the cathedral were his main inspiration for this composition, which became one of his most famous works." #NT!

Tones, chords, entire musical pieces raged in his head and robbed him of sleep. Meanwhile, Schumann was watched day and night by his wife and children and was already under medical supervision, but was still able to leave the apartment on February 27, 1854 at an unobserved moment. He headed for the nearby pontoon bridge, climbed over the railing and, after throwing his wedding ring into the water, threw himself into the river. He was rescued by the bridge master and other unknown men, taken home and looked after by a doctor who was summoned. After his suicide attempt, he wished to be admitted to the institution for the treatment and care of mentally ill and insane people in Endenich near Bonn, which was opened in 1844 by the psychiatrist Franz Richarz." #NT!

Schumann was doing so well that he was able to play music on the square piano with Brahms and accompany him part of the way to the Bonn train station under the supervision of a guard. On April 10, 1856, Brahms found Schumann in a precarious condition. Schumann could no longer speak intelligibly. On May 1, 1856, it was last mentioned in the medical records that Schumann played the piano. Most of the time he could hardly express himself intelligibly. Clara Schumann's plan from April 1856 to bring Schumann to Düsseldorf and look after him there herself was not realized. From mid-July 1856, Schumann ate less and less.

In order to dispel this delusion, Peters asked Clara Schumann for a letter to her husband. This led to the first exchange of letters since the admission. From now on, Schumann again took an active part in life outside the institution. He also corresponded with his children, Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim and with publishers. Between September 1854 and May 1855 he wrote around 25 letters. During this time, Schumann often expressed his wish to be able to leave Endenich again. He played the piano every now and then. He studied compositions by Brahms. On January 11, 1855 he had his first visit from Johannes Brahms. From then on, Schumann's condition steadily improved until the doctors allowed Clara Schumann to visit.

Nevertheless, Rossini was still a highly respected figure and one of Italy's most beloved composers. A main reason why Rossini moved back to Paris - after an interlude in Florence - was probably not least due to his health.

In 1865 Liszt underwent tonsure and received the four minor orders. From then on, as a cleric, he wore the Roman collar and was addressed as an abbe. In 1886 Liszt attended the Wagner Festival. At the time of the trip, Liszt was already seriously ill and died a few days after his arrival on July 31, 1886 as a result of pneumonia. Bernhard Schnappauf, doctor and friend of Richard Wagner, spent the last few days on his deathbed and reported that Liszt died quietly and with dignity.

A woman comes by and says to another: 'Now he's in peace inside. Everything was too small for him.' The church in Grinzing is small, the churchyard narrow. And a spectacle for the Viennese is imminent. The church and cemetery will be cordoned off. Only cards will give access. We learn that Franz Schalk, Gregor, and the board of directors have requested that the opera be closed on the day of the funeral. No word on that. The court, the municipality of Vienna, does not move. And then the celebration. We are standing in front of the church when the coffin is carried out. It's raining. We get to the grave more quickly via a vineyard path. The procession arrives. The rain stops. A nightingale sings, the clods fall. A rainbow. And the hundreds are silent.' - Paul Stefan" #NT!

 elgar.701.d: "To mark the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution, Hector Berlioz composed a piece that attracted great public admiration." #NT!
 elgar.701.f: "The French government commissioned the symphony for the celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution which had brought Louis-Philippe I to power, for which it was erecting the July Column in the Place de la Bastille. Berlioz had little sympathy for the régime, but welcomed the opportunity to write the work because the government had offered him 10,000 francs for it. The Symphonie militaire (later renamed Symphonie funèbre et triomphale), rather than following the model Berlioz had established in Romeo and Juliet, represents a reversion to an earlier pre-Beethovenian style in the tradition of monumental French public ceremonial music. Berlioz revised the score in January 1842, adding an optional part for strings and a final chorus to a text by Antony Deschamps. Richard Wagner attended a performance of this new version at the Salle Vivienne on 1 February 1842. On 5 February, he told Robert Schumann that he found passages in the last movement of Berlioz's symphony so 'magnificent and sublime that they can never be surpassed.'" #NT!
 elgar.702.t: "Liszt in Weimar" #NT!
 elgar.702.d: "After many years of concert tours, the piano virtuoso and composer Franz Liszt is considering settling in Weimar." #NT!
 elgar.702.f: "The Weimar years were Franz Liszt's most artistically productive period. He wrote many of his piano works in Weimar, such as the Piano Sonata in B minor, the Harmonies poétiques et religieuses cycle, fifteen Hungarian Rhapsodies, as well as numerous transcriptions, piano reductions and revisions of earlier piano works, such as the Paganini Etudes. Two of his previously conceived piano concertos also received their final form here. In Weimar, Liszt conducted many works by contemporary composers, some of whom were controversial at the time, and also performed their operas. He conducted works by Richard Wagner, who was particularly close to him and whom he helped to flee to Zurich in the spring of 1849 after the Dresden uprising. In the years that followed, he supported Wagner financially as well as morally and maintained a lively correspondence with him. Later, Liszt and Wagner often appeared together as conductors. From 1865, after Wagner had a relationship with Liszt's daughter Cosima, the relationship cooled off for a long time." #NT!

 elgar.703.f: "'No subsequent experience has given me feelings even remotely similar to those I had on this day of the first performance of Rienzi. The only too well-founded anxiety as to their success has so dominated my feelings at all subsequent first performances of my works that I could never really enjoy them or take much notice of the way the audience was behaving. [...] The initial success of Rienzi was no doubt assured beforehand. But the uproarious way in which the public declared its partiality for me was extraordinary ... The public had been forcibly predisposed to accept it, because everyone connected with the theatre had been spreading such favourable reports ... that the entire population was looking forward to what was heralded as a miracle ... In trying to recall my condition that evening, I can remember it only as possessing all the features of a dream.' - Richard Wagner" #NT!

 elgar.704.d: "A piano concerto by Edvard Grieg celebrated its world premiere today in Copenhagen. It is already foreseeable that this will be one of his most popular pieces." #NT!
 elgar.704.f: "The Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 16, composed by Edvard Grieg in 1868, was the only concerto Grieg completed. The work is among Grieg's earliest important works, written by the 24-year-old composer in 1868 in Søllerød, Denmark, during one of his visits there to benefit from the climate. Grieg's concerto provides evidence of his interest in Norwegian folk music; the opening flourish is based on the motif of a falling minor second followed by a falling major third, which is typical of the folk music of Grieg's native country. The work was premiered by Edmund Neupert on 3 April 1869, in Copenhagen, with Holger Simon Paulli conducting. Some sources say that Grieg himself, an excellent pianist, was the intended soloist, but he was unable to attend the premiere owing to commitments with an orchestra in Christiania (now Oslo). Among those who did attend the premiere were the Danish composer Niels Gade and the Russian pianist Anton Rubinstein, who provided his piano for the occasion. Grieg revised the work at least seven times, usually in subtle ways, but the revisions amounted to over 300 differences from the original orchestration." #NT!

 elgar.705.f: "The Variations on a Theme by Haydn op. 56a is a variation work for orchestra by Johannes Brahms. The work was created in the summer of 1873 in Tutzing. The premiere took place on November 2, 1873 in Vienna under Brahms' direction. The piece falls into an epoch in which Brahms wanted to celebrate his stay in Vienna. On the one hand he left Detmold and Hamburg disappointed years ago. On the other hand, he strived to live where his great classical role models had lived and to continue the Viennese tradition." #NT!

Hoffmann's fantasies could imagine; he kindly asked me about my musical ability and knowledge - to which I replied, to his evident satisfaction with a mixture of shyness and self-confidence - and left me in a sort of dazed and shaken state.

 elgar.707.d: "After many setbacks, the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff has made an impressive return: his Second Piano Concerto caused frenetic applause." #NT!
 elgar.707.f: "After the disastrous 1897 premiere of his First Symphony, Rachmaninoff suffered a psychological breakdown that prevented composition for three years. Although depression sapped his energy, he still engaged in performance. Conducting and piano lessons became necessary to ease his financial position. In 1899, he was supposed to perform the Second Piano Concerto in London, which he had not composed yet due to illness, and instead made a successful conducting debut. Relatives decided to introduce him to the neurologist Nikolai Dahl, whom he visited daily from January to April 1900, which helped restore his health and confidence in composition. Rachmaninoff dedicated the concerto to Dahl for successfully treating him. After he fulfilled his 1908 London concert engagement at the Queen's Hall under Serge Koussevitzky  a flattering review by The Times emerged: 'The direct expression of the work, the extraordinary precision and exactitude of Rachmaninoff's playing, and even the strict economy of movement of arms and hands which he exercises, all contributed to the impression of completeness of performance.'" #NT!

I thought it might be a complete debacle, but nothing happened and in any case the parts has so many mistakes in them that the session turned mainly into one for making corrections. In Kislovodsk, I had worried that there would be some antagonism from a 'Revolutionary Orchestra' playing my new works, but the opposite was the case: the State Orchestra, infused with much new young blood, was flexible and attentive, and played the Symphony with evident enjoyment.' - Sergei Prokofiev" #NT!

 elgar.709.d: "Pyotr Tchaikovsky, an aspiring young composer, has presented his overture Romeo and Juliet. The audience received the work with mixed feelings." #NT!
 elgar.709.f: "Not only at the beginning, but throughout his entire career, Tchaikovsky had to assert himself against critics and competitors. The overture Romeo and Juliet, for example, was intended to be a failure when it was published. On the other hand, this criticism, which Tchaikovsky repeatedly received throughout his life, led the composer to overcritically edit this and other works; Tchaikovsky remained one of the greatest critics of his own work throughout his career. It was also not without irony that the national Russian-minded composers praised precisely this work, even though they would later be among Tchaikovsky's harshest critics. Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky was to become one of the most important Russian composers from this period at the latest and, in just a few years, to achieve international fame that hardly any other musician of the century achieved." #NT!

 elgar.710.d: "With the creation of the Italian National State and the addition of the opera city of Milan to our territory, we have the unique opportunity to engage one of the most important figures in Italian musical history: Giuseppe Verdi." #NT!
 elgar.710.f: "Giuseppe Verdi was an Italian composer and politician, universally recognized as one of the greatest opera artists and composers of all time, together with other protagonists of nineteenth-century Italian musical theater: Gioachino Rossini, Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti. He sympathized with the Risorgimento movement which pursued the unification of Italy and actively participated for a short time in political life; over the course of his long existence he established a unique position among his compatriots, becoming a profound artistic symbol of the country's unity. It was for this reason that a month after his death, a solemn and endless procession crossed Milan, accompanying his remains with the notes of 'Va, pensiero' from Nabucco, written by him 60 years earlier, effectively expressing the feelings of Italians towards their missing hero. This demonstrated the extent to which Verdi's music had been assimilated into the national consciousness. His works still remain among the best known and performed in theaters around the world, in particular Aida (1871), the aforementioned Nabucco (1842) and the so-called 'Verdi triad': Rigoletto (1851), Il Trovatore (1853) and La traviata (1853)." #NT!

 elgar.711.d: "Robert Schumann's First Symphony was performed today under the direction of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. Schumann is married to the important pianist Clara (née Wieck) and has so far attracted attention more as a music critic than as a composer. Opinions differ about his pieces for piano." #NT!
 elgar.711.f: "With the exception of Franz Schubert, no German-speaking composer was as misjudged during his lifetime as Robert Schumann. While Schubert's importance was only recognized after his early death, Schumann was accused of starting as a genius and ending as a talent. Contemporaries often had no access to his work or simply did not understand his works. His piano pieces, which make up part of his fame today, were mostly unknown at the time. Mockers only saw him as the man at the side of the pianist Clara Schumann. In his native Saxony he stood in the shadow of Mendelssohn. Wagner later opposed him, while Brahms became a close confidant of Clara and Robert. Liszt saw Schumann as a pioneer of musical progress in Germany, but had no success with audiences when he included Schumann's works in his repertoire. Hopes of a permanent position at an important musical institution were repeatedly dashed. Similar to Schubert, Schumann also met a premature, tragic end." #NT!

 elgar.712.d: "Edward Elgar has distinguished himself in recent years with his cantatas and choral works. 'Scenes from the Saga of King Olaf', his most recent work, was well received by audiences." #NT!
 elgar.712.f: "In the 1890s, Edward Elgar built up a growing reputation as a major British composer. Initially strongly influenced by continental influence - 'King Olaf' also shows echoes of the Wganer style - he gradually found his own sound language, which would encourage later British composers to take completely new paths. Elgar felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. Nevertheless, Elgar can be considered the most important British composer since Henry Purcell." #NT!

He had previously been denied this honor for political reasons. There are now increasing voices to offer the position to the son of the composer who died early." #NT!
 elgar.713.f: "Johann Strauss was an Austrian-German bandmaster and composer and was internationally recognized as the 'Waltz King'. He had already composed his first waltz at the age of six and had secretly taken violin lessons because his father had planned a career as a civil servant. Because the latter had broken with the family, his mother supported his musical training against his will. His first appearance at the Casino Dommayer, an entertainment venue known throughout the region, was a huge success. Tours initially took him through the Danube Monarchy with his own orchestra (which increased his rivalry with his father). After his father's death, he took over his orchestra and merged it with his. Because he had composed some works for the revolutionaries of 1848 and thus showed sympathy for the insurrectionary movement, he attracted the attention of the censorship authorities and fell out of favor at court despite his popularity. As a result, he was denied the position of court ball music director until 1863." #NT!

 elgar.714.f: "Antonín Dvořák was a Czech composer, who frequently employed rhythms and other aspects of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia. Dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt violin student from age six. In 1874, he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two symphonies and other works. Although Dvořák was not aware of it, Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed. The prize was awarded to Dvořák in 1874 and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to him. Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock." #NT!

During this time he was already a pianist in the household of Nadezhda von Meck, Tchaikovsky's patron. In 1884 Debussy won the Prix de Rome, but was unambitious during his stay in Rome. He found Italian opera boring and had little use for the prevailing style of Giuseppe Verdi. He traveled back to Paris early and lived an unstable life there: 'I am sure the Institute would not approve, for, naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one. But there is no help for it! I am too enamoured of my freedom, too fond of my own ideas!'" #NT!

The opera is one of the most famous of its genre and, along with L'elisir d'amore and Lucia di Lammermoor, is one of the few works by Donizetti that has had an almost continuous performance tradition since the 19th century. Based on the comedies of Carlo Goldoni, the characters are more or less closely based on types of the commedia dell'arte, but are given sentimental traits, i. H. through the ability to feel and express sadness, pain or remorse, a differentiation that goes beyond their type. Don Pasquale was an instant hit, such as only Bellini's I puritani (1835) had previously had in Paris." #NT!

 elgar.1012.t: "Dom Sébastien" #NT!
 elgar.1012.f: "Dom Sébastien is a French grand opera in five acts by Gaetano Donizetti.  It is a historic-fiction about King Sebastian of Portugal (1554-1578) and his ill-fated 1578 expedition to Morocco. At the time, Donizetti was attempting to compose an opera competitive with similar historical operas by Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy and Giacomo Meyerbeer. One critical description of the nature of Dom Sébastien is 'a funeral in five acts'. The work was received with reluctance, which Donizetti himself felt was a fiasco. Although Donizetti considered his last opera to be one of his most important works, Dom Sébastien is largely forgotten today. It was written at a time when Donizetti 'no longer had unrestricted control over his imagination', so the opera was already marked by Donizetti's incipient illness." #NT!

 elgar.1021.f: "Les Troyens is a French grand opera in five acts by Hector Berlioz. The libretto was written by Berlioz himself from Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid; the score was composed between 1856 and 1858. Les Troyens is Berlioz's most ambitious work, the summation of his entire artistic career, but he did not live to see it performed in its entirety. Under the title Les Troyens à Carthage, the last three acts were premièred with many cuts by Léon Carvalho's company, the Théâtre Lyrique, at their theatre (now the Théâtre de la Ville) on the Place du Châtelet in Paris on 4 November 1863, with 21 repeat performances. After decades of neglect, today the opera is considered by some music critics as one of the finest ever written." #NT!

 elgar.1022.f: "La damnation de Faust is a work for four solo voices, full seven-part chorus, large children's chorus and orchestra by the French composer Hector Berlioz. He called it a "légende dramatique" (dramatic legend). The French composer was inspired by a translation of Goethe's dramatic poem Faust and produced a musical work that, like the masterpiece on which it is based, defies easy categorisation. Conceived at various times as a free-form oratorio and as an opera its travelogue form and cosmic perspective have made it an extreme challenge to stage as an opera. Berlioz himself was eager to see the work staged, but once he did, he conceded that the production techniques of his time were not up to the task of bringing the work to dramatic life. Most of the work's fame has come through concert performances." #NT!

 elgar.1023.f: "'This Traité d'Instrumentation is a highly paradoxical work. It begins with a preface of several lines unrelated to the subject, in which the author takes a stand against musicians who abuse modulations and whose penchant for dissonance matches the taste that certain animals have for salty plants and thorny bushes. Then he turns to the orchestral instruments and mixes strange assertions with the most solid truths and valuable advice.[...] In his treatise, as in his orchestration, Berlioz, for all its oddities, is simply fabulous. To him my generation owes its education, and I dare say a good one. Berlioz possessed the invaluable gift of igniting the imagination and arousing love for the art he taught.[...] These seemingly superfluous musical examples made one dream, they opened the door to a new world, to a vast one and fascinating glimpse of the future, of the Promised Land.' - Camille Saint-Saëns" #NT!
 elgar.1031.t: "Les Préludes" #NT!
 elgar.1031.f: "Les Préludes is the third of Franz Liszt's thirteen symphonic poems. The music was composed between 1845-54, and began as an overture to Liszt's choral cycle Les quatre élémens (The Four Elements), then revised as a stand-alone concert overture, with a new title referring to a poem by Alphonse de Lamartine. Les préludes is the earliest example of an orchestral work entitled 'Symphonic Poem'. Liszt sees the phases of life as preludes to the melody of death. These phases of life are struggles and storms, love happiness and pain, consolation, experiencing nature. Despite the contrasts in these moods reflected in Les Préludes, the work is of great coherence. It begins with a melancholy melody, from which the first stormy main theme develops, which leads to the second theme via a pastoral part. These two themes are developed in glidingly changing moods. In a climax, the original theme flows into the first main theme as a majestic, glamorous fanfare." #NT!
 elgar.1032.t: "Hungarian Rhapsodies" #NT!
 elgar.1032.f: "The Hungarian Rhapsodies is a set of 19 piano pieces based on Hungarian folk themes, composed by Franz Liszt during 1846-1853, and later in 1882 and 1885. Liszt also arranged versions for orchestra, piano duet and piano trio. Some are better known than others, with Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 being particularly famous and No. 6, No. 10, No. 12 and No. 14 (especially as arranged for piano and orchestra as the Hungarian Fantasy) also being well known. Liszt incorporated many themes he had heard in his native western Hungary and which he believed to be folk music, though many were in fact tunes written by members of the Hungarian upper middle class, or by composers such as József Kossovits. In their original piano form, the Hungarian Rhapsodies are noted for their difficulty." #NT!
 elgar.1033.t: "Dante Symphony" #NT!
 elgar.1033.f: "The 'Dante Symphony' is a choral symphony composed by Franz Liszt. Written in the high romantic style, it is based on Dante Alighieri's journey through Hell and Purgatory, as depicted in The Divine Comedy. Some critics have argued that the Dante Symphony is not so much a symphony in the classical sense as it is two descriptive symphonic poems. Liszt's original intention was to compose the work in three movements: an Inferno, a Purgatorio and a Paradiso. The first two were to be purely instrumental, and the finale choral. Wagner, however, persuaded Liszt that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral Magnificat at the end of the second movement. Liszt scholar Humphrey Searle argues that while Liszt may have felt more at home portraying the infernal regions than the celestial ones, the task of portraying Paradise in music would not have been beyond his powers." #NT!
 elgar.1041.t: "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" #NT!
 elgar.1041.f: "'Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg' is a music drama, or opera, in three acts, by Richard Wagner. It is the longest opera commonly performed, taking nearly four and a half hours, not counting two breaks between acts, and is traditionally not cut. The Meistersinger of Nuremberg occupies a unique place in Wagner's oeuvre. It is the only comedy among his mature operas and is also unusual among his works in being set in a historically well-defined time and place rather than in a mythical or legendary setting. It is the only mature Wagner opera based on an entirely original story. It incorporates many of the operatic conventions that Wagner had railed against in his essays on the theory of opera: rhymed verse, arias, choruses, a quintet, and even a ballet." #NT!
 elgar.1042.t: "Die Walküre" #NT!
 elgar.1042.f: "'Die Walküre' forms together with the operas 'Das Rheingold', 'Siegfried' and 'Götterdämmerung' the complete work 'Der Ring des Nibelungen'. Wagner largely followed the principles related to the form of musical drama, reflecting the feelings and moods behind the work, using a system of recurring leitmotifs to represent people, ideas, and situations rather than the conventional operatic units of arias, ensembles, and choruses. The story of Die Walküre is based on the Norse mythology told in the Völsunga saga and the Poetic Edda." #NT!
 elgar.1043.t: "Parsifal" #NT!
 elgar.1043.f: "Richard Wagner's Parsifal contains religious elements such as sacred music, the unveiling of the monstrance (Grail), baptism and the Christian communion ritual. Already in his Zurich art writings, he developed the idea of using art to clarify the core of religion. Wagner explained that in order to transform his parable-like message of salvation and regeneration of mankind through compassion - represented by the searching Parsifal and the suffering Amfortas - he chose an art form which, with religious symbolism, was intended to have a 'rapturing effect on the mind'. Wagner himself described the three-act play as a stage consecration festival play and decreed that it should only be performed in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus." #NT!

 elgar.1051.f: "Peer Gynt, Op. 23, is the incidental music to Henrik Ibsen's 1867 play of the same name, written by the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. Although composing many short piano pieces and chamber works, the work Grieg did for Henrik Ibsen stood out. Originally composing 90 minutes of orchestral music for the play, he later went back and extracted certain sections for the suites. Peer Gynt's travels around the world and distant lands are represented by the instruments Grieg chooses to use. Grieg later created two suites from his Peer Gynt music. Some of the music from these suites has received coverage in popular culture, especially the pieces 'Morning Mood', 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' and 'Solveig's Song'." #NT!

 elgar.1052.f: "Lyric Pieces is a collection of 66 short pieces for solo piano written by Edvard Grieg. They were published in 10 volumes, from 1867 to 1901. The collection includes several of his best known pieces, such as Wedding Day at Troldhaugen, To Spring, March of the Trolls, and Butterfly. The theme of the first piece in the set, Arietta, was one of the composer's favorite melodies. In the words of pianist Andrei Gavrilow, the Lyric Pieces are 'a very special kind of diary that Grieg kept throughout his life, or a confession, because they reflect the most intimate moments in the composer's life'." #NT!
 elgar.1053.t: "Norwegian Dances" #NT!
 elgar.1053.f: "The Norwegian Dances were the Norwegian's answer to the hugely successful Slavonic Dances of Antonín Dvořák and the Hungarian Dances of Johannes Brahms. The two colleagues had published their dance series for piano four hands in 1878 and 1881 by the Simrock publishing house. At that time Grieg did not dare to orchestrate his dances, since the terrain was occupied by his friend Johan Svendsen's 'Norwegian Rhapsodies'. The orchestral version of his Norwegian Dances was therefore arranged by Robert Henriques - much to Grieg's satisfaction. For the first dance, Grieg used the popular Sinklar march, for the last three so-called "Hallings", traditional Norwegian bridal dances for young men, which are fast and very acrobatic to perform." #NT!

The deep seriousness, combined with all the magic of poetry, has a wonderful, shocking and soothing effect. As you know, I can never really put it into words, but I feel the whole rich treasure of this work to the core, and the enthusiasm that speaks from every piece moves me deeply, which is why I can't help myself pronounce … Oh, if I could hear it, what would I give for it.' - Clara Schuman" #NT!

They vary from about a minute to five minutes in length. They are among Brahms's most popular works and were the most profitable for him. Each dance has been arranged for a wide variety of instruments and ensembles. Brahms originally wrote the version for piano four hands and later arranged the first ten dances for solo piano. The violinist Joseph Joachim, who was a friend of Brahms, created a virtuoso arrangement of all Hungarian Dances for violin and piano." #NT!

 elgar.1063.f: "Symphony No. 4 is the last symphony written by Johannes Brahms. Today it is one of the composer's most popular and most frequently performed orchestral works. At first glance, the uncompromising way in which the work is designed was disconcerting. When Brahms and Ignaz Brüll played the symphony to friends on two pianos, Clara Schumann and Brahms' later biographer Max Kalbeck, among others, reacted with rejection. Eduard Hanslick is said to have exclaimed: 'Throughout the movement I felt as if I were being beaten through by two terribly clever people.' Elisabeth von Herzogenberg described the work as 'a small world for the clever and knowledgeable, in which the people who walk in the dark could only have a small part'. When Brahms attended a performance of the symphony in 1897, shortly before his death, he received thunderous applause from the Viennese audience, which the work has received to this day." #NT!

 elgar.1071.f: "Like some of Mahler's other symphonies, the 5th symphony was not understood after its premiere. In 1905, after an unsuccessful performance in Hamburg, Mahler complained: 'The Fifth is a cursed work. Nobody gets it.' Music reviews in the years following the premiere were mostly negative. The music critic Ferdinand Pfohl, for example, judged that the 5th symphony was one of Mahler's weaker works. Only the Neue Zeitung für Musik gave the symphony a benevolent testimony and spoke of an 'overwhelming wealth of beauty'. Especially in comparison to the 4th symphony written two years earlier, it represents a major difference in content and form. With the rougher sound world of the 5th symphony, Mahler begins a new creative phase, which is further developed in the following 6th symphony. Only after Mahler's death did the work become more and more appreciated." #NT!
 elgar.1072.t: "Lied von der Erde" #NT!
 elgar.1072.f: "'Is it really the same man who, 'in harmony with the infinite', erected the edifice of the Eighth that we now find in the drinking song of Earth's woes? Who creeps lonely in the autumn to his beloved resting place, longing for refreshment? Who looks at youth with a friendly look of old age, with gentle emotion at beauty? Who seeks to forget the meaningless earthly existence in drunkenness and finally says goodbye in melancholy? […] It is hardly the same person and composer. All works up to that point had arisen from the feeling of life [...] The earth is disappearing, a different air is blowing in, a different light shines over it. [...] When I brought the autograph back to him, almost unable to say a word about it, he opened the 'Abschied' and said, 'What do you think? Is that bearable at all? Won't people kill themselves afterwards?' He then pointed to the rhythmic difficulties and asked jokingly, 'Any idea how to conduct that? Not me!' - Bruno Walter" #NT!

 elgar.1073.f: "'I can well understand that one composes such terrible lyrics when one has no children or when one has lost children. But I can't understand how you can sing about the death of children if you hugged and kissed them half an hour before, happy and healthy!' - Alma Mahler-Werfel, wife of Gustav Mahler" #NT!
 elgar.1081.t: "Piano Concerto No. 3" #NT!
 elgar.1081.f: "At that time Mahler was the only conductor whom I considered worthy to be classed with Nikisch. He devoted himself to the concerto until the accompaniment, which is rather complicated, had been practiced to perfection, although he had already gone through another long rehearsal. According to Mahler, every detail of the score was important - an attitude too rare amongst conductors. ... Though the rehearsal was scheduled to end at 12:30, we played and played, far beyond this hour, and when Mahler announced that the first movement would be rehearsed again, I expected some protest or scene from the musicians, but I did not notice a single sign of annoyance. The orchestra played the first movement with a keen or perhaps even closer appreciation than the previous time. - Sergei Rachmaninoff" #NT!
 elgar.1082.t: "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" #NT!
 elgar.1082.f: "The piece consists of 24 variations on a theme that Niccolò Paganini himself used as the starting point for a series of variations. This melody has repeatedly served as a template for various composers, including Johannes Brahms and Franz Liszt. In some variations, Rachmaninoff uses another, much older melody: the sequence 'Dies irae', once an integral part of the Latin mass for the dead. Rachmaninoff used this theme again and again in his works. It appears in all the symphonies, the Symphonic Dances, the symphonic poem Die Toteninsel and the first piano sonata. The combination of a Paganini theme with the 'Dies irae' prompts the search for a programmatic background to the work. According to legend, the great violinist sold his soul to the devil in order to achieve perfection on his instrument and the love of a woman. The 'Dies irae' motif stands for the devil, the Paganini theme for the composing violinist himself." #NT!

 elgar.1083.f: "'It was played in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, etc. At the first two performances I was present. It was played wonderfully. Its reception by both the public and critics was sour. One review sticks painfully in my mind: that I didn't have a Third Symphony in me any more. Personally, I am firmly convinced that this is a good work. But—sometimes composers are mistaken too! Be that as it may, I am holding to my opinion so far.' - Sergei Rachmaninoff" #NT!
 elgar.1091.t: "Romeo and Juliet" #NT!
 elgar.1091.f: "Romeo and Juliet is Sergei Prokofiev's longest and best-known ballet and is widely regarded as his most important contribution to the genre. It is considered a highlight of his musical work. The rich and varied instrumentation as well as the rhythmic complexity of the score still pose challenges for orchestra and dancers. In some places, dissonances border on atonality. The famous 'Dance of the Knights', with its dotted rhythms, is now better known as a quasi-symphonic theme. In contrast, the themes associated with Juliet's awakening to love are at once tender and youthfully lively. Prokofiev reused music from the ballet in three suites for orchestra and a solo piano work." #NT!
 elgar.1092.t: "Lieutenant Kijé" #NT!
 elgar.1092.f: "Lieutenant Kijé music was originally written to accompany the film of the same name. It was Prokofiev's first attempt at film music, and his first commission. In the early days of sound cinema, among the various distinguished composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance. Soon after the film's release, Prokofiev received an invitation from the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra to create an orchestral suite from his Kijé film music - probably the first instance of a film score being adapted into a significant musical work. While Prokofiev was in the United States for the Boston premiere he was greatly sought after by film producers, but although he was flattered and attracted by their offers he never composed a Hollywood film score." #NT!
 elgar.1093.t: "Peter and the Wolf" #NT!
 elgar.1093.f: "Peter and the Wolf is a 'symphonic fairy tale for children'. It is Prokofiev's most frequently performed work and one of the most frequently performed works in the entire classical repertoire. The narrator tells a children's story, while the orchestra illustrates it by using different instruments to play a 'theme' that represents each character in the story: 'Each character of this tale is represented by a corresponding instrument in the orchestra: the bird by a flute, the duck by an oboe, the cat by a clarinet playing staccato in a low register, the grandfather by a bassoon, the wolf by three horns, Peter by the string quartet, the shooting of the hunters by the kettle drums and bass drum. Before an orchestral performance it is desirable to show these instruments to the children and to play on them the corresponding leitmotifs. Thereby, the children learn to distinguish the sounds of the instruments during the performance of this tale.'" #NT!
  
 elgar.1101.t: "Die Fledermaus" #NT!
 elgar.1101.f: "Johann Strauss's Fledermaus is considered one of the highlights of the operetta era. Along with The Gypsy Baron and One Night in Venice, Die Fledermaus is one of the three most famous Strauss operettas and also one of the few operettas that are regularly performed at major international opera houses. The lyrics are catchy and full of irony with timeless truths. The essential parts of the music are said to have been created within 42 days. The overture, written in free sonata form, occupies a special place and is one of Johann Strauss' greatest creations. It summarizes the numerous musical highlights of the entire work and, with its varied dynamics, is always a challenge even for top orchestras." #NT!
 elgar.1102.t: "Donauwalzer" #NT!
 elgar.1102.f: "The waltz By the Beautiful Blue Danube (often shortened to: Danube Waltz) is compositionally based on melodies that Johann Strauss had already used in earlier works. Already at its premiere it sparked enthusiasm among the audience. Due to the large number of new musical releases in the carnival season at the time, the waltz did not initially catch on. However, because Strauss appeared in Paris at the 1867 World's Fair in the same year and created new compositions for it, he remembered to include this waltz in the program. Under the name Le beau Danube bleu, the piece became a great success during this exhibition. It is assumed that the published editions of the waltz, especially the two-hand piano version, were sold almost 1,000,000 times in a short period of time. The waltz is considered Austria's secret anthem and one of the most popular pieces in the entire history of classical music." #NT!
 elgar.1103.t: "A Night in Venice" #NT!
 elgar.1103.f: "A Night in Venice is a 'comic operetta' in three acts. The action takes place in Venice around the middle of the 18th century and is a comedy of disguise and mistaken identity with love confusion between two classes. Like many other Viennese operettas, the libretto is an adaptation of a French opéra-comique. The premiere in Berlin was a failure. This was partly due to the confusing plot, but also partly due to the underlying texts. The piece was therefore reworked for the premiere at the Theater an der Wien. The overture was also reworked by Strauss. The most famous musical numbers are the lagoon waltz and the gondola song. In 1923 and again in 1931 it was significantly revised by Erich Wolfgang Korngold; another version was written by Walter Felsenstein in 1954; the original version is now only very rarely performed." #NT!
 elgar.1111.t: "Rigoletto" #NT!
 elgar.1111.f: "Rigoletto is an opera by Giuseppe Verdi with a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave. It is based on the melodrama 'Le roi s'amuse' by Victor Hugo. The opera was initially criticized by the censors; Verdi and Piave therefore had to, among other things, change the originally intended title and move the setting from Paris to Mantua. However, the elements essential to Verdi, such as the crippled main character Rigoletto and the sack into which his dying daughter is put, remained intact. The opera is considered Verdi's first masterpiece and established his world fame. Verdi himself considered Rigoletto to be one of his most accomplished works, and unlike other Verdi operas, there are no revisions or new versions. Rigoletto was an overwhelming success at its premiere and was played at almost all European opera houses over the next few years. The opera has been part of the repertoire of many opera houses for over 160 years and remains one of the most frequently performed Italian operas." #NT!
 elgar.1112.t: "La Traviata" #NT!
 elgar.1112.f: "La traviata is an opera by Giuseppe Verdi and Francesco Maria Piave based on the novel La dame aux camélias by Alexandre Dumas the Younger. As before in Rigoletto and Il trovatore, Verdi placed a person ostracized and rejected by society at the center of the action. An opera about a courtesan who dies of tuberculosis was scandalous innovation at the time. The work failed at the premiere, even though Verdi had staged it himself and, as a precaution, moved the action to the time of Louis XIV. After its revision, Verdi had it performed again a year later - after which it became one of the most successful operas in music history. In some countries it is the most performed opera ever. In terms of the number of recordings made, La traviata is only surpassed by Aida. For censorship reasons, the opera was also performed in Italy under the title Violetta." #NT!
 elgar.1113.t: "Messa da Requiem" #NT!
 elgar.1113.f: "Under the impression of the death of Gioachino Rossini in 1868, Giuseppe Verdi invited the twelve most important composers in Italy at the time to jointly compose a funeral mass, the so-called Messa per Rossini. He himself took over the setting of the final movement, 'Libera me', in this requiem. However, a performance did not take place due to adverse circumstances. Verdi once again dealt with the Requiem material after the poet Alessandro Manzoni died in 1873. Verdi deeply admired the highly respected Manzoni. He offered the city of Milan the composition of a mass to be performed a year after Manzoni's death. The 'Libera me' from the Rossini Mass now became the nucleus of the new Requiem for Manzoni. The setting of 'Dies irae' from the older composition was taken up three times for passages of the sequence with the same or similar text. The first performance, at the San Marco church in Milan on May 22, 1874, marked the first anniversary of Manzoni's death. Verdi himself conducted." #NT!
 elgar.1121.t: "Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune" #NT!
 elgar.1121.f: "'The music of this prelude is a very free illustration of Mallarmé's beautiful poem. By no means does it claim to be a synthesis of it. Rather there is a succession of scenes through which pass the desires and dreams of the faun in the heat of the afternoon. Then, tired of pursuing the timorous flight of nymphs and naiads, he succumbs to intoxicating sleep, in which he can finally realize his dreams of possession in universal Nature.'\n\nPrelude to the Afternoon of a Faun is a symphonic poem for orchestra and one of Debussy's most famous works. The piece is considered a turning point in the history of Western art music as well as a masterpiece of Impressionist composition. Pierre Boulez considered the score to be the beginning of modern music, observing that 'the flute of the faun brought new breath to the art of music.'" #NT!

 elgar.1122.f: "'Last night's concert began with a lot of impressionistic daubs of color smeared higgledy-piggledy on a tonal palette, with never a thought of form or purpose except to create new combinations of sounds. … One thing only was certain, and that was that the composer's ocean was a frog-pond and that some of its denizens had got into the throat of every one of the brass instruments.'\n\nComposed between 1903 and 1905, La mer was premiered in Paris in October 1905. It was initially not well received. Even some who had been strong supporters of Debussy's work were unenthusiastic, even though the piece presented three key aspects of Debussy's aesthetic: Impressionism, Symbolism and Japonism. In the decades after the premiere La mer established itself in the core orchestral repertoire." #NT!
 elgar.1123.t: "Pelléas et Mélisande" #NT!
 elgar.1123.f: "'As a teacher he was pedantic—that's the only word. Really pedantic ... There was a core of anger and bitterness in him—I often think he was rather like Golaud in Pelléas and yet he wasn't. He was—it's in all his music—a very sensual man. No one seemed to like him. Jean Périer, who played Pelléas to my Mélisande, went white with anger if you mentioned the name of Debussy...'\n\nPelléas et Mélisande is an opera in five acts. The genre name of the composer Claude Debussy is 'Drame lyrique'. The text is an adaptation of the play Pelléas et Mélisande by Maurice Maeterlinck. Debussy avoided arias and larger solo scenes, which gave the text a realistic character. Pelléas was to be Debussy's only completed opera. For this reason it has sometimes been compared to Beethoven's Fidelio." #NT!
 elgar.1131.t: "Swan Lake" #NT!
 elgar.1131.f: "Swan Lake is a world-famous ballet to the music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, which premiered in 1877 at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow and is part of the standard repertoire of classical ballet companies. Common motifs from numerous fairy tales can be found in Swan Lake: in particular the unfortunate enchanted princess who is redeemed by the love of a prince. The unfortunate ending of the original libretto is also a well-known fairy tale motif of the swan girl or swan maiden. Tchaikovsky drew on previous compositions for his Swan Lake score. According to two of Tchaikovsky's relatives the composer had earlier created a little ballet called 'The Lake of the Swans' at their home in 1871. This ballet included the famous Leitmotif. He also made use of material from 'The Voyevoda', an opera he had abandoned in 1868. By April 1876 the score was complete, and rehearsals began. Soon the choreographer Reisinger began setting certain numbers aside that he dubbed 'undanceable'. Reisinger even began choreographing dances to other composers' music, but Tchaikovsky protested and his pieces were reinstated." #NT!

I must finish it as soon as possible, for I have to wind up a lot of affairs and I must soon go to London. I told you that I had completed a Symphony which suddenly displeased me, and I tore it up. Now I have composed a new symphony which I certainly shall not tear up.'\n\nTwo years after the premiere of his Symphony No. 5 in E minor, Op. 64, Tchaikovsky planned, as he wrote to a friend, 'to write a magnificent symphony that will form the keystone of my entire work'. The composer entitled the work 'The Passionate Symphony'. Characteristic of the work is the slow final movement - unusual for symphonies - whose end is reminiscent of a requiem." #NT!

 elgar.1133.f: "The Violin Concerto in D major is the only violin concerto by the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky wrote the concerto in March and April 1878 in Clarens, a wine-growing town on Lake Geneva. There he recovered from depression and a severe nervous breakdown. The positive effect of his stay was reflected in the concert, in which his newfound joy of life manifested itself. The composition work was completed after three weeks, although Tchaikovsky replaced the originally planned middle movement with the Andante known as 'Canzonetta'. Music critics reacted negatively to the work. Tchaikovsky reacted calmly and was convinced that the concerto would prevail. To this day, it is one of the most famous, most performed and most played violin concertos in the world." #NT!

The best known of the six marches, Pomp And Circumstance March No. 1 In D had its premiere, along with March No. 2, in Liverpool on 19 October 1901. Elgar and his wife attended, and it was a 'frantic' success. The Trio contains the tune known as 'Land of Hope and Glory'. In 1902 the tune was re-used, in modified form, for the 'Land of hope and glory' section of his Coronation Ode for King Edward VII. The words were further modified to fit the original tune, and the result has since become a fixture at the Last Night of the Proms, and an English sporting anthem and general patriotic song." #NT!

For this masque, the English composer Sir Edward Elgar wrote the music , with a libretto by Henry Hamilton. The masque consisted of two tableaux: 'The Cities of Ind' and 'Ave Imperator!'. Elgar later extracted five of the pieces and added an intermezzo for solo violin to create The Crown of India Suite.  The Suite gained immediate popularity: during Elgar's lifetime, there were 102 live performances of it on the BBC." #NT!

 elgar.1143.f: "The Enigma Variations are an orchestral work that describes the people from Elgar's environment in 14 variations. They made Elgar internationally known after their premiere by the conductor Hans Richter. The 'Enigma' from the title does not refer to the assignment of which variation is dedicated to which friend, but to another puzzle. According to Elgar, there is a different and larger theme running through the whole composition, but it is not played, and the actual theme is composed as a countermelody to it. Various theories have been put forward so far. The 9th variation (Nimrod) in particular gained great popularity." #NT!
 elgar.1151.t: "The 9th Symphony" #NT!
 elgar.1151.f: "In 1892, Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. While in the United States, Dvořák wrote one of his most successful orchestral works: the Symphony 'From the New World', which spread his reputation worldwide. It has been said that Dvořák was inspired by the 'wide open spaces' of America, such as prairies he may have seen on his trip to Iowa in the summer of 1893. Dvořák was also influenced by the style and techniques used by earlier classical composers including Beethoven and Schubert. The falling fourths and timpani strokes in the New World Symphony's Scherzo movement evoke the Scherzo of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. At the premiere in Carnegie Hall, the end of every movement was met with thunderous clapping and Dvořák felt obliged to stand up and bow." #NT!

 elgar.1152.f: "The Slavonic Dances are a collection of 16 instrumental pieces by Antonín Dvořák, written for piano four hands and each shortly afterwards arranged for orchestra. They are among the Czech composer's most famous works. Dvořák's compositions use characteristic rhythmic patterns of Bohemian and Moravian folk dances as well as those of neighboring countries. However, they are still completely independent creations of the composer. In the first row there are two Furiants characterized by rhythm changes, two Sousedskás similar to the Ländler, two Skočnás (fast jumping dance), a Polka and, as the only non-Czech dance, a Ukrainian Dumka. In the second series, non-Czech dances predominate, which is why Dvořák was exposed to some hostility. He was accused of not identifying enough with his homeland and instead wanting to make himself popular abroad." #NT!
 elgar.1153.t: "Rusalka" #NT!
 elgar.1153.f: "Rusalka is Antonín Dvořák's most successful opera. It was created based on a libretto by Jaroslav Kvapil and goes back to Slavic folk myths about the rusalky (water spirits, mermaids) and is similar to the German story Undine by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Little Mermaid and the Old French Melusine saga. The opera with the subtitle Lyric Fairy Tale is also known as the 'Czech Undine'. Along with Bedřich Smetana's The Bartered Bride, Rusalka is the most famous Czech opera. The opera Rusalka occupies a prominent place in the development of Czech dramatic music." #NT!
 elgar.1161.t: "Fantasie in C-Dur" #NT!
 elgar.1161.f: "The Fantasy in C major is one of Robert Schumann's most important piano compositions. Along with the Kreisleriana and Children's Scenes, it is one of the composer's best-known pieces and is part of the core of romantic piano literature. He dedicated it to Franz Liszt, the admired virtuoso who thanked him years later by donating his great B minor sonata to him. The visionary swing of this piano fantasy and the power sustained throughout the entire composition are reminiscent of the architectural mastery of Ludwig van Beethoven, from whose song cycle 'To the distant beloved' Schumann quotes several times in the first movement, while in the third movement he uses a theme from the Allegretto of the 7th Symphony takes up." #NT!
 elgar.1162.t: "Piano Concerto in A minor" #NT!
 elgar.1162.f: "The Piano Concerto in A minor op. 54 is a romantic solo concerto for piano and orchestra that was written during the High Romantic period. It bears many characteristics of the romantic era. Like some other piano concertos of the 19th century, the A minor concerto has a symphonic character. Since the work was initially conceived as a fantasy, the entire concert has romantic and fantastic impressions. Schumann needed over five years for the delayed completion. On the title page of the autograph, Schumann points out the different times in which the movements were written. The basic ideas of the work are longing and the happiness of two people in love. In this work, Schumann translates his fight for Clara Wieck into music. The main theme of the first movement is similar to the melody of the Florestan aria from Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Congruent with Beethoven, this theme also stands for spousal loyalty and the fight for freedom in Schumann." #NT!
 elgar.1163.t: "Kinderszenen" #NT!
 elgar.1163.f: "The Kinderszenen (Children's Scenes) is a cycle by Robert Schumann consisting of thirteen short piano pieces. In contrast to the 'Album for the Youth', these are pieces that were not composed for children, but, in Schumann's own words, as a 'reflection of an older person for older people'. The most famous and longest piece in the cycle is 'Träumerei'. With a playing time of just under 20 minutes, the Children's Scenes are among the most popular Romantic piano works today. Although the Children's Scenes were not particularly successful during Schumann's lifetime, the work had a special meaning, at least for him. An exchange of letters from 1839 shows that Schumann at that time firmly believed in the possibility of a marital union with Clara Wieck and that the Children's Scenes arose from his optimistic and cheerful side." #NT!

 elgar.1171.f: "Felix Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor is his last concerto. Well received at its premiere, it has remained among the most prominent and highly-regarded violin concertos. It holds a central place in the violin repertoire and has developed a reputation as an essential concerto for all aspiring concert violinists to master, and usually one of the first Romantic era concertos they learn. The work itself was one of the foremost violin concertos of the Romantic era and was influential on many other composers.Although the concerto consists of three movements in a standard fast-slow-fast structure and each movement follows a traditional form, it was innovative and included many novel features for its time. Distinctive aspects include the almost immediate entrance of the violin at the beginning of the work - rather than following an orchestral preview of the first movement's major themes, as was typical in Classical-era concertos." #NT!

The three études were later published separately under the title Trois nouvelles études. As the 'Magna Carta of piano playing' (Karl Schumann), they are among the most important piano compositions in music history. Great piano composers such as Alkan, Scriabin, Debussy and Rachmaninoff took their cues from them. Franz Liszt and Józef Wieniawski were the first pianists to publicly perform Chopin études." #NT!

 elgar.1191.f: "After years of listening to singers, romancing women with his music, and meeting famous people including Mendelssohn, Berlioz and Liszt, Glinka realized that his life's mission was to return to Russia, write in a Russian manner, and do for Russian music what Donizetti and Bellini had done for Italian music. A Life for the Tsar was the first of Glinka's two great operas. It was originally entitled Ivan Susanin. Set in 1612, it tells the story of the Russian peasant and patriotic hero Ivan Susanin who sacrifices his life for the Tsar by leading astray a group of marauding Poles who were hunting him. With this opera Glinka succeeded in creating an independent Russian music; it is considered the first Russian opera." #NT!

Pushkin's death in the famous duel prevented him from writing the libretto himself as planned. As with 'A Life for the Tsar', Ruslan employs some aspects of Russian folk music; it is also noted for imaginative use of dissonance, chromaticism, and Eastern elements. Of particular consequence is the use of the whole tone scale for the first time in Russian music. The rollicking overture is one of the best known orchestral showpieces in the West and known for being a nightmare for bassists." #NT!

 elgar.1193.f: "Kamarinskaya is a traditional Russian folk dance, which is mostly known today as the Russian composer Mikhail Glinka's composition of the same name. Glinka's Kamarinskaya, written in 1848, was the first orchestral work based entirely on Russian folk song and to use the compositional principles of that genre to dictate the form of the music. It became a touchstone for the following generation of Russian composers ranging from the Western-oriented Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to the group of nationalists known collectively as The Five and was also lauded abroad, most notably by French composer Hector Berlioz. For Tchaikovsky, Kamarinskaya offered a viable example of the creative possibilities of folk songs in a symphonic structure, using a variety of harmonic and contrapuntal combinations." #NT!
