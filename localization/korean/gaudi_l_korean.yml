 je_gaudi_secession_1: "The First Art Nouveau Secession" #NT!
 je_gaudi_secession_1_reason: "The new art movement of Art Nouveau has attracted numerous artists. Under certain conditions, this can result in an established artistic movement that enjoys international renown and gives painting and architecture new impetus. Historically, one of the most important associations of this type was the Vienna Secession. The Vienna Secession, more precisely the Association of Austrian Artists, is an association of artists in Vienna from the fin de siècle period. Derived from this, the Viennese variant of Art Nouveau is also referred to as Secession style or Viennese Art Nouveau." #NT!

 je_gaudi_splendid_architecture: "Splendid New Architecture" #NT!
 je_gaudi_splendid_architecture_reason: "With the introduction of Art Nouveau and Art Deco, architects revolutionized the art world, for example by breaking with the rigid historicism of the past. But unlike many modern schools, their buildings were not an expression of mere functionality and objectivity. Art Deco is a development in the midst of the general awakening of classical modernism, in which the creative combination of elegance of form, preciousness of materials, strength of colors and sensuality of the topic was in the foreground. During its heyday, it represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. An architecture that respects these principles would make our nation a poster child of modernity and wealth." #NT!
 je_gaudi_splendid_architecture_goal: "#E Splendid Architecture#! reaches #BLUE 10#! points. At the moment, we have #G [ROOT.Var('gaudi_splendid_architecture').GetValue]#! @gaudi_architectural_splendor! points. Building Art Nouveau quarters, Art Deco Cinemas, Art Deco Skyscrapers, Art Deco Offices and Art Deco Airports via Journal Entry will give you more points." #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_nouveau_quarter: "Art Nouveau Quarter" #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_nouveau_quarter_reason: "The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Hôtel Tassel was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Horta's work in Brussels and applied the style for the entrances of the new Paris Métro. From Belgium and France, Art Nouveau spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country. It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities (Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany) as well as in centres of independence movements (Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain)." #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_deco_cinema: "Art Deco Cinema" #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_deco_cinema_reason: "Many of the best surviving examples of Art Deco are cinemas built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Art Deco period coincided with the conversion of silent films to sound, and movie companies built large display destinations in major cities to capture the huge audience that came to see movies. Movie palaces in the 1920s often combined exotic themes with art deco style; Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood (1922) was inspired by ancient Egyptian tombs and pyramids, while the Fox Theater in Bakersfield, California attached a tower in California Mission style to an Art Deco hall." #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_deco_skyscraper: "Art Deco Skyscraper" #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_deco_skyscraper_reason: "Skyscrapers are the bell towers of the present. But what is a bell tower without a distinctive chime? Refining a skyscraper in Art Deco style would be a prestigious endeavor that will draw admiration from around the world." #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_deco_airport: "Art Deco Airport" #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_deco_airport_reason: "Caravels once opened up the oceans to Europeans and connected the continents of the known world with the New. Now that the age of aviation has arrived, previously fixed frontiers are opening up. What style could be more appropriate than the luxurious and up-and-coming art deco to welcome the ports of the new flying ships? Aviators, say hello to the sun!" #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_deco_office: "Art Deco Office" #NT!
 je_gaudi_art_deco_office_reason: "The Art Deco style dominated the commercial world and entertainment industry, but the respective governments also wanted to impress with modern buildings that underlined the prosperity of the country and gave their own population the feeling of living in an aspiring nation." #NT!
 je_gaudi_bauhaus: "Bauhaus" #NT!
 je_gaudi_bauhaus_reason: "The Bauhaus was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts. The school became famous for its approach to design, which attempted to unify individual artistic vision with the principles of mass production and emphasis on function. It was grounded in the idea of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk (comprehensive artwork) in which all the arts would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, modernist architecture, and architectural education." #NT!
  
 je_gaudi_summer_burn: "Burning of the Summer Palace" #NT!
 je_gaudi_summer_burn_reason: "The Summer Palace has been the actual seat of the imperial family of the Qing Dynasty since the first half of the 18th century. It is the symbol of China's greatness and grandeur. A destruction meant not only a considerable humiliation of the enemy, but also opened up the chance for valuable loot..." #NT!

 je_gaudi_ben_burn: "Burning Big Ben" #NT!

 je_gaudi_dombau_phase_1: "Cologne Cathedral: Resumption of construction" #NT!

In 1885 he presented a new overall concept with a Gothic design language, in which 18 towers are recognizable, albeit on a smaller scale than in the current project. The outer wall of the apse, completed in 1893, is taller than del Villar's project.

Simultaneously with the construction of the crypt, Gaudí began to fundamentally redesign the plans for the church. In 1885 he presented a new overall concept with a Gothic design language, in which 18 towers are recognizable, albeit on a smaller scale than in the current project. The outer wall of the apse, completed in 1893, is taller than del Villar's project. It contains neo-Gothic elements, but shows Gaudí's signature in the idiosyncratic use of the Gothic forms, the naturalistic gargoyles and the pinnacle tips." #NT!

 gaudi_sagrada_phase_3_decision_desc: "Dedicated to the birth of Jesus, the Nativity façade is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life. Characteristic of Gaudí's naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner. The façade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ. It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity). The Tree of Life rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity." #NT!

 gaudi_sagrada_phase_4_decision_desc: "The church plan is that of a Latin cross with five aisles. The columns of the interior are a unique Gaudí design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. Essentially none of the interior surfaces are flat; the ornamentation is comprehensive and rich, consisting in large part of abstract shapes which combine smooth curves and jagged points. Even detail-level work such as the iron railings for balconies and stairways are full of curvaceous elaboration." #NT!

All of the towers, whose shapes are intended to evoke a bishop's crosier, have long vertical notches and colorful spiers that are decorated with animals or sacred symbols and quotations from the Bible.

 gaudi_sagrada_phase_6_decision_desc: "In contrast to the highly decorated Nativity Façade, the Passion Façade is austere, plain and simple, with ample bare stone, and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton. Dedicated to the Passion of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his crucifixion, the façade was intended to portray the sins of man. Gaudí intended for this façade to strike fear into the onlooker. He wanted to 'break' arcs and 'cut' columns, and to use the effect of chiaroscuro (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice. Facing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Façade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble strained muscles." #NT!

The terminals of the towers are 22.5 m high, made up of three different parts: the base is made up of four lines of hexagons with the inscriptions Al·leluia and Amen surrounded by herringbone-shaped ceramic palms; in the central part there is an icosahedron intersected with a sphere covered with ceramic trencadís and Venetian glass, which contains the lighting sources; and, as a finish, there are the sculptures of the Tetramorphs, winged and with an evangelical book with the initials of each evangelist. The tower of Mary is located on the apse and is topped by a large twelve-pointed star, which symbolizes the morning star. In addition, it carries several iconographic elements alluding to the Virgin, such as the Hail Mary and various flowers as a symbol of the attributes of the mother of Jesus." #NT!

To reach the Glory Portico the large staircase leads over the underground passage built over Carrer de Mallorca with the decoration representing Hell and vice. It will be decorated with demons, idols, false gods, heresy and schisms, etc. Purgatory and death will also be depicted, the latter using tombs along the ground.

Each of the four arms of the cross has powerful beams of light that are visible at great distances, in remembrance of the biblical passage that defines Jesus as 'I am the light of the world'.

 gaudi.11.f: "The Vienna Secession is an art movement, closely related to Art Nouveau, that was formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian painters, graphic artists, sculptors and architects, including Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, Otto Wagner and Gustav Klimt. They resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists in protest against its support for more traditional artistic styles. Their most influential architectural work was the Secession Building designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich as a venue for expositions of the group. Their official magazine was called Ver Sacrum (Sacred Spring, in Latin), which published highly stylised and influential works of graphic art. In 1905 the group itself split, when some of the most prominent members, including Klimt, Wagner, and Hoffmann, resigned in a dispute over priorities, but it continued to function, and still functions today, from its headquarters in the Secession Building.

Important artists included Gustave Strauven, who used wrought iron to achieve baroque effects on Brussels facades; the furniture designer Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, known for his highly original chairs and articulated metal furniture; and the jewellery designer Philippe Wolfers, who made jewellery in the form of dragonflies, butterflies, swans and serpents. The style was quickly noticed in neighbouring France. After visiting Horta's Hôtel Tassel, Hector Guimard built the Castel Béranger, among the first Paris buildings in the new style. Parisians welcomed Guimard's original and picturesque style; the Castel Béranger was chosen as one of the best new façades in Paris, launching Guimard's career. The Paris 1900 Exposition universelle marked the high point of Art Nouveau. Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware, furniture and decorative objects of the style. While the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much to popularize the style." #NT!

In the 1920s, New York architects used the new Art Deco style to build the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. The Empire State building was the tallest building in the world for forty years.

Later, publicists celebrated Cologne Cathedral as a work of art that was still waiting to be completed. Finally, the Catholic publicist Joseph Görres shifted the argument when in 1814 he praised the cathedral as a national sanctuary and thus made it a symbol for the desired German national state. Sulpiz Boisserée, an art dealer based in Cologne, was at the center of the persistent campaigning for the completion of the cathedral. His efforts received a boost when, in 1814 and 1816, he and Georg Moller were able to rediscover the façade plan from 1370 that underlies the west façade of the cathedral. Between 1821 and 1831 Boisserée published a series of engravings showing the completed cathedral. This work significantly promoted enthusiasm for cathedral construction throughout Germany. The romantic transfiguration of the Gothic, which was understood at the time as a genuinely German architectural style, and the stylization of the cathedral as a German national monument finally won over the Prussian Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm to the cathedral project. The idea of completing the cathedral, originally pursued in Cologne, thus became a Prussian and even national-German matter and, for the first time, a realistic option." #NT!

In order to raise the remaining construction costs, the Central Cathedral Building Association (Zentral-Dombau-Verein) in Cologne was founded, which was initially financed by contributions. When the interior was completed in 1863, projections showed that, assuming the same financial flow, it would take another 50 years to complete.

This supremacy drew critics to the scene. The democratic movement demanded more say for the people in political issues. The sworn circle of politicians around Alfred Escher - the 'Escher system' - became the declared enemy of the democrats. This was fought against with pamphlets and popular assemblies, which ultimately weakened his influence. It became even more difficult by the fact that his Northeast Railway increasingly slipped into financial crisis in the 1870s." #NT!

His susceptibility to illness did not go well with his heavy workload. During the critical phase of the Gotthard project, Escher almost worked himself to death. Constant health ups and downs followed: asthma, fever, eye problems, boils. However, this did not prevent Escher from fulfilling his political and economic obligations whenever possible.

The decision was made when Alfred Escher, the president of the Zurich-based Swiss Northeastern Railway, finally endorsed the route over the Gotthard. In addition, the route over the Gotthard was the shortest.

Grattoni had already built the world's longest tunnel, the Mont Cenis railway tunnel, at 12 kilometers. He had also dealt with the Gotthard, had examined the geology and carried out test drilling. Favre, who had never built a tunnel longer than 1,000 meters, undercut his fellow competitors, accepted the ruinous terms of the contract and posted a deposit of CHF 8 million.

The political decisions and negotiations for the financing of the Gotthard railway in the run-up to the founding of the Gotthard railway company and its management in the early days of construction were essentially made by the former President of the Government Council of the Canton of Zurich and later three-time President of the National Council, Dr. Alfred Escher coined. After the financing of the Gotthard project had been secured almost exclusively by state subsidies from Switzerland, its cantons and from 1869 by Italy, the North German Confederation and its legal successor from 1871 the German Reich, the Gotthard Railway Company was founded from the Gotthard Association, which transferred its rights to the Gotthard Railway Company.

Here Luigi Dissune presented the demands of the workers to applause: one franc more wages per day, functioning ventilation and better safety regulations.

 gaudi.301.f: "Christ the Redeemer is the largest statue in the world built in Art Deco style. The face of the statue was created by the sculptor Gheorghe Leonida who was born in Galati, Romania in 1893. He studied sculpture at the Bucharest Conservatory of Fine Arts and then, after studying in Italy for another three years, won the Reveil Sculpture Prize. Famed in France as a portraitist, he was recruited by Paul Landowski into the team that began work on Christ the Redeemer in 1922. Gheorghe Leonida contributed by depicting the face of Jesus Christ on the statue, a fact that made him famous. A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's presentations and made the decision to build the structure out of reinforced concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) rather than steel, which would be more appropriate for a cruciform statue. The outer layers are made of soapstone, chosen for its durability and ease of use. It took nine years to build and cost the equivalent of $250,000 (or $3.3 million in 2014 value)." #NT!

The new synagogue was designed to demonstrate the presence, advancement, and integration of the city's Jewish citizens. The nominated architect Alessandro Antonelli was to take on the job. However, Antonelli was also known for his monumental buildings, the dimensions of which he expanded. In the Piedmontese town of Castellamonte, for example, Antonelli had planned a cathedral that would have rivaled that of St. Peter's in Rome; but the mammoth project remained unfinished because of the lack of financing. A similar fate now threatened the Jewish community with its new synagogue, which grew sky-high by the day, but threatened to become a financial disaster for the Jewish community. The Turin city authorities bought the building and compensated the Jews with new land and a new synagogue, which was built in a few years. Instead, the "Mole" should become a national symbol of Italy." #NT!

From 90 meters upwards he therefore broke with the square-based architectural theme, designing a granite colonnade with a circular base, called the 'Lantern', placed on a truncated cone base. Likewise, the architect also conceived the design of a spire of about 50 meters above the Lantern, with an octagonal section, and interspersed with ten circular terraces, the first two still equipped with a colonnade, then upwards gradually more and more small, and accessible by a small zig-zag ladder." #NT!

A few months after his death, the architect suggested finishing the spire with a statue depicting a 'Winged Genius'. The design of the statue was commissioned to the sculptor Fumagalli; the Genius, made of embossed and gilded copper, weighed about 300 kg, and had a spear in one hand and a palm branch in the other. The statue reached a total height of 5.46 meters. After Antonelli's death, the completion of the spire was overseen above all by his son Costanzo and his pupil Crescentino Caselli. With the final laying of the 'Winged Genius', the building reached an overall height of 167.35 metres, a height, at the time, never reached by any masonry construction in Europe and the world. The Mole, the tallest masonry construction in the world, entered into direct 'competition' with the Eiffel Tower in Paris, inaugurated just 10 days earlier and which would have been the tallest building in the world until 1930." #NT!

It is also a matter of course to plan a church building in the Piedmont province in the dimensions of St. Peter's in Rome. And it is certainly not a sign of slight megalomania that a considerable number of his buildings are never completed because they do not meet one's own requirements.

The title of tallest masonry building in Europe therefore passed to the bell tower of the Cathedral of Ulm, Germany (161.53 meters), while Philadelphia City Hall passed the title of tallest masonry building in the world (162.53 metres).

All the Viennese newspapers were available in a better Viennese coffee house, and not just the Viennese ones, but those of the entire German Reich, French, English, Italian, and American, as well as all the important literary and artistic reviews in the world. So we knew everything that was going on in the world first hand, we heard about every book that was published, about every performance, wherever it was taking place, and compared the reviews in all the newspapers. Perhaps nothing contributed so much to the intellectual flexibility and international orientation of the Austrian as the fact that he was able to orientate himself so comprehensively about all events in the world in the coffee house and at the same time discuss them in friendly circles.

These buildings were mostly built by the old nobility or by bankers and industrialists in the late 19th century. The palaces were built in the Ringstrasse style, a mixture of Neo-Baroque and Neo-Renaissance, or Neo-Mannerism. They were also a symbol of rise and status.

The resulting fire spread to the backdrop trains before rapidly spreading to the rest of the stage and eventually the auditorium. The fire had domestic and international effects on preventive fire protection, especially in the theater area and the corresponding legal provisions for theater construction in Austria.

The barracks were named after Emperor Franz Joseph I and built in 1854-1857 in the wake of the 1848 revolution. Shortly after its construction, the barracks stood in the way of the development of the Vienna Ringstrasse, which began in 1857, but it took four decades for the army to move out of here again.

In the course of the demolition of Vienna's city wall, the city wall was redesigned into the Vienna Ringstrasse, and the then Mayor of Vienna, Andreas Zelinka, supported the project for a public park on this site. This park was planned in the style of English landscape parks by the landscape painter Joseph Sellény. At the water glacis there was a spa pavilion where medicinal water was served for drinking cures. Accordingly, the Kursalon was built for the city park according to plans by Johann Garben. The magnificent building in the style of the Italian Renaissance is located on Johannesgasse and has a wide terrace in the park.

As a cultural institution, the Vienna State Opera is the successor to the Vienna Court Opera, which was founded and promoted by the Habsburgs. In addition, the Vienna State Opera Orchestra continues the tradition of the Vienna Court Orchestra, which has been in use since 1498. In 1860, the new building for the Court Opera was tendered as the first monumental building on the Ringstrasse to be financed from Vienna's city expansion fund. Numerous architects took part in the architectural competition. The construction was based on plans by the architects August Sicard von Sicardsburg and Eduard van der Nüll in neo-Renaissance style. The building was not well appreciated by the public. On the one hand, compared to the huge Heinrichshof, a private apartment building, it could not develop a real monumental effect. Mockery and criticism eventually drove van der Nüll to commit suicide. Since Emperor Franz Joseph had also criticized the architect, he was shocked.

The town hall facade is an outstanding example of a neo-Gothic secular building. The exterior, particularly the 98 m high tower, is inspired by the tradition of Flemish Gothic town halls, such as the Brussels Town Hall on the Grand-Place/Grote Markt, to tie in externally with the medieval tradition of urban freedom.

The plan was to create a rectangular square that would be framed by the Leopoldine Wing, the New Hofburg, the Habsburg Collections and by a counterpart of the New Castle that was never built on the site of the Volksgarten. The name Heldenplatz was fixed in 1878; it comes from the two equestrian monuments, both of which are by Anton Dominik Fernkorn. The older one is Archduke Karl's, which was unveiled in 1860. The counterpart, the equestrian statue of Prince Eugene, was also completed in 1865. After the loss of World War I, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy under the rule of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty and the founding of the first Austrian republic, Heldenplatz served as a rallying point for all political camps and as a parade ground for the Austrian army." #NT!

This makes it one of the oldest art academies in Europe. n 1872 Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria approved a statute making the academy the supreme government authority for the arts.

He also gave folklore lectures and developed the idea of a folk-educational institution. However, since he was called to Berlin in 1885, he continued to develop his ideas there. The Urania in Vienna was modeled on the Urania in Berlin: it had space for 800 people and contained a lecture hall for 200 people, rooms for scientific demonstrations and an observatory. However, this 'temporary' Urania could hardly cope with the influx of visitors, so that a new building on Ringstrasse soon became necessary. The Urania not only expanded its range of educational opportunities (e.g. through language courses), but also became a venue for concerts, with its own Urania symphony orchestra and Urania choir. The unconventional shape and construction caused the usual scandal in Vienna. The Viennese liked the building, however, and the Urania soon established itself as one of Vienna's landmarks." #NT!
