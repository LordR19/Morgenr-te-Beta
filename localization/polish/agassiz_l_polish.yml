 agassiz.201.f: "The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a mountain range in the Atlantic Ocean that lies mostly below sea level and extends for around 20,000 km. This makes it the longest of the mid-ocean ridges, a system that spans the Earth and is over 60,000 km long. Seafloor rise in the mid-Atlantic was first described by naval officer Matthew Fontaine Maury in 1853 and confirmed by the Challenger expedition in 1872. The reason was preliminary investigations into the laying of the first transatlantic deep-sea cables. During the German Meteor Expedition 1925-1927, a detailed profile of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was created using echo sounder measurements. The discovery of the Mid-Atlantic mountain range provided an early clue to the geodynamic processes of plate tectonics related to Wegener's theory of continental drift." #NT!

George Cuvier is considered the father of paleontology, but also the godfather of geology. Even in the scientific disputes, for example in the Cuvier-Geoffroy debate of 1830, which centered on the dispute between gradualism and catastrophism, it was primarily geological and paleontological findings that were highlighted as agruments.

 agassiz.311.f: "The first meteorite collections were founded as early as the 18th century, before it was known that meteorites were of extraterrestrial origin. The oldest meteorite collection in the world is in the Natural History Museum in Vienna, where the foundation stone was laid with the Hraschina meteorite (fallen in 1751). Today it is home to the largest exhibition collection in the world with around 1,100 objects. Until the twentieth century, only a few hundred meteorite finds had ever been discovered. The reason there are now more than 30,000 meteorite finds in the world's collections started with the discovery by Harvey H. Nininger that meteorites are much more common on the surface of the Earth than was previously thought. Nininger's strategy was to search for meteorites in the Great Plains of the United States, where the land was largely cultivated and the soil contained few rocks." #NT!

Until the turn of the century, many scientists believed that the Earth was only a few million years old - at the end of his life, Lord Kelvin only assumed it was 20 million years old. But even Charles Darwin, who was one of the 'maximalists' who defended his thesis, believed in around 300 million years. It was not until the discovery of radioactivity that the age of the Earth could be correctly determined and the true extent of the age of the Earth (and therefore of the entire solar system) became known." #NT!

 agassiz.501.f: "The oldest suggestion that continental drift was the cause came from the Flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius. In the 1596 edition of his Atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, the similarity of the two coastlines can already be clearly seen. Alexander von Humboldt described the similarity of the opposite coasts of South America and Africa and their vegetation in 1801 and 1845 and speculated that the Atlantic was washed out by a catastrophic current. In 1858, geographer Antonio Snider-Pellegrini went a step further when he published the first map showing the Old and New Worlds without a separating ocean. However, it was above all Alfred Wegener who, with his theory of continental drift, led to a rethinking from fixism (the thesis that the continents are firmly rooted in the earth) to mobilism. During his lifetime, however, his explanation model remained a minority opinion in science, which only became established in the second half of the 20th century." #NT!

 agassiz.504.f: "Fixism was the key geotectonic hypothesis until the 1960s. It was assumed that the earth's crust was firmly connected to the subsoil, so that large-scale tectonic processes were local. From this it followed that the development of the earth was predominantly characterized by vertical and very little by horizontal tectonic movements of the earth's crust. Most theories of classical geology were based on the idea of fixism. At the beginning of the 10th century, fossils of the same species were found in South America and Africa. Under the assumption of fixism, the land bridge hypothesis was put forward, according to which there were once land bridges connecting Africa to South America, allowing animals to migrate to the other continent. Through the echo sounder measurements of the research ship Meteor between 1924 and 1927, during which the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - an undersea mountain range that runs from north to south - was discovered and not, as expected, the remnants of a land bridge that should have run from east to west, the land bridge hypothesis began to falter but was not completely abandoned until the 1960s. The opposite of fixism is mobilism, which sees horizontal movements of the earth's crust as having a decisive influence.

In 1860 he gave up the chair and instead took over the chair of geophysics and meteorology that he had initiated. Attached to the chair were the meteorological observatory and the Vesuvius Observatory, founded in 1842, which Palmieri also took over management. He headed the chair and the two observatories until his death. Palmieri became known in particular for improved measuring devices, such as an electromagnetic seismograph and devices for measuring electrical voltages in the atmosphere. In 1882 he succeeded in detecting the element helium on Earth for the first time through spectral analysis of Vesuvius lava." #NT!

Through the beds of schist, coloured with delicate shades of green, ran in winding course threads of copper and manganese, with traces of platinum and gold. I thought, what riches are here buried at an unapproachable depth in the earth, hidden for ever from the covetous eyes of the human race! About six o'clock this brilliant fête of illuminations underwent a sensible abatement of splendour, then almost ceased. As I had foretold, the water failed entirely by the end of the first day's retrograde march. Our fluid aliment was now nothing but gin; but this infernal fluid burned my throat, and I could not even endure the sight of it. I found the temperature and the air stifling. Fatigue paralysed my limbs. More than once I dropped down motionless. Then there was a halt; and my uncle and the Icelander did their best to restore me. But I saw that the former was struggling painfully against excessive fatigue and the tortures of thirst.  We arrived on our hands and knees, and half dead, at the junction of the two roads. There I dropped like a lifeless lump, extended on the lava soil." #NT!

 agassiz.914.f: "As if by a miracle we found water: a torrent led cold water deep into the earth's interior and filled our supplies. But when we followed it and came to its end, an even greater surprise awaited us. At first I could hardly see anything. My eyes, unaccustomed to the light, quickly closed. When I was able to reopen them, I stood more stupefied even than surprised.  A vast sheet of water, the commencement of a lake or an ocean, spread far away beyond the range of the eye, reminding me forcibly of that open sea which drew from Xenophon's ten thousand Greeks, after their long retreat, the simultaneous cry, 'Thalatta! thalatta!' the sea! the sea! The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine shining sand, softly lapped by the waves, and strewn with the small shells which had been inhabited by the first of created beings. The waves broke on this shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to vast inclosed spaces.  It was quite an ocean, with the irregular shores of earth, but desert and frightfully wild in appearance. It will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven days in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to breathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles." #NT!

 agassiz.915.f: "The diffused light revealed the smallest object in the dense and distant thickets. I had thought I saw - no! I did see, with my own eyes, vast colossal forms moving. They were gigantic animals; it was a herd of mastodons - not fossil remains, but living and resembling those the bones of which were found in the marshes of Ohio in 1801. I saw those huge elephants whose long, flexible trunks were grouting and turning up the soil under the trees like a legion of serpents. I could hear the crashing noise of their long ivory tusks boring into the old decaying trunks. I looked, shaking my head incredulously. But though at first I was unbelieving I had to yield to the evidence of my senses. In fact, at a distance of a quarter of a mile, leaning against the trunk of a gigantic kauri, stood a human being, the Proteus of those subterranean regions, a new son of Neptune, watching this countless herd of mastodons. Yes, truly, huger still himself. It was no longer a fossil being like him whose dried remains we had easily lifted up in the field of bones; it was a giant, able to control those monsters. In stature he was at least twelve feet high. His head, huge and unshapely as a buffalo's, was half hidden in the thick and tangled growth of his unkempt hair. It most resembled the mane of the primitive elephant. In his hand he wielded with ease an enormous bough, a staff worthy of this shepherd of the geologic period." #NT!

 agassiz.916.f: "In another quarter of an hour our nimble heels had carried us beyond the reach of this horrible monster. And yet, now that I can reflect quietly, now that my spirit has grown calm again, now that months have slipped by since this strange and supernatural meeting, what am I to think? what am I to believe? I must conclude that it was impossible that our senses had been deceived, that our eyes did not see what we supposed they saw. No human being lives in this subterranean world; no generation of men dwells in those inferior caverns of the globe, unknown to and unconnected with the inhabitants of its surface. It is absurd to believe it! I had rather admit that it may have been some animal whose structure resembled the human, some ape or baboon of the early geological ages, some protopitheca, or some mesopitheca, some early or middle ape like that discovered by Mr. Lartet in the bone cave of Sansau. But this creature surpassed in stature all the measurements known in modern palæontology. But that a man, a living man, and therefore whole generations doubtless besides, should be buried there in the bowels of the earth, is impossible. However, we had left behind us the luminous forest, dumb with astonishment, overwhelmed and struck down with a terror which amounted to stupefaction. We kept running on for fear the horrible monster might be on our track. It was a flight, a fall, like that fearful pulling and dragging which is peculiar to nightmare. And, wonderfully interested, we peered all along the high wall, peeping into every fissure which might open out into a gallery. There, upon a granite slab, appeared two mysterious graven letters, half eaten away by time. They were the initials of the bold and daring traveller: 'A. S.,' shouted my uncle. 'Arne Saknussemm! Arne Saknussemm everywhere!'" #NT!

He was listening anxiously for the murmur of distant springs. But, no, there was dead silence. And now my limbs were failing beneath me. I resisted pain and torture, that I might not stop my uncle, which would have driven him to despair, for the day was drawing near to its end, and it was his last. At last I failed utterly; I uttered a cry and fell. 'Come to me, I am dying.' My uncle retraced his steps. He gazed upon me with his arms crossed; then these muttered words passed his lips: 'It's all over!' The last thing I saw was a fearful gesture of rage, and my eyes closed." #NT!

 agassiz.918.f: "I have a confused impression left of continuous explosions, loud detonations, a general shaking of the rocks all around us, and of a spinning movement with which our raft was once whirled helplessly round. It rocked upon the lava torrent, amidst a dense fall of ashes. Snorting flames darted their fiery tongues at us. There were wild, fierce puffs of stormy wind from below, resembling the blasts of vast iron furnaces blowing all at one time; and I caught a glimpse of the figure of Hans lighted up by the fire; and all the feeling I had left was just what I imagine must be the feeling of an unhappy criminal doomed to be blown away alive from the mouth of a cannon, just before the trigger is pulled, and the flying limbs and rags of flesh and skin fill the quivering air and spatter the blood-stained ground. \n\n When I opened my eyes again I felt myself grasped by the belt with the strong hand of our guide. I found myself lying on the sloping side of a mountain only two yards from a gaping gulf, which would have swallowed me up had I leaned at all that way. Above our heads, at a height of five hundred feet or more, we saw the crater of a volcano, through which, at intervals of fifteen minutes or so, there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire, mingled with pumice stones, ashes, and flowing lava. I could feel the heaving of the mountain, which seemed to breathe like a huge whale, and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes. Beneath, down a pretty steep declivity, ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred feet, giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet. But the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich verdure, amongst which I was able to distinguish the olive, the fig, and vines, covered with their luscious purple bunches." #NT!

The outcome of this was an inverted pendulum seismometer constructed by James David Forbes, first presented in a report by David Milne-Home in 1842, which recorded the measurements of seismic activity through the use of a pencil placed on paper above the pendulum. The designs provided did not prove effective, according to Milne's reports. It was Milne who coined the word seismometer in 1841, to describe this instrument." #NT!

It is significantly superior to the previous seismometer and can detect earthquake areas much better. This enables us to make more precise preparations for emergencies." #NT!
 agassiz.802.f: "The first seismographs were invented in the 1870s and 1880s. The first seismograph was produced by Filippo Cecchi in around 1875. However, the instrument was not sensitive enough, and the first seismogram produced by the instrument was in 1887, by which time John Milne had already demonstrated his design in Japan. In 1880, the first horizontal pendulum seismometer was developed by the team of John Milne, James Alfred Ewing and Thomas Gray, who worked as foreign-government advisors in Japan, from 1880 to 1895. Milne, Ewing and Gray, all having been hired by the Meiji Government in the previous five years to assist Japan's modernization efforts, founded the Seismological Society of Japan in response to an Earthquake that took place on February 22, 1880, at Yokohama." #NT!

 je_agassiz_seismograph_reason: "A seismograph on a seismometer improves the recording of earthquakes and earth tremors in an amazing way. This would finally make a more modern type of seismology possible. A seismoscope would trigger the device to begin recording, and then a recording surface would produce a graphical illustration of the tremors automatically (a seismogram)." #NT!

 agassiz.302.f: "A geyser is a hot spring that emits its water as a fountain at regular or irregular intervals. Such an eruption is called an eruption. Geysers are named after the Great Geysir in Iceland. Geysers require a special combination of geological and climatic conditions that only exist on a large scale in a few places. Geysers depend on three factors: a water supply in the form of an aquifer, a heat source, and at least one reservoir with a constriction to the associated plumbing system. Over 300 active geysers, about half of all existing in the world, are located in Yellowstone National Park." #NT!
