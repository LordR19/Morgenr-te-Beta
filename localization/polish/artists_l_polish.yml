In 1910 the first internationally well-known artists were displayed: a room dedicated to Gustav Klimt, a one-man show for Renoir, a retrospective of Courbet. A work by Picasso 'Family of Saltimbanques' was removed from the Spanish salon in the central Palazzo because it was feared that its novelty might shock the public. By 1914 seven pavilions had been established: Belgium (1907), Hungary (1909), Germany (1909), Great Britain (1909), France (1912), and Russia (1914). " #NT!

 artists.2007.f: "In art history, realism refers to a new conception of art that began in Europe in the middle of the 19th century, which turned against representations of classicism and romanticism. In art, realism attempts to recreate reality as closely as possible. The artist's appropriation of reality and its subsequent transformation into a work of art as well as its political connotations are characteristic of realism. It promotes everydayness and objectivity.

 artists.2011.f: "The Fin de Siècle, also known as 'Décadence', refers to the artistic trends and attitude to life of the last two decades of the 19th century and, in a broader sense, parallel to the Belle Époque up to the beginning of the First World War. The term refers to the fact that it was a cultural movement that made cultural decline its object. The time was characterized by a wavering between a spirit of optimism, euphoria for the future, diffuse fear of the future and regression, apocalyptic mood, weariness of life, world-weariness, fascination with death and transience, light-heartedness, frivolity and decadence. A general crisis gripped the leading social classes because basic values of social life appeared to be at risk. A feeling of powerlessness became characteristic of intellectuals, artists and writers because they felt attracted and repelled in the face of a metropolitan society dominated on the one hand by market law and anonymous masses and, on the other hand, by a world increasingly characterized by natural sciences and technology.
