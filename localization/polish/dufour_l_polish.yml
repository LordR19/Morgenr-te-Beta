 dufour.1000.d: "Women's suffrage has been introduced in Switzerland. Unfortunately, some Cantons are a bit slow. In the Cantons of Appenzell Innerhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden, women are allowed to participate in federal votes and elections, but not in those of the municipalities and the Canton. It would first need an amendment to the Cantonal Constitution and this would have to be approved at a Landsgemeinde. The process could take several years.

Schwingen - a form of wrestling with very strict rules - was a popular sport in Switzerland, although its origin can't be traced well. But the first local Schwingfest was held at the Unspunnenmatte in Interlaken. The first Eidgenössisches Schwing- und Älplerfest was held in 1895 in Biel and then regularly all two or three years.

It encompases parts of Vaud, Neuchâtel, Bern, both Basel, Solothurn and Aaargau. many big cities are close to the Jura.\n Basel for example is one of the most important cities of Switzerland. Basel borders both the Alsace as well as Baden and is well connected thanks to the Rhine River.\nJust a few years ago the Canton of Basel was divided into the Cantons of Basel Stadt (City) and Basel Land (Countryside). Interestingly the countryside was more liberal during that time, while the city was ruled by Patricians. Basel is a quite international and has an old University that harbored great thinkers like Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli.\nGeneva on the other hand is a big city surrounded by France. during Napoléon's reign it was part of France and returned to Switzerland in 1815.

Thanks to the energy of the river, Schaffhausen was able to industrialize quite early and thanks to the rural people it become a liberal Canton in 1831.\nThurgau was ruled by another Canton that changed every year until the French Revolution spread to Switzerland. It is a full Canton since 1815 and a center of textile industries and agriculture. The high amount of pear trees lead to the name \"Mostindien\" meaning Cider India which is a play on Ost (east) and Most (Cider). Thurgau is one of the liberal Cantons since 1831 and wants more centralization in Switzerland.\nSt. Gallen is a split Canton in regards to religion and was once the seat of monastery and a Prince Bishopric. It is a center of the textile industry and a liberal Canton. The Canton of St. Gallen surrounds both Appenzell Cantons and the remarkable Säntis mountain range, a part of the Alps." #NT!

Particularily the Rhaetian Alps named after the ancien Rhaeti tribes. Grisons is mostly an agrarian Canton that profits from the transport of goods over the Alpine passes as well. The loss of some now Italian lands after the Napoleonic Wars was a catastrophe but Grisons still has some areas that have a majority of Italian speaking people making it a Canton with three language groups: German, Rumantsch and Italian\nPolitically Grisons is dominated by its municipalities that have a lot of power.

First the Cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Underwalden (today separated in Nied- and Obwalden) formed a loose alliance which later was expanded more and more.\nThe main part of the economy of the many small Cantons in central Switzerland is the transport of goods mainly on the Gotthard route. Apart from that agriculture, logging and some textile production were important in the region.\nPolitically central Switzerland was dominated by conservative catholics. While the Canton of Luzern was the most liberal out of the Cantons in Central Switzerland thanks to the City of Luzern, the smaller Cantons of Uri, Schwyz, Ob- and Nidwalden, Glarus and Zug were even more conservative and dominated by the local upper classes.\nSchwyz was nearly split into two Cantons in the 1830s, when the outer parts of the Canton demanded equality and political participation. After inner Schwyz was occupied by troops of the Tagsatzung (the \"government\" of Switzerland) inner Schwyz agreed to those points in the end and Schwyz stayed one Canton." #NT!

As a conquest of the 15th and 16th centuries, the area was dominated by the old places (Cantons) until the founding of the Helvetic Republic. Since 1803, however, it has been a fully-fledged canton.\nThe dominant economic sectors in Ticino were agriculture and logging. Silk production was also a lucrative business. Agricultural products that did not grow elsewhere in Switzerland could be cultivated in Ticino: chestnuts, tobacco, silk and various fruits, for example.\nIn 1830 Ticino was one of the first Cantons to gain a liberal constitution. The political situation in the Canton however is unstable as the liberals want to centralize the state while the conservatives prefer regional autonomy." #NT!

Bern reaches from the Jura mountain range all the way to the Alps in the south. Fribourg is located west of Bern and hosts towns like Fribourg and Gruyère where a well known chesse comes from.\nThe Canton of Bern is mostly dominated by agriculture but But watchmaking has slowly spread from neighboring Neuchâtel to the Bernese Jura. Hopefully industrialization will soon help develop the Canton.\nPolitically Bern was long dominated by the Patricians of the city itself but in the 1830s the liberals from the smaller towns in the Canton were able to draw up a new constitution that balanced the rights of the people of Berne and the rural population.\nFribourg is a Canton dominated by agriculture, especially grain production and cheese. The cheese from Gruyère is especially well known.\nPolitically, Fribourg was dominated by the conservative Patricians and the Clergy. Even when a new constitution was issued in 1831, the Canton remained conservative and in the elections the conservatives still gained the majority of the votes." #NT!

 dufour.916.d: "More sheets were published. This time focused on Zürich and Aargau." #NT!
 dufour.916.f: "Both Zürich and Aargau are located in the north of Switzerland mostly in the relatively flat Mittelland (central land). Both Cantons are rapidly industrializing and might become industrial powerhouses quite soon.\nZürich is one of the old Cantons and was dominated by the city itself for quite a long time. Zürich is a center of the mechanized textile industry as well as the machine industry. Many factories are located at rivers and get their energy from those rivers.\nPolitically Zürich was dominated by the Patricians of the City until 1830/31 when the people of the countryside forced a new constitution to be enacted. In the next elections, the liberals and radicals gained a majority and are now dominating the politics in Zürich.\nAargau was ruled by the other Cantons until the time of the Helvetic Republic. Now that it is a full Canton, Aaargau is industrializing fast, especially with textile factories. The many rivers of Aargau allowed for factories to get their energy from the water and lead to many decentralized factories.\nAargau was basically counterweight to the cantons of Zurich and Bern and nearly did not become a full Canton in 1814/15. Even after 1815 Aargau stayed quite liberal unlike other Cantons. In 1831, a new constitution gave the population even more rights. The government responded to the resistance of the Catholic population to the increased control of the church by the state by occupying rebellious regions." #NT!

The Rhône river flows through the valley and then into the Lac Léman. The Northern coast of the Lake is part of Vaud, but the Canton extends from Geneva and the Alps to the Jura.\nVaud is still dominated by agriculture but the liberals started to implement changes to grow the industry since 1826. Time will tell if Vaud will remain an agricultural Canton or become a center of industry.\nThanks to diplomatic skill, the canton of Vaud was confirmed after Napoleon's defeat. In return, however, the canton had to accept a more conservative constitution. Thanks to the authoritarian leadership, the liberals gained ground and were able to push through a new constitution in 1830. In the meantime, the radicals were gaining ground and trying to promote democratization.\nValais is dominated by agriculture and its rural population. There is no significant industry and outside connections are limited.\nThe main political conflict in Valais was the one between the german speaking upper Valais and the french speaking lower Valais. Upper Valais has been the dominant part of the Canton even though the Lower Valais had a higher population. The question is whether the liberals and radicals of the lower valley are in a position to promote the democratization of Valais or whether the old forces can stabilize their rule." #NT!
