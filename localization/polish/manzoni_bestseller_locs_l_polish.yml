Taxing their subjects for the pettiest of reasons, punishing harshly for disobedience or even without a reason. Their tyranny led the Grand Dominion of Imperia from a prosperous and powerful past to a starving, war-torn realm ravaged by poverty and blight.\n\nYet they demanded for more, causing the Imperian people to rebel and protest, eventually managing a bloody revolution, where a new government was established and the once royals captured.\n\nNow the question remained, what is to be done with them. Some wanted them beheaded instantly, others advocated a longer punishment.\n\nThus, after a short debate, a workhouse of horrors was chosen for the once powerful to spend the rest of their lives in.\n\nSo begins our tale of well-deserved justice, revenge, and the rebirth of a once glorious nation of Imperia!" #NT!
