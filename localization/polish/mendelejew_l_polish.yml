 mendelejew.101.f: "The term chemical element arose in the 17th century when it was increasingly recognized that the concept of elements in alchemy was unsuitable for a scientific explanation of the diverse properties of substances and their reactions with one another. Robert Boyle published an influential critique of the inadequacies of alchemy in 1661 called 'The Sceptical Chymist'. In it he explained that by chemical elements one should understand those primitive substances 'which have neither arisen from other substances nor from each other, but which form the components of which mixed substances are made'." #NT!

It is still unknown how exactly these can be determined, but a hypothesis should soon be formulated." #NT!
 mendelejew.102.f: "The term 'elements' (stoicheia) was first used by Greek philosopher Plato around 360 BCE in his dialogue Timaeus, which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a speculative treatise on chemistry. Plato believed the elements introduced a century earlier by Empedocles were composed of small polyhedral forms: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air), icosahedron (water), and cube (earth)." #NT!

However, the current obligations in the course of element research cause problems in the curriculum. There are already complaints that seminars and lectures are being neglected." #NT!
 mendelejew.111.f: "The German chemistry professor Justus von Liebig was particularly popular among his students because of his modern learning methods.

Again the atoms were gamboling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by the repeated visions of the kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold conformation; long rows sometimes more closely fitted together all twining and twisting in snake-like motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and this time also I spent the rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth ... but let us beware of publishing our dreams before they have been put to the proof by the waking understanding.' -August Kekulé" #NT!

Spectroscopy was initially used as an astronomical technique with experiments by William Hyde Wollaston, who built the first spectrometer to display the spectral lines of the sun's rays. These spectral lines were later characterized by Josef von Fraunhofer. Later, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen discovered that each chemical element was associated with a specific number and arrangement of spectral lines. They concluded from this that the lines observed by Wollaston and Fraunhofer were due to the absorption properties of these elements in the upper layers of the sun and that these must therefore also be present in the photosphere." #NT!

In the course of medieval mining history, small amounts of admixtures of unknown metals were discovered in ores, especially in the Ore Mountains, and were named after mountain spirits (cobalt, nickel). The discovery of phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand finally ushered in the age of discovery of most elements, including uranium from pitchblende by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1789." #NT!

 mendelejew.211.f: "Setting up laboratories and purchasing new equipment or instruments was anything but a given.

 mendelejew.212.f: "A chemical compound is a chemical substance composed of many identical molecules (or molecular entities) containing atoms from more than one chemical element held together by chemical bonds.

This occurs by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions. In modern laboratory uses, the process is reproducible and reliable. A chemical synthesis involves one or more compounds (known as reagents or reactants) that will experience a transformation when subjected to certain conditions.

 mendelejew.312.f: "Dissociation in chemistry is a general process in which molecules (or ionic compounds such as salts, or complexes) separate or split into other things such as atoms, ions, or radicals, usually in a reversible manner. For instance, when an acid dissolves in water, a covalent bond between an electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom is broken by heterolytic fission, which gives a proton (H+) and a negative ion.
