 verrier_physics_tech_desc: "Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics. Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies (determined by Kepler between 1609 and 1619), Galileo's pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Isaac Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation (that would come to bear his name)." #NT!
 verrier_astronomy_tech: "Modern Astronomy" #NT!
 verrier_astronomy_tech_desc: "During the 18-19th centuries, the study of the three-body problem by Leonhard Euler, Alexis Claude Clairaut, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Pierre Simon Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations." #NT!
 verrier_electromagnetism_tech: "Electromagnetism" #NT!
 verrier_electromagnetism_tech_desc: "In 1864 James Clerk Maxwell of Edinburgh announced his electromagnetic theory of light, which was perhaps the greatest single step in the world's knowledge of electricity. Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light obviously involved the existence of electric waves in free space, and his followers set themselves the task of experimentally demonstrating the truth of the theory. The discovery of electromagnetic waves in space led to the development of radio in the closing years of the 19th century." #NT!
 verrier_chemistry_tech_desc: "The development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by Alessandro Volta. ritish William Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. J.A.R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements." #NT!
  
 je_verrier_neptune: "The Unknown Planet" #NT!
 je_verrier_neptune_reason: "In 1821, Alexis Bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus, making predictions of future positions based on Newton's laws of motion and gravitation. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesize some perturbing body. These irregularities, both in the planet's ecliptic longitude and in its radius vector (its distance from the Sun), could have been explained by several hypotheses: the effect of the Sun's gravity at such a great distance might differ from Newton's description; or the discrepancies might simply be observational error; or perhaps Uranus was being pulled, or perturbed, by an undiscovered planet. John Couch Adams learned of these irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the perturbation hypothesis. Adams believed that he could use the observed data on Uranus and Newton's law of gravitation to deduce the mass, position, and orbit of the perturbing body. Meanwhile, on 10 November 1845, Urbain Le Verrier presented to the Académie des sciences in Paris a memoir on Uranus and showed that the pre-existing theory failed to account for its motion. Unaware of Adams's work, he attempted a similar investigation, and on 1 June 1846, in a second memoir presented to a public meeting of the Académie, he gave the position, but not the mass or orbit, of the proposed perturbing body. Le Verrier located the unknown planet within one degree of its discovery position. Le Verrier was unaware that his public confirmation of Adams' private computations had set in motion a British search for the purported planet. On 31 August, Le Verrier presented a third memoir, now giving the mass and orbit of the new body. Now it was only a matter of finding the celestial body and thereby proving its existence." #NT!

 je_verrier_pluto: "Planet X" #NT!
 je_verrier_pluto_reason: "In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune. In 1906, Percival Lowell - a wealthy Bostonian who had founded Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894 - started an extensive project in search of a possible unknown planet, which he termed 'Planet X'. By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet. Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Planet X on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were. Percival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929. Vesto Melvin Slipher, the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old Clyde Tombaugh, who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings. Tombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates." #NT!

 je_verrier_charter_moon: "Map the Moon" #NT!
 je_verrier_charter_moon_reason: "Selenography is the study of the surface and physical features of the Moon (also known as geography of the Moon, or selenodesy). Like geography and areography, selenography is a subdiscipline within the field of planetary science. Historically, the principal concern of selenographists was the mapping and naming of the lunar terrane identifying maria, craters, mountain ranges, and other various features. Lunar mapping became systematic in 1779 when Johann Schröter began meticulous observation and measurement of lunar topography. In 1834 Johann Heinrich von Mädler published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published The Universal Selenography. All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when J.W. Draper, using a 5 inch reflector, produced a daguerreotype of the Moon and thus introduced photography to astronomy. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the telescope 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of astronomy." #NT!

 verrier_asteroid_congress_decision_desc: "Since the discovery of Ceres in 1801, astronomers have found more and more celestial bodies, which is why the number of planets in the solar system has continued to increase. The discovery of Neptune raised the question of whether a new category might make more sense for the numerous, smaller objects found particularly between Mars and Jupiter. In particular, the invention of new astronomical symbols and their relatively small size led astronomers to assume that they were more likely 'small stars' or 'small planets'. Of course, this categorization would mean that some of the objects previously considered planets would lose their status and would be degraded to mere boulders." #NT!

That day, the two scientists presented independent technical papers on the size scale of the Universe, followed by a public discussion in the evening. We can hold such a congress to discuss the ultimate mysteries of the universe." #NT!

These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the Earth's surface. Very intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which produce at least 1,000 meteors an hour, most notably from the Leonids." #NT!

He noted 'a little cloud' where the Andromeda Galaxy is located. From 1751 to 1753, Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille cataloged 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope, most of which were previously unknown. The number of nebulae was then greatly increased by the efforts of William Herschel and his sister Caroline Herschel, whoroughly 2,000 nebulae.

Saturn has 83 moons with confirmed orbits that are not embedded in its rings. as well as dense rings that contain millions of embedded moonlets and innumerable smaller ring particles. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those, Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium.

In 1834 Johann Heinrich von Mädler published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published The Universal Selenography. All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when J.W. Draper, using a 5 inch reflector, produced a daguerreotype of the Moon and thus introduced photography to astronomy. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the telescope 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of astronomy." #NT!

In 1893, Grove Karl Gilbert suggested for the first time that the Moon's craters were formed by large asteroid impacts." #NT!
 verrier.53.t: "Lunar maria" #NT!
 verrier.53.f: "The lunar maria are large, dark, basaltic plains on Earth's Moon, formed by ancient asteroid impacts on the far side on the Moon that triggered volcanic activity on the opposite (near) side. They were dubbed maria, Latin for 'seas', by early astronomers who mistook them for actual seas. They are less reflective than the "highlands" as a result of their iron-rich composition, and hence appear dark to the naked eye. The maria cover about 16% of the lunar surface, mostly on the side visible from Earth. The few maria on the far side are much smaller, residing mostly in very large craters. The traditional nomenclature for the Moon also includes one oceanus (ocean), as well as features with the names lacus ('lake'), palus ('marsh'), and sinus ('bay'). The last three are smaller than maria, but have the same nature and characteristics." #NT!
 verrier.54.t: "Lunar highlands" #NT!
 verrier.54.f: "The lighter-colored regions of the Moon are called terrae, or more commonly highlands, because they are higher than most maria. They have been dated to having formed 4.4 billion years ago, and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean. The concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after the Moon's formation." #NT!

It remained a naked-eye object until November for Southern Hemisphere observers. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful comets observed, and was one of the brightest of the century, making a strong impression both on artists and the general public. After a prior period of hysteria on the subject of comets, especially in Paris (caused partly by incorrect calculations by John Russell Hind which suggested that one would strike the Earth in June 1857) it went on to be the most-observed of the century due to its excellent visibility in dark skies for Northern Hemisphere viewers, particularly in Europe, and fine weather in September and October.

The object was hardly distinguishable in the small telescope attached to the sextant, and I found it necessary to employ a coloured glass between the index and horizon glasses, for the superior brilliance of the reference stars Procyon, Sirius, and Canopus, when they were brought into the field of view, quite extinguished its feeble light. Every comet hunter knows how necessary it is to the carrying out of his work to have at hand a copious catalogue of nebulae, but this valuable adjunct I unfortunately did not possess.

Curtis, on the other hand, contended that Andromeda and other such 'nebulae' were separate galaxies, or 'island universes' (a term invented by the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant, who also believed that the 'spiral nebulae' were extragalactic).

Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year.  In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life.

 verrier.93.f: "General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. Einstein's theory has astrophysical implications, including the prediction of black holes - regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. Black holes are the end-state for massive stars. Microquasars and active galactic nuclei are believed to be stellar black holes and supermassive black holes. It also predicts gravitational lensing, where the bending of light results in multiple images of the same distant astronomical phenomenon." #NT!

As a result of this discovery, the comet is named after Halley. The 1910 approach was notable for several reasons: it was the first approach of which photographs exist, and the first for which spectroscopic data were obtained. American satirist and writer Mark Twain was born on 30 November 1835, exactly two weeks after the comet's perihelion. In his autobiography, published in 1909, he said: ' came in with Halley's comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it.

He first derived 'Hubble's law', now called the Hubble–Lemaître law by the IAU, and published the first estimation of the Hubble constant in 1927, two years before Hubble's article. Lemaître also proposed the 'Big Bang theory' of the origin of the universe, calling it the 'hypothesis of the primeval atom', and later calling it 'the beginning of the world'.

Physicists now call these quanta photons. This assumption, incompatible with classical physics, is regarded as the birth of quantum physics and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of Planck's career. The discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units, all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based.

Using the Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson, Hubble identified Cepheid variables, a standard candle discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. Comparing their apparent luminosity to their intrinsic luminosity gives their distance from Earth. Hubble found Cephieds in several nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum Nebula. His observations, made in 1924, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside our own, thus today they are no longer considered nebula.

It is the basis for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry he was awarded in 1908 'for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances'. Rutherford moved to the UK, where he and Thomas Royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. Later he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden.

It was published in two volumes between 1868 and 1870, and Mendeleev wrote it as he was preparing a textbook for his course. As he attempted to classify the elements according to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led him to postulate his periodic table; he claimed to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream: 'I saw in a dream a table where all elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper, only in one place did a correction later seem necessary.' By adding additional elements following this pattern, Mendeleev developed his extended version of the periodic table.

Galle found Neptune in the same night he received Le Verrier's letter, within 1° of the predicted position. After that Le Verrier took on the task to '... embrace in a single work the entire planetary system, put everything in harmony if possible, otherwise, declare with certainty that there are as yet unknown causes of perturbations...', a work which would occupy him for the rest of his life. Le Verrier began by re-evaluating, to the 7th order, the technique of calculating the planetary perturbations known as the perturbing function. This derivation, which resulted in 469 mathematical terms, was complete by 1849. He next collected observations of the positions of the planets as far back as 1750.

The discovery of Astraea should be the prelude to further discoveries in the asteroid belt and was the last major discovery of a celestial body before the discovery of Neptune.

The first director of the Sternwarte, [SCOPE.sCharacter('verrier_new_astronomer_scope').GetFullName], wants to focus on the observation of sunspots. The building was constructed by Gottfried Semper, a German architect who had to flee from repression in Saxony.\n\n   #b Historically, #! The Eidgenössische Sternwarte was built between 1862 and 1864 by Gottfried Semper who was the first professor of architecture at the Polytechnikum. He planned the main building of the Polytechnikum as well. The Sternwarte focused on the observation of sunspots and was the place where the observations to calculate the Zurich Sunspot Number was coordinated. The Zurich number, invented by the first director of the Sternwarte, Rudolf Wolf, is a way to measure the amount of sunspots and to estimate the activity of the sun. With the number it was actually possible to use data that was gathered since 1610 and calculate the historic sun activity.\n   After the Cantonal Hospital was built close to the Sternwarte in 1945 observing the night sky became limited. The observation was stopped in 1980. Today the former observatory houses the Collegium Helveticum of the Eidgenössisch Technische Hochschule. The Collegium is an interdisiplinary research institute.

On Earth, this causes disturbances in the ionosphere with corresponding impairments in radio traffic. When the particles enter the Earth's atmosphere, they cause magnetic storms.

The aurora over the Rocky Mountains in the United States was so bright that the glow woke gold miners, who began preparing breakfast because they thought it was morning. People in the northeastern United States could read a newspaper by the aurora's light.

For this occasion, the Royal Prussian Observatory at Königsberg commissioned one of the city's most skilled daguerreotypists, Johann Julius Friedrich Berkowski, to record a still image of the event.

When he announced his discovery, no one initially believed him because no new element had ever been found in space before it was proven on the planet Earth could be guided. On October 20 of the same year, the Englishman Norman Lockyer confirmed that the yellow line was indeed present in the solar spectrum and concluded that it was caused by a previously unknown element. Since this spectral line was very close (1.8 nm from the center) to the Fraunhofer double-D line (D2 = 589.00 nm, D1 = 589.60 nm) of the metal sodium, he named the line D3 to describe it to be distinguished from these lines D1 and D2 of sodium.

It was the first satellite to be discovered photographically. Phoebe is named after Phoebe, a Titaness in Greek mythology associated with the Moon, who was the sister of Cronus. 'In 1900, even I', Pickering stated, 'began to wonder if the four images of 1898 might not, after all, have been defects or faint stars occuring by a curious coincidence.' However, Pickeirng found Phoebe again. He believed he discovered a tenth Saturnian moon in 1905 from plates taken in 1904, which he called 'Themis'. For this discovery he was awarded the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1905. 'Themis' was later shown to not exist." #NT!

 verrier.543.f: "The moon Ariel is the brightest and fourth largest of the known moons of the planet Uranus. Ariel and Umbriel were discovered on October 24, 1851 as the third and fourth moons of Uranus by the British astronomer William Lassell using a 60 cm reflecting telescope at a self-built observatory in Liverpool. The moon was named after a sylph in Alexander Pope's epic poem The Rape of the Lock." #NT!

It was discovered at the same time as Ariel and named after a character in Alexander Pope's 1712 poem The Rape of the Lock. Although William Herschel, the discoverer of Titania and Oberon, claimed at the end of the 18th century that he had observed four additional moons of Uranus, his observations were not confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious." #NT!

 verrier.545.f: "Miranda was discovered on 16 February 1948 by planetary astronomer Gerard Kuiper using the McDonald Observatory's 82-inch (2,080 mm) Otto Struve Telescope. Its motion around Uranus was confirmed on 1 March 1948. It was the first satellite of Uranus discovered in nearly 100 years. Kuiper elected to name the object 'Miranda' after the character in Shakespeare's The Tempest, because the four previously discovered moons of Uranus, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon, had all been named after characters of Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. However, the previous moons had been named specifically after fairies, whereas Miranda was a human." #NT!

 verrier.551.f: "Triton is the largest natural satellite of the planet Neptune. It is the only moon of Neptune massive enough to be rounded under its own gravity and hosts a thin but well-structured atmosphere. Triton orbits Neptune in a retrograde orbit—an orbit in the direction opposite to the parent planet's rotation—the only large moon in the Solar System to do so. Triton was discovered by British astronomer William Lassell on October 10, 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, he wrote to Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell discovered Triton eight days later. A brewer by trade, Lassell spotted Triton with his self-built 61 cm (24 in) aperture metal mirror reflecting telescope (also known as the 'two-foot' reflector). Triton is named after the Greek sea god Triton, the son of Poseidon (the Greek god corresponding to the Roman Neptune)." #NT!

Kuiper using photographic plates taken with the 82-inch telescope at the McDonald Observatory. He proposed the name in the report of his discovery. It is named after the Nereids, sea-nymphs of Greek mythology and attendants of the god Neptune. It was the second, and last, moon of Neptune to be discovered before the arrival of Voyager 2." #NT!

 verrier.49.d: "Researchers at our observatory have observed unusual solar activity associated with sunspots." #NT!
 verrier.49.f: "Sunspots are dark spots on the sun's visible surface (photosphere) that are cooler and therefore emit less visible light than the rest of the surface. Their number and size form the simplest measure of so-called solar activity. The frequency of sunspots has a periodicity of an average of eleven years, which is called the sunspot cycle. The cause of the spots and the eruptions that occur near them are strong magnetic fields, which in some areas hinder the transport of heat from the interior to the sun's surface. A few unknown spots were discovered." #NT!
