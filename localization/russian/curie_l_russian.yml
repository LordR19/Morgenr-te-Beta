 curie.10.f: "Uranium (named after the planet Uranus) is a chemical element with the element symbol U and the atomic number 92. Uranium compounds were used throughout the 19th century to color glass and ceramics, vases and decorative pieces, but also everyday objects such as bowls or glasses. Glass manufacturers in Joachimsthal (Bohemia) used this technique as early as 1826. Uranium was used to color glass until the middle of the 20th century, only then was it replaced by other, less harmful coloring minerals. Uranium-containing ceramic glazes ranging from orange to bright red were used on everything from tableware to architectural accessories. This ceramic, called 'Fiestaware' in the USA because of the name of a manufacturer, is probably one of the most radioactive items that can still be found in many American households." #NT!
