After the discovery of the monumental inscription of Behistun, which contained older languages ​​of Mesopotamia in addition to the now well-known Persian, it was only a matter of time before Elamite, Babylonian and Akkadian would be understandable again after centuries.

The boat threatens to tip into the Nile as the expedition's members pile up at the railing, glancing at the silhouette of the city known in ancient Egypt as Thebes. Ruins of millennia-old structures line the banks of the Nile, obelisks rise up between dilapidated houses and tents. On the other bank of the Nile, however, rise the sandy-brown mountain ranges where the legendary Valley of the Kings is hidden, and where it is said that there are still unknown tombs of the pharaohs. But before we can get to that, we still have a few things to settle in Luxor..." #NT!
 lepsius.200.f_ex_loe: "The 'Mother of the World' lies above the waters of the Nile glittering in the sun. Minarets and domes adorn the panorama and tell of the power and importance of this city, which once and now helped determine the fate of the Middle East. Colorful bazaars and carpets characterize the streets as well as the fine ornamentation of Fatimid architecture. But the view goes further - far beyond, where the tops of the pyramids herald a bygone era, which is the real goal of our journey. But before that, we have to take a few precautions in Cairo." #NT!
 lepsius.200.f_ex_bab: "Baghdad, Mesopotamia's largest city, is bustling with activity. Like Cairo, it is a center of the Arab world; like Cairo, it was the seat of power and prestige. But unlike Cairo, where the distant pyramids of Giza herald an even older world, there is little in Baghdad that evokes the empires of Babylon and Akkad. Even the alleged antiques that a somewhat careless expedition member bought from a shady dealer have turned out to be fakes. While the stone buildings of the Egyptians and Maya still bear witness to the lost civilizations, there is hardly anything comparable here. We'll probably have to start from scratch." #NT!
 lepsius.200.f_ex_ass: "What else can be found in Assyria after Layard dug at Nimrud? Quite a lot, according to a trader in Mosul. Only a month ago, the head of a lamassu emerged from the sand. And the bazaar always offers good pieces, he tells us. The fact that a whole series of pieces could not be salvaged also has to do with the Kurdish clans in the area, who do not allow everyone to poach in their areas - regardless of excavation license. We'll take the warning with us - and get the essentials before we start the journey." #NT!
 lepsius.200.f_ex_arg: "Ah, good old Athens! Not old enough for what our expedition team is looking for, but good enough to spend extra days in Attica. Greece does not have many large cities, so our expedition team has little choice but to make the most necessary preparations there before setting off into the countryside. Our archeology guide pushes us hard, as some scholars spend far too much time on distractions—whether it's classic marble or Greek wine. The warm sun, the shade of olive trees and the Akkadian idyll invite to linger and relax - some seem to have already forgotten why we are really here." #NT!
 lepsius.200.f_ex_cre: "A light breeze blows in from the Aegean Sea as our expedition reaches the port of Heraklion. Old-time Venetian bastions salute, reminiscent of times when Candia was a trading hub in the Middle Ages. After the cargo is unloaded to the croaking of seagulls and the participants go ashore, the friendly reception is followed by bitter reality. While some participants complain about the local cuisine and demand better accommodation, the lead archaeologist has little sympathy for such less intellectual requests. Because Heraklion is only a way station for him - the treasures of the Minoans await in the interior of the island." #NT!
 lepsius.200.f_ex_yuc: "In Mérida, our excavation team is making the final preparations before the big departure. The traces of Spanish conquest and colonization characterize the city, which despite its manageable size shows that it was once, together with Campeche, the place from which the Spanish exercised control of the peninsula. Less than 100 miles away are said to be some Mayan sites that the jungle has reclaimed over the past few centuries.

The journey to Cuzco was arduous, but technological advances mean that expeditions no longer become adventurous journeys full of unpredictability. In the streets of the former capital of the Incas, historic Spanish dominance is combined with the charm of Andean architecture. In between, seamless cyclopean walls still bear witness to the architecture of the former rulers.

Interpreters not only have the advantage that they speak the language, but also that local people trust them more quickly. The chance of getting information about artifacts is considerably higher. On the other hand, greater mobility through more beasts of burden and porters enables us to move from one place to another more quickly.

Instead of going the long way around, some Greek fishermen offered to take us across the bay. The expedition leader quickly accepted the offer. In a conversation with the fishermen, he was also able to obtain important information about a ruin not far away, which probably dates from pre-classic times." #NT!

 lepsius.410.f_yucatan: "The forests of the Yucatán are full of dangers: jaguars, snakes and poisonous insects lurk in the bushes. At the same time, the expedition members are fascinated by the flora and fauna - in particular by a small, colorful parrot that flies away over hats and helmets and does not leave the travelers' side. The bird appears extremely clever and can now even be fed regularly. The expedition leader has now declared the parrot to be the company's mascot and intends to take it home after the end of the trip." #NT!
 lepsius.410.f_peru: "The condor is the king of the Andes. The huge birds rule the air, their shadow puffs up to unimagined size. Since the beginning of the expedition, he has been looming over the alpacas and porters in a downright menacing manner. The locals don't trust the animal. As a vulture, it is known to circle over cadavers rather than the living. The queasy feeling spreads among some participants." #NT!

 lepsius.421.f: "Unfortunately, during a smaller dig near a mastaba, our excavation team found nothing - with the exception of a small, lapis lazuli blue scarab. The scarab was considered a good luck charm in ancient Egypt. The scarab's behavior of rolling dung balls in front of it related to Re and his journey across the sky on the sun barge. Our expedition leader asked if we could perhaps make a small exception and keep the essentially secondary piece as a souvenir for himself." #NT!

 lepsius.422.f: "At first our men thought it was a dune - but a tiny pinnacle of worked limestone told our archaeologists that the unusual mountain of sand in the Egyptian desert held a secret. Within a few days the expedition uncovered a temple. For some, the result was disappointing because it did not resemble an ancient Egyptian structure, but turned out to be a structure from the time of Alexander the Great. However, experts say that the temple was evidence of the activities of the Greek general in Egypt - whose tomb has not been found to this day." #NT!

Our expedition was fortunate to secure an exceptionally beautiful and well-preserved statuette while searching for an excavation site; it's already on its way to our museum . A cuneiform inscription that identifies the being as a temple guard is also revealing. Our archaeologists have theorized that these temple keepers represent a connection to the Israelite cherubim mentioned in the Bible. Two of them also protected the Ark of the Covenant that stood in the Jerusalem Temple." #NT!

 lepsius.424.f: "When our archaeologists examined an ancient city wall on the outskirts of a small town, they actually didn't expect to find a great deal. Only when they felt the stone did they notice that there were cavities in the structure. After a detailed investigation, they broke open the wall at a certain point - as it turned out, cuneiform tablets were built into the wall! The depot is surprisingly well preserved and provides some information about ancient Mesopotamia." #NT!

 lepsius.425.f: "During one of our Greek expeditions, our archaeologists made a curious discovery. A small bullet arrived at the museum management in the morning. The director didn't understand at first why his men sent him a marble back; under normal circumstances it was just a trivial find. But the amber-colored sphere consists of an unknown material that we have never encountered anywhere else. So far, experts have been at a loss as to what to make of the artifact, with some believing it is a fake. Others claim that this is an indication that our knowledge of the Aegean world is totally inadequate." #NT!

 lepsius.426.f: "What was rubbish for the ancients is a treasure trove for an archaeologist. This motto has only recently come true when our expedition stopped at a smaller ruin in search of an excavation site, and on closer examination found a pit with a pottery depot. Many of the shards still need to be mended, but the numerous finds will definitely enrich our museum collection." #NT!

 lepsius.427.t: "Maya Jade" #NT!
 lepsius.427.d: "Our archaeologists have found valuable Mayan artifacts made of jade." #NT!
 lepsius.427.f: "Jade was a material widely used by the Maya in the fields of art and religion. The elite adorned themselves with jade, and the sun god was also depicted in jade jewellery. However, the peoples of Central America also made tools from jade because it was one of the hardest materials known from the New World. Our archaeologists were lucky enough to find a few such jade artifacts during their last dig." #NT!

 lepsius.428.f: "A golden statuette of the Inca god Inti arrived at the museum via express delivery this morning. Our archaeologists don't say how or where they got it. A grimace, horrible and beautiful at the same time, looks at the observer. Some experts have already expressed doubts as to whether the piece is of Inca origin at all. The design indicates an unknown culture. In addition, almost all Inca gold was stolen from Peru. It is perhaps the most unique item in our pre-Columbian collection to date. The museum director is already whispering behind closed doors that some legends might be true after all." #NT!

 lepsius.429.f: "A trusted dealer, our excavator swears, recently showed him an extraordinarily interesting, as well as sinister, piece. It is a human skull - made entirely of Mesoamerican quartz. The surface is amazingly well polished and the work surpasses anything we have ever known about the cultures of the South American continent. But the doubts are great. Even our chief archaeologist isn't 100% sure what to make of the artifact." #NT!
 lepsius.429.g: "We add it to the collection." #NT!
 lepsius.429.h: "Definitely a fake." #NT!
 lepsius.430.t: "Fake Crystal Skull" #NT!
 lepsius.430.d: "The alleged artifact that was sold to us years ago as a sensation is actually a fake." #NT!
 lepsius.430.f: "How could that happen? Were we too careless? Too selfish because we rush from sensation to sensation and only believe what we want to believe? The legendary crystal skull that our museum acquired as an attraction years ago is a cheap fake. It will be years before our standing in the archaeological world is restored!" #NT!

 lepsius.431.f: "When our expedition makes a stop in a small town on our route, we meet an elderly farmer who has heard about our destination. In exchange for some bread, salt and water, he is extremely accommodating. 'The other villagers have already told me what you are looking for,' he explains. He takes us half a day's journey through unknown territory. Our archaeologists are surprised when he leads us directly to an ancient ruin. We were able to find some artifacts for our museum to ensure." #NT!

 lepsius.432.d: "A local wants to sell us an artifact." #NT!
 lepsius.432.f: "Our expedition stops in a larger city. When the porters bought feed for the beasts of burden, a trader spoke up. Apparently, the news about our trip has also spread widely among the locals. For a good price he is willing to sell a valuable piece of art he got from a grave robber. The origin of the artifact is unclear, but the offer is attractive - even if it comes at a price." #NT!

 lepsius.433.d: "An antiques dealer with a questionable reputation wants to sell us an artifact." #NT!
 lepsius.433.f: "Not all dealers of supposedly valuable archaeological artifacts are trustworthy. This applies, for example, to a trader who, somewhat overzealously, wants to sell us an art treasure. The encroachment and its flexible price mechanism, which supposedly promises us a 'friendly price', have raised doubts among our expedition leaders as to whether this is really a safe offer. That's why they asked the museum whether they should accept the artifact from the dodgy hands of the dealer." #NT!

 lepsius.434.d: "Our expedition captured a group of tomb robbers and their loot, but we're undecided on what to do with them." #NT!
 lepsius.434.f: "Our archaeologists thought they had already found a good excavation site, until realizing that the site had been plundered for centuries. As they repacked their things, a couple of campfire wardens were able to apprehend several shady characters attempting to smuggle an artifact out of the abandoned site. Actually, we should hand the men over to the authorities and return the stolen piece of art. However, some people think we should claim the artifact for ourselves and buy the grave robbers' silence." #NT!

 lepsius.434.h: "File a complaint and return the artifact to local authorities." #NT!
 lepsius.435.t: "Auction" #NT!
 lepsius.435.d: "Political pressure prompts us to consider selling a recently found artifact." #NT!
 lepsius.435.f: "There are fears among some members of the government that our overseas archaeological ventures are nothing but a waste of money, sacrificing our nation's economic output for the elite ivory towers of a small clique of scientists. They not only want scientific results, but also monetary proof that these expeditions make sense. A group of politicians are therefore demanding that a recently found artifact be sold to cover the expenses caused by our archaeological adventures." #NT!

 lepsius.436.d: "Our archaeologists found a tomb, seemingly plundered by raiders. But when they made further investigations, they found a chamber behind a false wall." #NT!
 lepsius.436.f: "The last stop started with a disappointment. Our expedition leader had expected a lot from the historical site: it was the grave of a high official of the nobility, perhaps also with a sacred function. In any case, the information from some farmers suggested that this was the case. The disappointment on site is all the greater: the tomb is empty, the walls are bare, and there is not even a sign of any historical significance. At first glance, it looked like just a smooth-hewn cave. However, this changed abruptly when the research assistant accidentally discovered the outline of a door frame as he leaned against the supposed wall. It took two hours to uncover debris, shutters and rocks - and reveal access to a previously hidden chamber." #NT!

 lepsius.437.d: "We found the abandoned camp of a foreign excavation team. After we secured two artifacts there, the country's ambassador claims the pieces for himself." #NT!
 lepsius.437.f: "When our men reached the excavation camp, they were examining the remains of an expedition that had been exploring a nearby temple just a few months earlier. As it turned out, the excavation workers cleared the area a little too quickly: two artifacts that had not been picked up were found in a box. Our archaeologists secured the find, but were soon visited by the country's ambassador, who reclaimed the artifacts found by his country. The case has sparked a diplomatic incident with a great power." #NT!

In many respects even the scholars of our expedition are amazed at his knowledge. The grumpy old man would like to tell us more, but there's no way he's going to give up the artifact. Apparently we have to use force." #NT!

 lepsius.439.f: "During an excavation, our guide comes to the conclusion that a passage may be hidden behind a wall; at least he claims to have spotted a cavity behind the wall. Drastic measures were the order of the day in the early days of archaeology, and this included the use of explosives to further its higher scientific goals. Of course, we could get away with nothing if the alleged hollow space is a deception and we jeopardize the previously secured excavation site." #NT!

 lepsius.440.f: "During an excavation, archaeologists have found a valuable art treasure - at least part of it. The other piece turns out to be in the hands of a minor power who bought it from an antiques dealer a few years ago. We could use our diplomatic service to get the missing piece and assemble the artifact, but the ambassador has already made it clear that doing so would be a political commitment." #NT!

Judging by their appearance, they are a cat, a dog and a monkey. A discussion has flared up among scientists after a find: the mummified animals could shed light on their husbandry and the lives of domestic animals in ancient Egypt, but at the same time mean the destruction of these rare artifacts." #NT!

They pay special attention to the Nile crocodile, which the academics encounter with fear and disgust as well as fascination. At the request of our scientists, our military attaché killed a crocodile. Now, however, he refuses to hand over the animal: he would rather have it stuffed and hang it over his chimney." #NT!

Just a few days later, a mysterious illness afflicted almost all of the participants. A research assistant who was present at the unveiling of the mummy died. A day later, a sandstorm made work impossible for a week. This morning the water supplies turned out to be contaminated and undrinkable; it shimmers in a copper-yellow color.

The walls were finished in glazed bricks mostly in blue, with animals and deities in low relief at intervals, these also made up of bricks that are molded and colored differently.

Marduk, the national deity and chief god, with his servant dragon Mušḫuššu. is depicted as a dragon with a snake-like head and tail, a scaled body of a lion, and powerful talons for back feet. Marduk was seen as the divine champion of good against evil, and the incantations of the Babylonians often sought his protection. The second god shown in the pattern of reliefs on the Ishtar Gate is Adad (also known as Ishkur), whose sacred animal was the aurochs, a now-extinct ancestor of cattle. Adad had power over destructive storms and beneficial rain. The design of the Ishtar Gate also includes linear borders and patterns of rosettes, often seen as symbols of fertility.

As I had foretold, the water failed entirely by the end of the first day's retrograde march. Our fluid aliment was now nothing but gin; but this infernal fluid burned my throat, and I could not even endure the sight of it. I found the temperature and the air stifling. Fatigue paralysed my limbs. More than once I dropped down motionless. Then there was a halt; and my uncle and the Icelander did their best to restore me. But I saw that the former was struggling painfully against excessive fatigue and the tortures of thirst.  We arrived on our hands and knees, and half dead, at the junction of the two roads.

But when we followed it and came to its end, an even greater surprise awaited us. At first I could hardly see anything. My eyes, unaccustomed to the light, quickly closed. When I was able to reopen them, I stood more stupefied even than surprised.  A vast sheet of water, the commencement of a lake or an ocean, spread far away beyond the range of the eye, reminding me forcibly of that open sea which drew from Xenophon's ten thousand Greeks, after their long retreat, the simultaneous cry, "Thalatta! thalatta!" the sea! the sea! The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine shining sand, softly lapped by the waves, and strewn with the small shells which had been inhabited by the first of created beings. The waves broke on this shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to vast inclosed spaces.  It was quite an ocean, with the irregular shores of earth, but desert and frightfully wild in appearance.

They were gigantic animals; it was a herd of mastodons - not fossil remains, but living and resembling those the bones of which were found in the marshes of Ohio in 1801. I saw those huge elephants whose long, flexible trunks were grouting and turning up the soil under the trees like a legion of serpents. I could hear the crashing noise of their long ivory tusks boring into the old decaying trunks. I looked, shaking my head incredulously. But though at first I was unbelieving I had to yield to the evidence of my senses. In fact, at a distance of a quarter of a mile, leaning against the trunk of a gigantic kauri, stood a human being, the Proteus of those subterranean regions, a new son of Neptune, watching this countless herd of mastodons. Yes, truly, huger still himself. It was no longer a fossil being like him whose dried remains we had easily lifted up in the field of bones; it was a giant, able to control those monsters. In stature he was at least twelve feet high. His head, huge and unshapely as a buffalo's, was half hidden in the thick and tangled growth of his unkempt hair. It most resembled the mane of the primitive elephant. In his hand he wielded with ease an enormous bough, a staff worthy of this shepherd of the geologic period." #NT!

And yet, now that I can reflect quietly, now that my spirit has grown calm again, now that months have slipped by since this strange and supernatural meeting, what am I to think? what am I to believe? I must conclude that it was impossible that our senses had been deceived, that our eyes did not see what we supposed they saw. No human being lives in this subterranean world; no generation of men dwells in those inferior caverns of the globe, unknown to and unconnected with the inhabitants of its surface. It is absurd to believe it! I had rather admit that it may have been some animal whose structure resembled the human, some ape or baboon of the early geological ages, some protopitheca, or some mesopitheca, some early or middle ape like that discovered by Mr. Lartet in the bone cave of Sansau. But this creature surpassed in stature all the measurements known in modern palæontology. But that a man, a living man, and therefore whole generations doubtless besides, should be buried there in the bowels of the earth, is impossible. However, we had left behind us the luminous forest, dumb with astonishment, overwhelmed and struck down with a terror which amounted to stupefaction. We kept running on for fear the horrible monster might be on our track. It was a flight, a fall, like that fearful pulling and dragging which is peculiar to nightmare. And, wonderfully interested, we peered all along the high wall, peeping into every fissure which might open out into a gallery. There, upon a granite slab, appeared two mysterious graven letters, half eaten away by time. They were the initials of the bold and daring traveller: 'A. S.,' shouted my uncle. 'Arne Saknussemm!

At last I failed utterly; I uttered a cry and fell. 'Come to me, I am dying.' My uncle retraced his steps. He gazed upon me with his arms crossed; then these muttered words passed his lips: 'It's all over!' The last thing I saw was a fearful gesture of rage, and my eyes closed. " #NT!

It rocked upon the lava torrent, amidst a dense fall of ashes. Snorting flames darted their fiery tongues at us. There were wild, fierce puffs of stormy wind from below, resembling the blasts of vast iron furnaces blowing all at one time; and I caught a glimpse of the figure of Hans lighted up by the fire; and all the feeling I had left was just what I imagine must be the feeling of an unhappy criminal doomed to be blown away alive from the mouth of a cannon, just before the trigger is pulled, and the flying limbs and rags of flesh and skin fill the quivering air and spatter the blood-stained ground. \n\n When I opened my eyes again I felt myself grasped by the belt with the strong hand of our guide. I found myself lying on the sloping side of a mountain only two yards from a gaping gulf, which would have swallowed me up had I leaned at all that way. Above our heads, at a height of five hundred feet or more, we saw the crater of a volcano, through which, at intervals of fifteen minutes or so, there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire, mingled with pumice stones, ashes, and flowing lava. I could feel the heaving of the mountain, which seemed to breathe like a huge whale, and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes. Beneath, down a pretty steep declivity, ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred feet, giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet. But the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich verdure, amongst which I was able to distinguish the olive, the fig, and vines, covered with their luscious purple bunches." #NT!

Bearing the likeness of Osiris, Egyptian god of the afterlife, it is 54 centimetres tall, weighs over 10 kilograms or 321.5 troy ounces, and is decorated with semi-precious stones.

Theories suggest she could have been an Egyptian royal by birth, a foreign princess or the daughter of a high government official named Ay, who became pharaoh after Tutankhamun. She may have been the co-regent of Egypt with Akhenaten, who ruled from 1352 BCE to 1336 BCE.

It contains some of the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions ever found. The tablet is thought by some to depict the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the king Narmer. Along with the Scorpion Macehead and the Narmer Maceheads, also found together in the main deposit at Nekhen, the Narmer Palette provides one of the earliest known depictions of an Egyptian king. The Palette shows many of the classic conventions of Ancient Egyptian art, which must already have been formalized by the time of the Palette's creation.

The intricate curling and patterning of the beard and the complex hairstyle suggests royalty, power, and wealth from an ideal male in society. Aside from its aesthetic traits, this piece is spectacular because it is the earliest hollow-cast sculpture item known to use the lost-wax casting process.  There is deliberate damage on the left side of the face and eye, indicating that the bust was intentionally slashed at a later period to demonstrate political iconoclasm." #NT!

The helmet was embossed in gold sheet and was therefore hardly suitable as protective clothing for war. It may have been used more in the ceremonial/cultic area. Apart from the ears worked out on the sides, the work as a whole is more like a wig, as its fine engravings imitate a wavy hairstyle. On the side, on the other hand, there are curls that are separated from the wavy hairstyle by a braid around the head. The braid is knotted into a button at the end of the head. The helmet has a series of small holes on the edge, to which a lining was probably attached." #NT!

German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, who discovered the artifact in 1876, believed that he had found the body of the Mycenaean king Agamemnon, leader of the Achaeans in Homer's epic of the Trojan War, the Iliad, but modern archaeological research suggests that the mask dates to about 1600 BC, pre-dating the period of the legendary Trojan War by 300-400 years. The mask is made of yellow-reddish, strong gold sheet and has a height of about 26 cm and a width of 26.5 cm. The face of a man with a beard, mustache and eyebrows is embossed into the sheet metal. There is a hole next to each earlobe, which was probably used for attachment. The mask has been described by Cathy Gere as the 'Mona Lisa of prehistory'." #NT!

The disc was discovered in 1908 by the Italian archaeologist Luigi Pernier in the Minoan palace-site of Phaistos, and features 241 tokens, comprising 45 distinct signs, which were apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic 'seals' into a disc of soft clay, in a clockwise sequence spiralling toward the center of the disk.

The Knossos figurines, both significantly incomplete, date to near the end of the neo-palatial period of Minoan civilization, around 1600 BCE. It was Evans who called the larger of his pair of figurines a 'Snake Goddess', the smaller a 'Snake Priestess'; since then, it has been debated whether Evans was right, or whether both figurines depict priestesses, or both depict the same deity or distinct deities. The combination of elaborate clothes that leave the breasts completely bare, and 'snake-wrangling', attracted considerable publicity, not to mention various fakes, and the smaller figure in particular remains a popular icon for Minoan art and religion, now also generally referred to as a 'Snake Goddess'." #NT!

Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king Pakal, covered with irregularly-shaped marble plaques and having eyes made from mother-of-pearl and obsidian. Pacal the Great was ajaw of the Maya city-state of Palenque in the Late Classic period of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican chronology. He acceded to the throne in July 615 and ruled until his death.

This form of mortuary architecture was in use in the Late Bronze Age in the areas under the cultural influence of the Aegean.

The decisive moment had arrived. With trembling hands I made a tiny breach in the upper left hand corner. Darkness and blank space, as far as an iron testing-rod could reach, showed that whatever lay beyond was empty, and not filled like the passage we had just cleared. Candle tests were applied as a precaution against possible foul gases, and then, widening the hole a little, I inserted the candle and peered in. At first I could see nothing, the hot air escaping from the chamber causing the candle flame to flicker, but presently, as my eyes grew accustomed to the light, details of the room within emerged slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues, and gold - everywhere the glint of gold. For the moment - an eternity it must have seemed to the others standing by - I was struck dumb with amazement, and when my colleague, unable to stand the suspense any longer, inquired anxiously, 'Can you see anything?' it was all I could do to get out the words, 'Yes, wonderful things.'" #NT!

He kept on cutting and cutting. Time meant nothing. He was not conscious of being tired, or of lying in a perpendicular position. He probed. He cut. Suddenly and miraculously his hands were through into nothingness. He lay as if in a trance. He closed his eyes. An almost imperceptible smell crept into his nostrils. He could not define what it was. It was almost sweet. It could not be incense. Or was it? Was it perhaps the very smell of history? Then he knew. It was cedar wood! His eyes were still unopened. He drew a deep breath and determined that it was indeed cedar wood. He felt a sense of fulfillment such as he had never known before. Happiness tingled through him. His eyes were still closed. He whispered a prayer of thanks to God. His questioning mind began to function again. If indeed he smelt cedar wood from a Solar Boat below it did not mean that the white ant had not been busy.

But our 'Sachn' is nothing other than the present-day appearance of the ancient sacred precinct, in which the Zikurrat Etemenanki, the 'Foundation Stone of Heaven and Earth', the tower of Babylon, rose, surrounded by a ring wall to which all kinds of buildings related to the cult. We do not know the full height of the tower. But Nabupolassar, like Nebuchadnezzar, puts special emphasis on them in his cylinder inscription from Etemenanki. The former says: 'At that time Marduk commanded me... the tower of Babylon, which had been weakened and brought down in the days before me, to set its foundation firmly on the breast of the underworld, while its top aspire to heaven.'" #NT!

 lepsius.931.f: "Were the Hanging Gardens really in Babylon? According to the latest discovery, this claim has been proven to be false. Indeed, comparing historical sources, our most able archaeologists have found that very few sources place the legendary Gardens in Babylon. Furthermore, it was the Assyrians, not the Babylonians, who were known for their sophisticated gardening techniques. Reliefs bear witness to extensive gardens on several floors. An archaeological team has taken this as an opportunity to carry out test excavations at the great palace of the Assyrian king Sennacherib in a part that was thought to be little explored. The finding is clear: the lost wonder of the world was clearly in Nineveh. Our archaeologists therefore benefit not only from the discovery, but also from the clarification of a mystery that has lasted for two and a half millennia." #NT!

 lepsius.941.f: "By far the most important and worthwhile excavation was the one directly behind the Lion's Gate. During his test excavations in 1874, Schliemann had already established that the rock at the lowest point of the castle was covered deepest with rubble. According to the words of Pausanias, he considered it likely that the graves of the ruling family were within the castle wall and had to remember the words when, soon after the start of the work, three tombstones with ancient reliefs were found at a depth of 3 to 5 meters. When the stones were removed, says Schliemann, it turned out that they were not standing on the ground, as previously assumed, but on earth that filled the shafts that had been driven vertically into the rock to make the graves. They dug into five such shafts, and after layers of stone had been removed at a certain depth, which had served as altars after the burial of the dead victims, the ax struck the ground about 6 meters deep. On the bottom lay fifteen corpses spread out in the five graves, adorned with rich, one might say fabulous, gold jewellery. Golden masks, imitating the features of the deceased, lay over the faces of the men, golden plates, richly decorated with spirals, covered their breasts, the robes of the women were laden with gold." #NT!
