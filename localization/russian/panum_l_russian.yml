 panum.100.f: "Cholera, endemic to East Asia, probably occurred in the Indian subcontinent over several centuries in the form of localized epidemics, but was unknown on other continents. The first pandemic occurred between 1817 and 1824 and affected parts of Asia as well as East Africa and Asia Minor and subsequently Russia and Europe. In 1830 it appeared in Eastern Galicia and Hungary, and in June 1831 in Vienna. It overwhelmed the world in a total of six pandemics and became the scourge of the emerging industrial society. Although most infections (around 85 percent) are asymptomatic, the mortality rate at the beginning is between 20 and 70 percent, if the disease is left untreated." #NT!

 panum.103.f: "The first case of cholera occurred last week in a water mill on the outskirts of the city. Although the building was quarantined, there were further incidents further downstream in several manufactories.

A lot of bribes were paid to circumvent quarantine regulations. The common people view this development with contempt." #NT!
 panum.105.f: "One of the characteristics of cholera was that it killed both rich and poor alike, making it like the plague of the Middle Ages. The influential and rich families therefore tried their best to avoid the plague. The aristocracy saw cholera as a kind of 'revolutionary disease' because it made no distinction between classes. The lax measures towards the upper class made cholera a political issue due to these social conflicts. It has often been stated that the cholera epidemics of the early 1830s in Europe and the revolutionary movements stood in a context." #NT!

 panum.107.f: "In the wake of mass deaths and possible risks of infection, the mass burial of the dead became an unavoidable phenomenon.

 panum.108.f: "The construction of mass hospitalizations during epidemics such as cholera or tuberculosis was often controversial. The families preferred to care for their sick people at home instead of giving them away into anonymity, where they were crammed into a small space with other sick people, which is why many were convinced that they would get sick and die there. The accusation circulated that it was primarily a measure to isolate the poor from the rich and thus protect the latter." #NT!

In the latter case, 114,683 people officially died of cholera. A cholera outbreak in London in 1848/1849 was far more serious than the cholera outbreak in 1832/1832. During this outbreak, 15,000 people died in London, more than 0.5 percent of a city population at the time of about 2.5 million. In the first week of September 1849, 300 people died per day. In the third pandemic between 1852 and 1860, around a million people died in Russia, which was facilitated by the Crimean War that was taking place at the same time. The British commander-in-chief, Lord Raglan, and the commander of the French fleet, Armand Joseph Bruat, died of the disease. It is believed that more people died from cholera than from fighting." #NT!

 panum.200.f: "In the early Middle Ages, tuberculosis played a minor role in Europe due to the sparse population. It was only more strongly represented in the few metropolitan areas. After a previous outbreak in Italy in the second half of the 15th century, the largest and longest wave of tuberculosis in history began in the 17th century. Tuberculosis gained widespread interest in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the endemic disease of the urban poor. In 1815 a quarter of deaths in England and in 1918 in France a sixth of deaths were caused by tuberculosis. Around 1880, every second death in Germany in the 15 to 40 age group was due to this disease. Tuberculosis was also the most common cause of death in rural areas." #NT!

 panum.300.f: "Smallpox has probably been known for thousands of years and appeared in the first settlements in northeast Africa 12,000 years ago. From there they may have been brought to India by Egyptian traders. The European conquerors brought smallpox with them to America, where it caused devastating epidemics among the Indians starting in 1518, causing millions of deaths. In Europe, smallpox was sometimes considered a childhood disease, and the disease, from which up to 10% of all small children died until the end of the 18th century, was also called “children's disease”. From the 18th century onwards, cases of smallpox increased and replaced the plague as the worst disease. It is estimated that 400,000 people died of smallpox each year, and a third of those who survived went blind. Often children were only considered part of the family once they had survived smallpox. Despite the successful introduction of smallpox vaccination around 1800, smallpox remained an epidemic disease until the second half of the century." #NT!

 panum.400.f: "Typhus fever, which probably existed in ancient times but was only reliably described in the 16th century, appeared primarily as a typical epidemic of war and misery. Typhus became a serious problem for Napoleon's army during the Russian campaign. When the Grande Armée, which had moved to Russia in June 1812, withdrew in the fall of 1813, Mainz was the first stop on French soil. 15,000-17,000 French crew and just as many civilians died there. The disease, which was then also called “nervous fever” because of the neurological symptoms it caused, remained in the French language as Typhus de Mayence. By the end of October 1814, 14,000 cases of typhus had been recorded in the Franconian area around the Grand Duchy of Würzburg, of which 2,500 were fatal. Another epidemic with around two and a half million deaths occurred as a result of war and civil war between 1918 and 1922 in Russia." #NT!
