For many tribes, the arrival of the missionaries marked a first step towards centralization.

The excitement from the novelty of objects, and the chance of success, stimulate him to increased activity. Moreover as a number of isolated facts soon become uninteresting, the habit of comparison leads to generalization. On the other hand, as the traveller stays but a short space of time in each place, his descriptions must generally consist of mere sketches, instead of detailed observation. Hence arises, as I have found to my cost, a constant tendency to fill up the wide gaps of knowledge, by inaccurate and superficial hypotheses.' -Charles Darwin" #NT!

To determine the geomagnetic parameters on land, stations were usually set up where the solid subsoil was formed by 'bricks' brought along.

On the other hand, physical and biological theories should be verified. For a long time there was the assumption that no living beings could exist beyond a certain water depth or that 'living fossils' would have been preserved there. Scientists like C.W. Tomson believed that the conditions of constant cold temperature, darkness, and lack of currents, waves, or seismic events provided such a stable environment that evolution would slow or stop entirely.

When I recollect, the fact that the form of the body, shape of scales & general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce, from which Island any Tortoise may have been brought. When I see these Islands in sight of each other, &  possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure & filling the same place in Nature, I must suspect they are only varieties. The only fact of a similar kind of which I am aware, is the constant asserted difference - between the wolf-like Fox of East & West Falkland Islands. If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks the zoology of Archipelagoes - will be well worth examining; for such facts would undermine the stability of Species.' -Charles Darwin" #NT!

The oldest known fossils are mostly stromatolites, and they could therefore provide clues as to how life evolved from very simple to more complex forms. Stromatolites are considered to be the first recognizable structures built up by organisms. They originated in the Precambrian, up to 3.5 billion years ago. 3.45 billion years old is the Warrawoona series, found at the North Pole site in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. In some periods of the earth's history - long before corals existed - the stromatolite builders were important reef builders. Up until a billion years ago, stromatolites were widespread in almost all coastal waters. 700 million years ago, the diversity and distribution of stromatolites declined.

The finds from Java were first referred to as Anthropopithecus and later as Pithecanthropus erectus. Today they are assigned to the species Homo erectus by most paleoanthropologists, whereby their origin is occasionally - as suggested by Franz Weidenreich in 1940 - emphasized by the addition of a subspecies epithet: Homo erectus javanensis.
