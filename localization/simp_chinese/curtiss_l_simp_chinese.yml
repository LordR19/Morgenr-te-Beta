Word of the 'aerostatic machines' quickly spread throughout Europe. The first military use of aircraft took place during the French Revolutionary Wars, when the French used a tethered hydrogen balloon to observe the movements of the Austrian army during the Battle of Fleurus (1794)." #NT!

In 1860, Paul Reuter used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and Aachen, the terminus of early telegraph lines. During the Franco-Prussian War pigeons were used to carry mail between defeated Paris and the French unoccupied territory. In December 1870, it took ten hours for a pigeon carrying microfilms to fly from Perpignan to Brussels." #NT!

 curtiss_early_aviation_tech_desc: "Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed heavier-than-air flight. He was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful gliding flights. Lilienthal's work led to him developing the concept of the modern wing, which heavily inspired further development. The American Wright brothers flights in 1903 are recognized as 'the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight'." #NT!

Fabre's first successful take off and landing by a powered seaplane inspired other aviators. The first hydro-aeroplane competition was held in Monaco in March 1912, featuring aircraft using floats from Fabre, Curtiss, Tellier and Farman. The French Navy ordered its first floatplane in the same year." #NT!

It was founded mainly on the initiative of the aeronaut and later general secretary of the society, Walther Bruns. The founding president in 1924 was Fridtjof Nansen. After several years of preparatory work, the company succeeded in 1931 in using an airship for a purely scientific polar expedition for the first time. Through the Arctic flight of the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, knowledge of the geography of the polar regions flown over was significantly expanded. As early as 1926 Umberto Nobile flew over the North Pole with his airship 'Norge' and later undertook an expedition with the 'Italia'." #NT!

 je_curtiss_found_schneider_trophy_reason: "Jacques Schneider was a French industrial manager, licensed plane and balloon pilot, and, for a long time, held the balloon altitude record. Deprived of flying due to a serious accident, he supported various competitions and aero clubs financially. As race referee at the Monaco meeting in 1912, he noticed that seaplane design was lagging far behind other aircraft. Since seaplanes promised to be the best solution for long-range passenger service, Mr. Schneider thought that a seaplane race would allow these aircraft to improve more quickly." #NT!

 curtiss.12.f: "Henri Fabre was an engineer who studied the airplanes of Louis Blériot and Gabriel Voisin. He then decided in 1909 to start building the first prototype seaplane. Fabre invested a lot of time in the construction of the floats. This knowledge later helped him to equip foreign aircraft types with floats. However, the prototype only had a weak 18 kW (25 hp) engine and therefore did not fly. The next machine received a powerful 37 kW (50 hp) Gnôme radial engine. He named the plane 'Hydravion' (seaplane). On March 28, 1910, the launch attempts began over the Étang de Berre at Martigues near Marseille. The second launch was successful and the plane flew around 600 m. The next day it was even 6 km. The filigree Hydravion proved to be very stable. After a crash on landing, the plane was overhauled. In April 1911, the new version started with the pilot Jean Bécue in Monaco. Henri Fabre was soon contacted by Glenn Curtiss and Gabriel Voisin who used his invention to develop their own seaplanes. Fabre died at the Methuselah age of 101 in 1984 and was one of the last living aviation pioneers. As late as 1971, Fabre said he was still sailing his own boat single-handedly in Marseille harbour." #NT!

The flight was considered proof that flying boats had become a reliable means of long-distance transport. n the 1930s, flying boats made it possible to have regular air transport between the U.S. and Europe, opening up new air travel routes to South America, Africa, and Asia. Foynes, Ireland and Botwood, Newfoundland and Labrador were the terminals for many early transatlantic flights. In areas where there were no airfields for land-based aircraft, flying boats could stop at small river, lake or coastal stations to refuel and resupply. The Pan Am Boeing 314 'Clipper' flying boats brought new exotic destinations like the Far East within reach and came to represent the romance of flight." #NT!

The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun (helios). On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth. After an oil drilling operation in 1903 in Kansas produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas. With further analysis, Hamilton Cady and David McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas. Although the extraction process using low-temperature gas liquefaction was not developed in time to be significant during World War I, production continued.

The most important features of Zeppelin's design were the rigid aluminum frame made up of rings and longitudinal members, the firm connection of the two gondolas to the frame, the division of the gas space into cylindrical cells of equal size, and the attachment of propellers at the height of the air resistance centre. The airships were called zeppelins. Zeppelin's ideas continued to be largely rejected and ridiculed by experts and the general public; Kaiser Wilhelm II described the count as the 'stupidest of all southern Germans'. During this time, Zeppelin said: 'Of course nobody stands up for me, because nobody wants to take the leap into the dark. But my goal is clear and my calculations are correct'. In 1900, the LZ 1 made three ascents over Lake Constance, with Zeppelin's technical manager being the engineer Fritz Burr.

In 1917, the German LZ 104 (L 59) was the first airship to make an intercontinental flight, from Jambol in Bulgaria to Khartoum and back, a nonstop journey of 6,800 kilometres (4,200 mi; 3,700 nmi). During and just after the war, Britain and the United States built airships, and France and Italy experimented with confiscated German ones. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin delivered LZ 126 to the US Navy as a war reparation in October 1924. The company chairman Dr. Hugo Eckener commanded the delivery flight, and the ship was commissioned as the USS Los Angeles (ZR-3). During 1925, the Versailles restrictions were relaxed by the Allies, enabling Dr Hugo Eckener, the chairman of Zeppelin Luftschiffbau, to pursue his vision of developing a zeppelin suitable for launching an intercontinental air passenger service. Accordingly, Zeppelin Lufftschiffbau began construction of the first of a new generation of airships, the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin. On 18 September 1928, the completed airship flew for the first time.
