After the discovery of the monumental inscription of Behistun, which contained older languages ​​of Mesopotamia in addition to the now well-known Persian, it was only a matter of time before Elamite, Babylonian and Akkadian would be understandable again after centuries.

The boat threatens to tip into the Nile as the expedition's members pile up at the railing, glancing at the silhouette of the city known in ancient Egypt as Thebes. Ruins of millennia-old structures line the banks of the Nile, obelisks rise up between dilapidated houses and tents. On the other bank of the Nile, however, rise the sandy-brown mountain ranges where the legendary Valley of the Kings is hidden, and where it is said that there are still unknown tombs of the pharaohs. But before we can get to that, we still have a few things to settle in Luxor..." #NT!
 lepsius.200.f_ex_loe: "The 'Mother of the World' lies above the waters of the Nile glittering in the sun. Minarets and domes adorn the panorama and tell of the power and importance of this city, which once and now helped determine the fate of the Middle East. Colorful bazaars and carpets characterize the streets as well as the fine ornamentation of Fatimid architecture. But the view goes further - far beyond, where the tops of the pyramids herald a bygone era, which is the real goal of our journey. But before that, we have to take a few precautions in Cairo." #NT!
 lepsius.200.f_ex_bab: "Baghdad, Mesopotamia's largest city, is bustling with activity. Like Cairo, it is a center of the Arab world; like Cairo, it was the seat of power and prestige. But unlike Cairo, where the distant pyramids of Giza herald an even older world, there is little in Baghdad that evokes the empires of Babylon and Akkad. Even the alleged antiques that a somewhat careless expedition member bought from a shady dealer have turned out to be fakes. While the stone buildings of the Egyptians and Maya still bear witness to the lost civilizations, there is hardly anything comparable here. We'll probably have to start from scratch." #NT!
 lepsius.200.f_ex_ass: "What else can be found in Assyria after Layard dug at Nimrud? Quite a lot, according to a trader in Mosul. Only a month ago, the head of a lamassu emerged from the sand. And the bazaar always offers good pieces, he tells us. The fact that a whole series of pieces could not be salvaged also has to do with the Kurdish clans in the area, who do not allow everyone to poach in their areas - regardless of excavation license. We'll take the warning with us - and get the essentials before we start the journey." #NT!

Greece does not have many large cities, so our expedition team has little choice but to make the most necessary preparations there before setting off into the countryside. Our archeology guide pushes us hard, as some scholars spend far too much time on distractions—whether it's classic marble or Greek wine. The warm sun, the shade of olive trees and the Akkadian idyll invite to linger and relax - some seem to have already forgotten why we are really here." #NT!

Old-time Venetian bastions salute, reminiscent of times when Candia was a trading hub in the Middle Ages. After the cargo is unloaded to the croaking of seagulls and the participants go ashore, the friendly reception is followed by bitter reality. While some participants complain about the local cuisine and demand better accommodation, the lead archaeologist has little sympathy for such less intellectual requests. Because Heraklion is only a way station for him - the treasures of the Minoans await in the interior of the island." #NT!
 lepsius.200.f_ex_yuc: "In Mérida, our excavation team is making the final preparations before the big departure. The traces of Spanish conquest and colonization characterize the city, which despite its manageable size shows that it was once, together with Campeche, the place from which the Spanish exercised control of the peninsula.

 lepsius.403.f: "The crew of our expedition in the Andes grumbles about the military attaché. On several occasions he has led the group in the wrong direction in search of an ancient Inca site. Recently it even happened that in his ambition to reach the goal as quickly as possible he didn't count on the fog in the mountains. The expedition lost important time because of this.

 lepsius.404.f_aegean: "Greece and Crete are known for their rugged landscapes. As our expedition reaches a gorge, it turns out that a bridge pier has been swept away in a recent landslide. We are faced with the decision of whether to repair the bridge and aim for our original goal, or go to another location. The latter option is quicker and less expensive, but probably crowned with less archaeological success." #NT!
 lepsius.404.f_peru: "After an arduous climb over Andean passes and narrow mountainside roads, our archaeological expedition is faced with an unexpected problem. A suspension bridge that locals say leads to a temple shrouded in legend has been completely destroyed. Some expedition members urge abandoning the quest and heading to an easier archeological site - but locals urge it would be worth the effort. However, if we want to rebuild the bridge, it would cost us time and money." #NT!

In particular, the side roads and paths off the main trade routes are in remarkably poor condition. But the potential destinations of our journey are far away from the centers of civilization. The journey is difficult and some expedition members are already complaining that we should have taken a different route." #NT!
 lepsius.405.f_yucatan: "The jungles of Yucatán are still undeveloped even in these modern times. This makes them worthwhile archeological destinations, as many ruins have not been closely examined by humans for centuries. On the other hand, the journey is full of hardships. Except for a few well-trodden forest paths, there are almost no roads. Expedition members are already complaining about the decision to take this route." #NT!

The majority of our expedition team blames our captain for overlooking a shoal. However, he defended himself by saying that he wanted to end the trip quickly and that the reef was not listed on any map. There's a growing consensus among men that with the current leader, our chances of success are diminishing." #NT!

To their great surprise, however, they found that there was an oasis on the way: palm trees with fat dates and fig trees with sweet fruits awaited them.

 lepsius.408.f: "A nazar is an amulet meant to protect against the evil eye. Such a superstition exists in large parts of the Orient, but also in parts of the Mediterranean. Of course, it would be absurd to think that a scientifically trained mind could protect itself with a talisman to keep evil forces from wreaking havoc on the expedition. The situation is different with the local helpers and porters. They ask the leader to get one of the amulets, convinced that otherwise he will face great misfortune. Whatever the nazar's abilities, if it doesn't affect the expedition then at least affect the morale of our minions." #NT!

Instead of going the long way around, some Greek fishermen offered to take us across the bay. The expedition leader quickly accepted the offer. In a conversation with the fishermen, he was also able to obtain important information about a ruin not far away, which probably dates from pre-classic times." #NT!

 lepsius.410.f_yucatan: "The forests of the Yucatán are full of dangers: jaguars, snakes and poisonous insects lurk in the bushes. At the same time, the expedition members are fascinated by the flora and fauna - in particular by a small, colorful parrot that flies away over hats and helmets and does not leave the travelers' side. The bird appears extremely clever and can now even be fed regularly. The expedition leader has now declared the parrot to be the company's mascot and intends to take it home after the end of the trip." #NT!
 lepsius.410.f_peru: "The condor is the king of the Andes. The huge birds rule the air, their shadow puffs up to unimagined size. Since the beginning of the expedition, he has been looming over the alpacas and porters in a downright menacing manner. The locals don't trust the animal. As a vulture, it is known to circle over cadavers rather than the living. The queasy feeling spreads among some participants." #NT!

While the river has become a torrent, our men continue the journey - until the moment when a cry sounds from the bank. For a moment, our expedition leader can see a colorful bundle being swept away.

 lepsius.421.f: "Unfortunately, during a smaller dig near a mastaba, our excavation team found nothing - with the exception of a small, lapis lazuli blue scarab. The scarab was considered a good luck charm in ancient Egypt. The scarab's behavior of rolling dung balls in front of it related to Re and his journey across the sky on the sun barge. Our expedition leader asked if we could perhaps make a small exception and keep the essentially secondary piece as a souvenir for himself." #NT!

 lepsius.422.f: "At first our men thought it was a dune - but a tiny pinnacle of worked limestone told our archaeologists that the unusual mountain of sand in the Egyptian desert held a secret. Within a few days the expedition uncovered a temple. For some, the result was disappointing because it did not resemble an ancient Egyptian structure, but turned out to be a structure from the time of Alexander the Great. However, experts say that the temple was evidence of the activities of the Greek general in Egypt - whose tomb has not been found to this day." #NT!

 lepsius.423.f: "Hybrid creatures of humans and animals are widespread in the Orient. Our expedition was fortunate to secure an exceptionally beautiful and well-preserved statuette while searching for an excavation site; it's already on its way to our museum . A cuneiform inscription that identifies the being as a temple guard is also revealing. Our archaeologists have theorized that these temple keepers represent a connection to the Israelite cherubim mentioned in the Bible. Two of them also protected the Ark of the Covenant that stood in the Jerusalem Temple." #NT!

 lepsius.424.f: "When our archaeologists examined an ancient city wall on the outskirts of a small town, they actually didn't expect to find a great deal. Only when they felt the stone did they notice that there were cavities in the structure. After a detailed investigation, they broke open the wall at a certain point - as it turned out, cuneiform tablets were built into the wall! The depot is surprisingly well preserved and provides some information about ancient Mesopotamia." #NT!

 lepsius.425.t: "Orichalcum?" #NT!
 lepsius.425.d: "Our archaeologists have found an artifact made from a strange, unknown material." #NT!
 lepsius.425.f: "During one of our Greek expeditions, our archaeologists made a curious discovery. A small bullet arrived at the museum management in the morning. The director didn't understand at first why his men sent him a marble back; under normal circumstances it was just a trivial find. But the amber-colored sphere consists of an unknown material that we have never encountered anywhere else. So far, experts have been at a loss as to what to make of the artifact, with some believing it is a fake. Others claim that this is an indication that our knowledge of the Aegean world is totally inadequate." #NT!

 lepsius.426.d: "Our archaeologists have uncovered numerous Aegean artifacts." #NT!
 lepsius.426.f: "What was rubbish for the ancients is a treasure trove for an archaeologist. This motto has only recently come true when our expedition stopped at a smaller ruin in search of an excavation site, and on closer examination found a pit with a pottery depot. Many of the shards still need to be mended, but the numerous finds will definitely enrich our museum collection." #NT!
 lepsius.426.g: "And it all belongs to us!" #NT!
 lepsius.427.t: "Maya Jade" #NT!
 lepsius.427.d: "Our archaeologists have found valuable Mayan artifacts made of jade." #NT!
 lepsius.427.f: "Jade was a material widely used by the Maya in the fields of art and religion. The elite adorned themselves with jade, and the sun god was also depicted in jade jewellery. However, the peoples of Central America also made tools from jade because it was one of the hardest materials known from the New World. Our archaeologists were lucky enough to find a few such jade artifacts during their last dig." #NT!

 lepsius.428.t: "Inca Idol" #NT!
 lepsius.428.d: "Our archaeologists have unearthed a mysterious golden Inca idol." #NT!
 lepsius.428.f: "A golden statuette of the Inca god Inti arrived at the museum via express delivery this morning. Our archaeologists don't say how or where they got it. A grimace, horrible and beautiful at the same time, looks at the observer. Some experts have already expressed doubts as to whether the piece is of Inca origin at all. The design indicates an unknown culture. In addition, almost all Inca gold was stolen from Peru. It is perhaps the most unique item in our pre-Columbian collection to date. The museum director is already whispering behind closed doors that some legends might be true after all." #NT!

 lepsius.429.d: "Our archaeologists found... something." #NT!
 lepsius.429.f: "A trusted dealer, our excavator swears, recently showed him an extraordinarily interesting, as well as sinister, piece. It is a human skull - made entirely of Mesoamerican quartz. The surface is amazingly well polished and the work surpasses anything we have ever known about the cultures of the South American continent. But the doubts are great. Even our chief archaeologist isn't 100% sure what to make of the artifact." #NT!
 lepsius.429.g: "We add it to the collection." #NT!
 lepsius.429.h: "Definitely a fake." #NT!
 lepsius.430.t: "Fake Crystal Skull" #NT!
 lepsius.430.d: "The alleged artifact that was sold to us years ago as a sensation is actually a fake." #NT!
 lepsius.430.f: "How could that happen? Were we too careless? Too selfish because we rush from sensation to sensation and only believe what we want to believe? The legendary crystal skull that our museum acquired as an attraction years ago is a cheap fake. It will be years before our standing in the archaeological world is restored!" #NT!

 lepsius.431.f: "When our expedition makes a stop in a small town on our route, we meet an elderly farmer who has heard about our destination. In exchange for some bread, salt and water, he is extremely accommodating. 'The other villagers have already told me what you are looking for,' he explains. He takes us half a day's journey through unknown territory. Our archaeologists are surprised when he leads us directly to an ancient ruin. We were able to find some artifacts for our museum to ensure." #NT!

 lepsius.432.d: "A local wants to sell us an artifact." #NT!
 lepsius.432.f: "Our expedition stops in a larger city. When the porters bought feed for the beasts of burden, a trader spoke up. Apparently, the news about our trip has also spread widely among the locals. For a good price he is willing to sell a valuable piece of art he got from a grave robber. The origin of the artifact is unclear, but the offer is attractive - even if it comes at a price." #NT!

 lepsius.433.d: "An antiques dealer with a questionable reputation wants to sell us an artifact." #NT!
 lepsius.433.f: "Not all dealers of supposedly valuable archaeological artifacts are trustworthy. This applies, for example, to a trader who, somewhat overzealously, wants to sell us an art treasure. The encroachment and its flexible price mechanism, which supposedly promises us a 'friendly price', have raised doubts among our expedition leaders as to whether this is really a safe offer. That's why they asked the museum whether they should accept the artifact from the dodgy hands of the dealer." #NT!

 lepsius.434.d: "Our expedition captured a group of tomb robbers and their loot, but we're undecided on what to do with them." #NT!
 lepsius.434.f: "Our archaeologists thought they had already found a good excavation site, until realizing that the site had been plundered for centuries. As they repacked their things, a couple of campfire wardens were able to apprehend several shady characters attempting to smuggle an artifact out of the abandoned site. Actually, we should hand the men over to the authorities and return the stolen piece of art. However, some people think we should claim the artifact for ourselves and buy the grave robbers' silence." #NT!

 lepsius.435.d: "Political pressure prompts us to consider selling a recently found artifact." #NT!
 lepsius.435.f: "There are fears among some members of the government that our overseas archaeological ventures are nothing but a waste of money, sacrificing our nation's economic output for the elite ivory towers of a small clique of scientists. They not only want scientific results, but also monetary proof that these expeditions make sense. A group of politicians are therefore demanding that a recently found artifact be sold to cover the expenses caused by our archaeological adventures." #NT!

 lepsius.436.d: "Our archaeologists found a tomb, seemingly plundered by raiders. But when they made further investigations, they found a chamber behind a false wall." #NT!
 lepsius.436.f: "The last stop started with a disappointment. Our expedition leader had expected a lot from the historical site: it was the grave of a high official of the nobility, perhaps also with a sacred function. In any case, the information from some farmers suggested that this was the case. The disappointment on site is all the greater: the tomb is empty, the walls are bare, and there is not even a sign of any historical significance. At first glance, it looked like just a smooth-hewn cave. However, this changed abruptly when the research assistant accidentally discovered the outline of a door frame as he leaned against the supposed wall. It took two hours to uncover debris, shutters and rocks - and reveal access to a previously hidden chamber." #NT!

 lepsius.437.d: "We found the abandoned camp of a foreign excavation team. After we secured two artifacts there, the country's ambassador claims the pieces for himself." #NT!
 lepsius.437.f: "When our men reached the excavation camp, they were examining the remains of an expedition that had been exploring a nearby temple just a few months earlier. As it turned out, the excavation workers cleared the area a little too quickly: two artifacts that had not been picked up were found in a box. Our archaeologists secured the find, but were soon visited by the country's ambassador, who reclaimed the artifacts found by his country. The case has sparked a diplomatic incident with a great power." #NT!

 lepsius.439.f: "During an excavation, our guide comes to the conclusion that a passage may be hidden behind a wall; at least he claims to have spotted a cavity behind the wall. Drastic measures were the order of the day in the early days of archaeology, and this included the use of explosives to further its higher scientific goals. Of course, we could get away with nothing if the alleged hollow space is a deception and we jeopardize the previously secured excavation site." #NT!

The other piece turns out to be in the hands of a minor power who bought it from an antiques dealer a few years ago. We could use our diplomatic service to get the missing piece and assemble the artifact, but the ambassador has already made it clear that doing so would be a political commitment." #NT!

Marduk was seen as the divine champion of good against evil, and the incantations of the Babylonians often sought his protection. The second god shown in the pattern of reliefs on the Ishtar Gate is Adad (also known as Ishkur), whose sacred animal was the aurochs, a now-extinct ancestor of cattle. Adad had power over destructive storms and beneficial rain. The design of the Ishtar Gate also includes linear borders and patterns of rosettes, often seen as symbols of fertility.

 lepsius.592.f: "He had isolated himself. Isolated from the outside world in order to spend time alone with the Lidenbrock diary. As he was to tell us later, there was one passage that had intrigued him for months. In addition to personal notes, a much older manuscript page was found between the pages. Creator: a 16th-century Icelandic alchemist named Arne Saknussemm. He left a mysterious inscription on runes that turned out to be more difficult to crack than [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_journey_coe_leader').GetFullName] first thought. Then, as if by intuition, he solved the riddle. As it turned out, he was right. The book had a secret; a mystery so great and monstrous that it shook him to the core. Because the alchemist's message was: \n\n 'Go down into the crater of Snaefells Jökull, which Scartaris's shadow caresses just before the calends of July, O daring traveler, and you'll make it to the center of the earth. I've done that.' \n\n What got [SCOPE.sCharacter('lepsius_journey_coe_leader').GetFullName] even more excited: Lidenbrock had added new runes to the text with his own handwriting.

An immense bed of lava bounds it on one side, and falls gently towards the sea. On the other extends the vast bay of Faxa, shut in at the north by the enormous glacier of the Snæfell, and of which the Valkyria was for the time the only occupant. Usually the English and French conservators of fisheries moor in this bay, but just then they were cruising about the western coasts of the island. The longest of the only two streets that Rejkiavik possesses was parallel with the beach. I had soon explored these melancholy ways; here and there I got a glimpse of faded turf, looking like a worn-out bit of carpet, or some appearance of a kitchen garden, the sparse vegetables of which, would have figured appropriately upon a Lilliputian table.

I raised my head and saw straight above me the upper aperture of the cone, framing a bit of sky of very small circumference, but almost perfectly round. Just upon the edge appeared the snowy peak of Saris, standing out sharp and clear against endless space. I had not yet ventured to look down the bottomless pit into which I was about to take a plunge. The supreme hour had come. I have already mentioned that it was a hundred feet in diameter, and three hundred feet round. I bent over a projecting rock and gazed down. My hair stood on end with terror.

Through the beds of schist, coloured with delicate shades of green, ran in winding course threads of copper and manganese, with traces of platinum and gold. I thought, what riches are here buried at an unapproachable depth in the earth, hidden for ever from the covetous eyes of the human race! About six o'clock this brilliant fête of illuminations underwent a sensible abatement of splendour, then almost ceased. As I had foretold, the water failed entirely by the end of the first day's retrograde march. Our fluid aliment was now nothing but gin; but this infernal fluid burned my throat, and I could not even endure the sight of it. I found the temperature and the air stifling.

When I was able to reopen them, I stood more stupefied even than surprised.  A vast sheet of water, the commencement of a lake or an ocean, spread far away beyond the range of the eye, reminding me forcibly of that open sea which drew from Xenophon's ten thousand Greeks, after their long retreat, the simultaneous cry, "Thalatta! thalatta!" the sea! the sea! The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine shining sand, softly lapped by the waves, and strewn with the small shells which had been inhabited by the first of created beings. The waves broke on this shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to vast inclosed spaces.

I saw those huge elephants whose long, flexible trunks were grouting and turning up the soil under the trees like a legion of serpents. I could hear the crashing noise of their long ivory tusks boring into the old decaying trunks. I looked, shaking my head incredulously. But though at first I was unbelieving I had to yield to the evidence of my senses. In fact, at a distance of a quarter of a mile, leaning against the trunk of a gigantic kauri, stood a human being, the Proteus of those subterranean regions, a new son of Neptune, watching this countless herd of mastodons. Yes, truly, huger still himself. It was no longer a fossil being like him whose dried remains we had easily lifted up in the field of bones; it was a giant, able to control those monsters. In stature he was at least twelve feet high. His head, huge and unshapely as a buffalo's, was half hidden in the thick and tangled growth of his unkempt hair.

I must conclude that it was impossible that our senses had been deceived, that our eyes did not see what we supposed they saw. No human being lives in this subterranean world; no generation of men dwells in those inferior caverns of the globe, unknown to and unconnected with the inhabitants of its surface. It is absurd to believe it! I had rather admit that it may have been some animal whose structure resembled the human, some ape or baboon of the early geological ages, some protopitheca, or some mesopitheca, some early or middle ape like that discovered by Mr. Lartet in the bone cave of Sansau. But this creature surpassed in stature all the measurements known in modern palæontology. But that a man, a living man, and therefore whole generations doubtless besides, should be buried there in the bowels of the earth, is impossible. However, we had left behind us the luminous forest, dumb with astonishment, overwhelmed and struck down with a terror which amounted to stupefaction. We kept running on for fear the horrible monster might be on our track. It was a flight, a fall, like that fearful pulling and dragging which is peculiar to nightmare. And, wonderfully interested, we peered all along the high wall, peeping into every fissure which might open out into a gallery.

There were wild, fierce puffs of stormy wind from below, resembling the blasts of vast iron furnaces blowing all at one time; and I caught a glimpse of the figure of Hans lighted up by the fire; and all the feeling I had left was just what I imagine must be the feeling of an unhappy criminal doomed to be blown away alive from the mouth of a cannon, just before the trigger is pulled, and the flying limbs and rags of flesh and skin fill the quivering air and spatter the blood-stained ground. \n\n When I opened my eyes again I felt myself grasped by the belt with the strong hand of our guide. I found myself lying on the sloping side of a mountain only two yards from a gaping gulf, which would have swallowed me up had I leaned at all that way. Above our heads, at a height of five hundred feet or more, we saw the crater of a volcano, through which, at intervals of fifteen minutes or so, there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire, mingled with pumice stones, ashes, and flowing lava. I could feel the heaving of the mountain, which seemed to breathe like a huge whale, and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes. Beneath, down a pretty steep declivity, ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred feet, giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet. But the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich verdure, amongst which I was able to distinguish the olive, the fig, and vines, covered with their luscious purple bunches." #NT!

Apart from the ears worked out on the sides, the work as a whole is more like a wig, as its fine engravings imitate a wavy hairstyle. On the side, on the other hand, there are curls that are separated from the wavy hairstyle by a braid around the head. The braid is knotted into a button at the end of the head.

The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king Pakal, covered with irregularly-shaped marble plaques and having eyes made from mother-of-pearl and obsidian.

When the stones were removed, says Schliemann, it turned out that they were not standing on the ground, as previously assumed, but on earth that filled the shafts that had been driven vertically into the rock to make the graves. They dug into five such shafts, and after layers of stone had been removed at a certain depth, which had served as altars after the burial of the dead victims, the ax struck the ground about 6 meters deep. On the bottom lay fifteen corpses spread out in the five graves, adorned with rich, one might say fabulous, gold jewellery.

With the deciphering of hieroglyphs and the beginning of modern Egyptology, both proponents and critics of the Bible attempted to present evidence that the biblical accounts were false or correct.

However, the decoding of Akkadian revealed that there had been significantly older cultures such as the Sumerians, whose history eclipsed even the Egyptians in terms of age. A whole series of inventions typical of civilization shaped the everyday life of these ancient peoples, and many philologists and archaeologists soon suspected that Babylon was the actual cradle of civilization. The fascination with ancient Mesopotamia soon led to the fact that all areas of civilization were traced back to Babylon: not only the Bible, but also cultures of the Levant and Persia, even the Egyptians, were only mere 'cultural recipients' or 'cultural transmitters' of the original Babylonian culture.

All sciences and arts go back to a primordial wisdom revealed by heaven, according to which property is managed and protected. Panbabylonism aims to provide evidence that this astral worldview left its mark on all cultures and religions in the world.'

In the final analysis, the entire development of the Middle East was culturally strongly influenced by the astronomy and astrology of this original culture, whose ideas were sometimes more, sometimes less obvious." #NT!

Academics did recognize that many of the achievements of the Mesopotamian cultures were part of the core of the intellectual substructure of the Middle East. However, the scientists rejected the claim to absoluteness, even the claim to an 'original culture', in the final declaration. Astronomical research, which was considered the starting point of Babylonian thinking, was exposed as a later development that had been wrongly placed at the beginning. The academics were also unable to recognize a priority of the Babylonian tradition: rather, it turned out that the various 'Babylonian' stories were in fact a common heritage of traditions in the region that the Babylonians actually wrote down first.

However, this simply means that Schliemann found the 'wrong' Troy in the 'right' place. Another layer may actually contain the city that dates back to the time of the Trojan War.

The line of Neanderthals split from that of modern humans but when that occurred is not clear; studies have produced various times ranging from 315,000 to more than 800,000 years ago. Although knowledge and perception of them has markedly changed in the scientific community, the image of the unevolved caveman archetype remains prevalent in popular culture. However, Neanderthal technology was quite sophisticated, including the Mousterian stone-tool industry, the abilities to create fire, build cave hearths, make adhesive birch bark tar, craft at least simple clothes similar to blankets and ponchos, weave, go seafaring through the Mediterranean and make use of medicinal plants.

Its specimens are among the first recognizable members of the genus Homo. H. erectus was the first human ancestor to spread throughout Eurasia, with a continental range extending from the Iberian Peninsula to Java. H. erectus had a more modern gait and body proportions, and was the first human species to have exhibited a flat face, prominent nose, and possibly sparse body hair coverage. Though the species' brain size certainly exceeds that of ancestor species, capacity varied widely depending on the population. H. erectus is credited with inventing the Acheulean stone tool industry, and were the first to make lithic flakes bigger than 10 cm, and hand axes (which includes bifacial tools with only 2 sides, such as picks, knives, and cleavers)." #NT!

The genera Homo (which includes modern humans), Paranthropus, and Kenyanthropus evolved from some Australopithecus species. The earliest known member of the genus, A. anamensis, existed in eastern Africa around 4.2 million years ago. Australopithecus gave rise to living descendants, as the genus Homo emerged from an Australopithecus species at some time between 3 and 2 million years ago.

They lived between approximately 2.9 and 1.2 million years ago (mya) from the end of the Pliocene to the Middle Pleistocene. Paranthropus is characterised by robust skulls, with a prominent gorilla-like sagittal crest along the midline, which suggest strong chewing muscles—and broad, herbivorous teeth used for grinding. They are associated with bone tools and contested as the earliest evidence of fire usage.

Having become aware of them through press reports, the Bonn anatomist Hermann Schaaffhausen also examined the bones and came to the same conclusion as Fuhlrott had previously: they were an ancient form of modern humans. Fuhlrott and Schaaffhausen presented the find in June 1857 at the general meeting of the Natural History Association of the Prussian Rhineland.

Drawing on the high scientific authority of the British Museum, Woodward interpreted the Piltdown finds as a missing link between great apes and humans. Despite initial doubts, scientists at the Natural History Museum in London assigned the find an age of between 200,000 and 500,000 years.

In fact, much evidence suggests that Teotihuacán was an ancient city that influenced much of Central America centuries before the Aztec Empire and is one of the largest pre-Columbian sites in the Americas. The Mexican government therefore has more than just scientific reasons to research this place in more detail. Teotihuacán can be seen as a symbol of a long, uninterrupted culture in Mexico and thus as a forerunner of our nation. The reconstruction of the partially destroyed Sun Pyramid of Teotihuacán before the 100th anniversary of independence is intended to underline this symbolism and celebrate national unity and history." #NT!

 lepsius.7.f: "Giuseppe Fiorelli's excavations opened a new chapter in the study and excavation of Pompeii. During early excavations of the site, occasional voids in the ash layer had been found that contained human remains. Fiorelli realised these were spaces left by the decomposed bodies, and so devised the technique of injecting plaster into them to recreate the forms of Vesuvius's victims. This technique is still in use today, with a clear resin now used instead of plaster because it is more durable and does not destroy the bones, allowing further analysis. Fiorelli also introduced scientific documentation. He divided the city into today's nine areas and blocks and numbered the entrances of the individual houses.

The area of Teotihuacán had been permanently inhabited since the sixth century BC. Between 100 and 650 AD, the city was the dominant cultural, economic and military center of Mesoamerica. At the peak of its development it may have had up to 200,000 inhabitants. At its time, it was by far the largest city on the American continent and one of the largest in the world.

The Indus Civilization extended across almost all of what is now Pakistan as well as parts of India and Afghanistan. In 1912, J. Fleet found seals with unknown characters in what was then British India, which aroused the interest of the scientific public in Europe. Excavations were then carried out in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro in 1921/22 under the direction of John Marshall, the then director of the British Antiquities Service.
