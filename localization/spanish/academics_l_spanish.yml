 je_academics_academy: "Academic Careers" #NT!
 je_academics_academy_reason: "Depending on the scientific culture in our country, it takes longer or shorter for a researcher to leave the university and become available to us. Examples of academics are: engineers, astronomers, naturalists, paleontologists, and archaeologists. It is purely coincidental which academic is available at the end - unless we specialize at a university in a particular area. The scientist will then come from this area. The time it takes to graduate depends on factors such as the literacy rate, investments in academic operations, and the expansion of institutions. A selected focus also increases the speed. If an academic comes from a field that is already occupied by another, he replaces his predecessor. So it's important to be careful who you promote." #NT!
 je_academics_academy_goal: "It can take 3 to 30 years for an academic to become available." #NT!

 academics.51.t: "A new Scientist" #NT!
 academics.51.f: "Academics are scientists with special skills. For example, naturalists can collect additional specimens on research expeditions, go on safari and capture animals. Astronomers increase the number of astronomical objects found each year. Engineers double the speed of building large architectural projects. Archaeologists are essential for antiquity research. If a new academic emerges, he will replace his predecessor in this profession - this can be advantageous if the death or retirement of an academic is approaching, but should be carefully considered, especially with archaeologists - after all, they have special experience that can be lost." #NT!
