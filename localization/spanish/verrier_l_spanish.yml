Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies (determined by Kepler between 1609 and 1619), Galileo's pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Isaac Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation (that would come to bear his name)." #NT!

This work was further refined by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Pierre Simon Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations." #NT!

Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light obviously involved the existence of electric waves in free space, and his followers set themselves the task of experimentally demonstrating the truth of the theory. The discovery of electromagnetic waves in space led to the development of radio in the closing years of the 19th century." #NT!

J.A.R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements." #NT!
  
 je_verrier_neptune: "The Unknown Planet" #NT!
 je_verrier_neptune_reason: "In 1821, Alexis Bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus, making predictions of future positions based on Newton's laws of motion and gravitation. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesize some perturbing body. These irregularities, both in the planet's ecliptic longitude and in its radius vector (its distance from the Sun), could have been explained by several hypotheses: the effect of the Sun's gravity at such a great distance might differ from Newton's description; or the discrepancies might simply be observational error; or perhaps Uranus was being pulled, or perturbed, by an undiscovered planet. John Couch Adams learned of these irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the perturbation hypothesis. Adams believed that he could use the observed data on Uranus and Newton's law of gravitation to deduce the mass, position, and orbit of the perturbing body. Meanwhile, on 10 November 1845, Urbain Le Verrier presented to the Académie des sciences in Paris a memoir on Uranus and showed that the pre-existing theory failed to account for its motion. Unaware of Adams's work, he attempted a similar investigation, and on 1 June 1846, in a second memoir presented to a public meeting of the Académie, he gave the position, but not the mass or orbit, of the proposed perturbing body. Le Verrier located the unknown planet within one degree of its discovery position. Le Verrier was unaware that his public confirmation of Adams' private computations had set in motion a British search for the purported planet. On 31 August, Le Verrier presented a third memoir, now giving the mass and orbit of the new body. Now it was only a matter of finding the celestial body and thereby proving its existence." #NT!

 je_verrier_pluto_reason: "In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune. In 1906, Percival Lowell - a wealthy Bostonian who had founded Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894 - started an extensive project in search of a possible unknown planet, which he termed 'Planet X'. By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet. Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Planet X on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were. Percival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929. Vesto Melvin Slipher, the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old Clyde Tombaugh, who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings. Tombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates." #NT!

 je_verrier_charter_moon_reason: "Selenography is the study of the surface and physical features of the Moon (also known as geography of the Moon, or selenodesy). Like geography and areography, selenography is a subdiscipline within the field of planetary science. Historically, the principal concern of selenographists was the mapping and naming of the lunar terrane identifying maria, craters, mountain ranges, and other various features. Lunar mapping became systematic in 1779 when Johann Schröter began meticulous observation and measurement of lunar topography. In 1834 Johann Heinrich von Mädler published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published The Universal Selenography. All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when J.W. Draper, using a 5 inch reflector, produced a daguerreotype of the Moon and thus introduced photography to astronomy. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the telescope 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of astronomy." #NT!

 verrier_asteroid_congress_decision_desc: "Since the discovery of Ceres in 1801, astronomers have found more and more celestial bodies, which is why the number of planets in the solar system has continued to increase. The discovery of Neptune raised the question of whether a new category might make more sense for the numerous, smaller objects found particularly between Mars and Jupiter. In particular, the invention of new astronomical symbols and their relatively small size led astronomers to assume that they were more likely 'small stars' or 'small planets'. Of course, this categorization would mean that some of the objects previously considered planets would lose their status and would be degraded to mere boulders." #NT!

Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those, Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium.

In 1834 Johann Heinrich von Mädler published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published The Universal Selenography. All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when J.W. Draper, using a 5 inch reflector, produced a daguerreotype of the Moon and thus introduced photography to astronomy. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the telescope 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved.

In 1893, Grove Karl Gilbert suggested for the first time that the Moon's craters were formed by large asteroid impacts." #NT!
 verrier.53.t: "Lunar maria" #NT!
 verrier.53.f: "The lunar maria are large, dark, basaltic plains on Earth's Moon, formed by ancient asteroid impacts on the far side on the Moon that triggered volcanic activity on the opposite (near) side. They were dubbed maria, Latin for 'seas', by early astronomers who mistook them for actual seas. They are less reflective than the "highlands" as a result of their iron-rich composition, and hence appear dark to the naked eye. The maria cover about 16% of the lunar surface, mostly on the side visible from Earth. The few maria on the far side are much smaller, residing mostly in very large craters. The traditional nomenclature for the Moon also includes one oceanus (ocean), as well as features with the names lacus ('lake'), palus ('marsh'), and sinus ('bay'). The last three are smaller than maria, but have the same nature and characteristics." #NT!
 verrier.54.t: "Lunar highlands" #NT!

They have been dated to having formed 4.4 billion years ago, and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean. The concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after the Moon's formation." #NT!

It remained a naked-eye object until November for Southern Hemisphere observers. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful comets observed, and was one of the brightest of the century, making a strong impression both on artists and the general public. After a prior period of hysteria on the subject of comets, especially in Paris (caused partly by incorrect calculations by John Russell Hind which suggested that one would strike the Earth in June 1857) it went on to be the most-observed of the century due to its excellent visibility in dark skies for Northern Hemisphere viewers, particularly in Europe, and fine weather in September and October.

The object was hardly distinguishable in the small telescope attached to the sextant, and I found it necessary to employ a coloured glass between the index and horizon glasses, for the superior brilliance of the reference stars Procyon, Sirius, and Canopus, when they were brought into the field of view, quite extinguished its feeble light. Every comet hunter knows how necessary it is to the carrying out of his work to have at hand a copious catalogue of nebulae, but this valuable adjunct I unfortunately did not possess.

The first paper explained the photoelectric effect, the second paper explained Brownian motion. The third paper introduced Einstein's theory of special relativity, which established the universal constant speed of light for all reference frames and a theory of spacetime. The fourth, a consequence of the theory of special relativity, developed the principle of mass-energy equivalence, expressed in the famous equation E = mc^2 and which led to the discovery and use of atomic energy.

Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year.  In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life.  In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany.

General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. Einstein's theory has astrophysical implications, including the prediction of black holes - regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. Black holes are the end-state for massive stars. Microquasars and active galactic nuclei are believed to be stellar black holes and supermassive black holes.

Using the Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson, Hubble identified Cepheid variables, a standard candle discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. Comparing their apparent luminosity to their intrinsic luminosity gives their distance from Earth. Hubble found Cephieds in several nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum Nebula. His observations, made in 1924, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside our own, thus today they are no longer considered nebula.

It is the basis for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry he was awarded in 1908 'for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances'. Rutherford moved to the UK, where he and Thomas Royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. Later he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden.

It was published in two volumes between 1868 and 1870, and Mendeleev wrote it as he was preparing a textbook for his course. As he attempted to classify the elements according to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led him to postulate his periodic table; he claimed to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream: 'I saw in a dream a table where all elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper, only in one place did a correction later seem necessary.'

The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranus's orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton. Le Verrier sent the coordinates to Johann Gottfried Galle in Berlin, asking him to verify. Galle found Neptune in the same night he received Le Verrier's letter, within 1° of the predicted position. After that Le Verrier took on the task to '... embrace in a single work the entire planetary system, put everything in harmony if possible, otherwise, declare with certainty that there are as yet unknown causes of perturbations...', a work which would occupy him for the rest of his life. Le Verrier began by re-evaluating, to the 7th order, the technique of calculating the planetary perturbations known as the perturbing function. This derivation, which resulted in 469 mathematical terms, was complete by 1849. He next collected observations of the positions of the planets as far back as 1750. Examining these and correcting for inconsistencies with the most recent data occupied him until 1852. The tables formed the fundamental ephemeris of the Connaissance des Temps, the astronomical almanac of the Bureau des Longitudes, until about 1912." #NT!

 verrier.121.f: "Karl Ludwig Hencke - actually a former post secretary - devoted himself to his passion, astronomy, in his retirement. On December 8, 1845, he discovered the fifth asteroid in the solar system, Astraea. This was almost 40 years after the discovery of the last 'planet' Vesta. The King of Prussia awarded him an annual pension of 1,200 marks for the discovery. The discovery of Astraea should be the prelude to further discoveries in the asteroid belt and was the last major discovery of a celestial body before the discovery of Neptune. At the same time, 'Astraea' caused doubts to grow as to whether such small objects in space actually deserved the name 'planet'. At that time, Alexander von Humboldt suggested grouping the celestial bodies into their own category: the asteroid." #NT!

The Eidgenössische Sternwarte was built between 1862 and 1864 by Gottfried Semper who was the first professor of architecture at the Polytechnikum. He planned the main building of the Polytechnikum as well. The Sternwarte focused on the observation of sunspots and was the place where the observations to calculate the Zurich Sunspot Number was coordinated. The Zurich number, invented by the first director of the Sternwarte, Rudolf Wolf, is a way to measure the amount of sunspots and to estimate the activity of the sun. With the number it was actually possible to use data that was gathered since 1610 and calculate the historic sun activity.\n   After the Cantonal Hospital was built close to the Sternwarte in 1945 observing the night sky became limited. The observation was stopped in 1980. Today the former observatory houses the Collegium Helveticum of the Eidgenössisch Technische Hochschule. The Collegium is an interdisiplinary research institute.
