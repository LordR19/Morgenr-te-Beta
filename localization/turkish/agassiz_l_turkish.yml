 agassiz_geology_tech_desc: "In 1815, canal builder William Smith published his map of the geology of England and Wales, which took into account both fossil content and lithology. Smith recognized that certain rock sequences are also characterized by a very specific, unmistakable faunal sequence. In 1827, Leopold von Buch coined the term index fossil for fossils that allow relative dating. From now on, clarifying the question of the actual age of the Earth was a scientific matter." #NT!

 agassiz.201.t: "The Mid-Atlantic Ridge" #NT!
 agassiz.201.d: "Dr. [ROOT.Var('dubois_geologist_var').GetCharacter.GetLastName] has viewed some of the first data. The result of the expedition is astonishing: not only in the north of the Atlantic, but throughout the entire Atlantic Ocean, the submarine elevation can be seen as a continuous band that is only broken at the level of the equator. The geologist has named this phenomenon the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Further evaluation of the data will take place in the coming months and years." #NT!
 agassiz.201.f: "The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a mountain range in the Atlantic Ocean that lies mostly below sea level and extends for around 20,000 km. This makes it the longest of the mid-ocean ridges, a system that spans the Earth and is over 60,000 km long. Seafloor rise in the mid-Atlantic was first described by naval officer Matthew Fontaine Maury in 1853 and confirmed by the Challenger expedition in 1872. The reason was preliminary investigations into the laying of the first transatlantic deep-sea cables. During the German Meteor Expedition 1925-1927, a detailed profile of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was created using echo sounder measurements. The discovery of the Mid-Atlantic mountain range provided an early clue to the geodynamic processes of plate tectonics related to Wegener's theory of continental drift." #NT!

The symposium is considered a milestone in research into the history of the earth. Both have particularly highlighted the striking similarities in the geological and fossil composition of the coasts of South America and West Africa." #NT!
 agassiz.202.f: "How closely geology and paleontology are related is shown by numerous scientific personalities who stood out in both fields. The interaction between the earth layer and the fossil for chronological determination makes both inseparable sciences. George Cuvier is considered the father of paleontology, but also the godfather of geology. Even in the scientific disputes, for example in the Cuvier-Geoffroy debate of 1830, which centered on the dispute between gradualism and catastrophism, it was primarily geological and paleontological findings that were highlighted as agruments. Both modern geology and modern paleontology would not have been possible without synergies." #NT!

 agassiz.311.f: "The first meteorite collections were founded as early as the 18th century, before it was known that meteorites were of extraterrestrial origin. The oldest meteorite collection in the world is in the Natural History Museum in Vienna, where the foundation stone was laid with the Hraschina meteorite (fallen in 1751). Today it is home to the largest exhibition collection in the world with around 1,100 objects. Until the twentieth century, only a few hundred meteorite finds had ever been discovered. The reason there are now more than 30,000 meteorite finds in the world's collections started with the discovery by Harvey H. Nininger that meteorites are much more common on the surface of the Earth than was previously thought. Nininger's strategy was to search for meteorites in the Great Plains of the United States, where the land was largely cultivated and the soil contained few rocks." #NT!
