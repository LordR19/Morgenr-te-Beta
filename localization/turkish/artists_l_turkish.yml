 je_artists_impressionism_reason: "[concept_elgar_impressionism] is a style in art history that is characterized by the atmospheric depiction of fleeting snapshots of a scene. It emerged from a movement within painting in France in the second half of the 19th century. The term impressionism has also been applied to certain styles of music, literature, film and photography. While many Naturalists such as Heinrich Hart rejected music as a means of expressing a 'truth-seeking Actionism', the Impressionists often regarded the 'objectless dreaming ahead' to finely graduated colorful chords as a pleasure." #NT!

In Expressionism, the expressive level outweighs the aesthetic, appellative and factual level. The artist wants to represent his experience for the viewer. In contrast to musical impressionism, which depicts the perception of the external appearance of things, the expressionist art movements formulate the emotions of the human soul." #NT!

In addition to the expression Art nouveau, which is dominant in French, English and Italian, Modern Style is also used in English and Stile Floreale in Italian.

 artists.1002.f: "The Venice Biennale was established in 1895 and became increasingly international in the first decades of the 20th century. From 1907 on, several countries installed national pavilions at the exhibition, with the first being from Belgium. In 1910 the first internationally well-known artists were displayed: a room dedicated to Gustav Klimt, a one-man show for Renoir, a retrospective of Courbet. A work by Picasso 'Family of Saltimbanques' was removed from the Spanish salon in the central Palazzo because it was feared that its novelty might shock the public. By 1914 seven pavilions had been established: Belgium (1907), Hungary (1909), Germany (1909), Great Britain (1909), France (1912), and Russia (1914)." #NT!
