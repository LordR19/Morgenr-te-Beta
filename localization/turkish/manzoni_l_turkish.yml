 manzoni.1100.t: "\"Heidi\" by Johanna Spyri" #NT!
 manzoni.1100.d: "The Swiss author Johanna Spyri published a story about a young orphan girl living with her grandfather on the \"Alp\". After a rough start Heidi bonds with her grandfather and they enjoy living together. But soon they get seperated as Heidi has to move to Frankfurt am Main to live with Klara Streseman - daughter of a businessman. Will she ever see her grandfather again?" #NT!
 manzoni.1100.f: "The children listen eagerly to the maid reading from the new book. In their heads they become this girl in the mountains themselves, running around, playing, helping their grandfather. For a moment their fantasy lets them escape from the tightness of the city.\n\n#b Historically #! \"Heidi\" was published in 1880 and 1881. It was a story typically for its time showing the contrast of the idyllic mountains and the huge city of Frankfurt. In a time of upheavel the countryside was perceived as sort of a paradise by many. Soon after its publication Heidi was translated to other languages and became one of the most well known Swiss books.\n\n#b Today #! Heidi is still very popular. The book was translated to 50 languages and sold 50 million times. There are multiple movies, tv shows, comics and musicals. Heidi is especially popular in Japan causing many Japanese tourists to travel to Switzerland." #NT!

 manzoni.1101.t: "\"Kleider machen Leute\" by Gottfried Keller" #NT!
 manzoni.1101.d: "Gottfried Keller is not an unknown writer. He published works like \"Der Grüne Heinrich\" and \"Die Leute von Seldwyla\". His newest story \"Kleider machen Leute\" is one story in the second part of \"Die Leute von Seldwyla\". A journeyman tailor who wasn't paid by his employer gets picked up by carriage on his way. When he arrives in the village of Goldach the people assume that he is a noble man because he arrived in a carriage, wears luxurious clothes and has groomed mustache. As he is quite shy he does not clear up the misunderstanding. Will the people find out about his secret?" #NT!
 manzoni.1101.f: "Such an exciting story. Will the journeyman tailor that accidentally pretended to be a polish count be exposed? Or will everything go well for him?\n\n#b Historically #! \"Kleider machen Leute\" was published in 1874. Its title is a German saying which translates to \"clothes make people\" which could be seen as a synopsis of the whole story. Keller was a writer in the literary tradition of the \"Bürgerlicher Realismus\" which often depicted the social circumstances in which people lived. Another aspect of this literary tradition was to show society a mirror. In \"Kleider machen Leute\" the people easily get convinced by looks. It does not matter who you are but more who you pretend to be. Maybe by reading the story some people challenged their own views?\n\nAs many other books of the time, \"Kleider machen Leute\" has become a classic of German literature. Especially students have to read the story in German classes. The topic of \"Kleider machen Leute\" probably is as relevant today as it was in the 19th Century." #NT!

 manzoni.1102.t: "\"Uli der Knecht\" by Jeremias Gotthelf" #NT!
 manzoni.1102.d: "Under his pseudonym \"Jeremias Gotthelf\" Albert Bitzius, a Swiss pastor, published his book \"Uli der Knecht\". It is a typical work for Gotthelf as it features the farmhand Uli (Ulric) who has to overcome his sloppiness to find fulfilment. To achieve this he needs multiple role models and has to obey to different authority figures." #NT!
 manzoni.1102.f: "\"I am not thinking of you only but Ulric also. If he is not reproved, he will go from bad to worse. We must make it a matter of conscience, for whatever people may say about the new fashion, masters are still masters.\"\n\n#b Historically, #! \"Uli der Knecht\" was published in 1841. It is a typical story for Gotthelf as it is a \"Bildungsroman\". \"Bildungsroman\" is a literary genre in which the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist is the main aspect. \"Uli der Knecht\" shows this perfectly as Uli changes from a neglectful drunkard to a dutiful and frugal farmhand. During the time of its conception Switzerland was in a political struggle between conservatives and liberals that. The novel takes the view of the conservative side that was based in the countryside.\n\n\"Uli der Knecht\" is probably the most influential \"Bildungsroman\" of the 19th Century. To this day it is a classic of German literature. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is its heavy use of local dialect from the Canton of Bern. It includes word that are still in use to this day as well as word that are not used anymore for example \"Gunteräri\" a Bernese word for opposite." #NT!

 manzoni.1103.t: "\"Der Steppenwolf\" by Hermann Hesse" #NT!
 manzoni.1103.d: "Hermann Hesse published his newest book \"Der Steppenwolf\" that he wrote during his time in Basel. Hesse is already known for his other works like \"Siddharta\". In his newest story middle aged Harry Haller is unhappy with the burgeois society. He even considers to commit suicide but meeting the young Hermine and her colleagues changes his life. Hermine wouldn't be considered the best influence, as she prostitutes herself sometimes, but she can help Harry to experience things he didn't know before, releasing the \"Steppenwolf\" inside of him." #NT!
 manzoni.1103.f: "\"I wish I could just escape the burgeois world like Harry Haller...\" how many minds of the time had those thoughts while reading \"Steppenwolf\"? How many were not happy with the way of life in such a rational and boring world?\n\n#b Historically, #! \"Der Steppenwolf\" was published in 1927. Hesse - born in Germany but by that time a Swiss citizen - himself struggled with a depression during the time he wrote the book. In \"Steppenwolf\" Harry is in a similar situation as Hesse, he lives in a new town and hates the burgeois society. Like many other works of the time, Steppenwolf showed the inner struggle of a man with the rational and technological time he lived in.\n\nHermann Hesse is one of the most influential Swiss authors and one of only two Swiss writers to get awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. His works are often read in German Literature classes but even apart from that his stories are still relevant to this day." #NT!

 manzoni.1104.d: "Rodolphe Töpffer published his newest bande desinée \"Histoire de monsieur Crépin\". It is not a traditional book but contains panels of pictures and short texts underneath. The story is a caricature of education in our country and shows absurd systems of teaching. Every new teacher shows of his form of education, progressively getting more absurd. The last teacher's teaching depends of the number of bulges on the head of each child." #NT!
 manzoni.1104.f: "I have never seen so many pictures in one story! And they are drawn in the form of caricatures. What an interesting new way to tell stories!\n\n#b Historically, #! \"Histoire de monsieur Crépin\" was not the first bande desinée of Töpffer. His specific style that is an early form of comics was even praised by Goethe. After many of Töpffer's friends urged him to publish this new form of writing, Töpffer released his first bande desinée in 1827. Töpffer was one of the first to connect the technique of using panels with the art style of caricature. He also experimented with different sized pictures to create a feeling of time.\n\nTöpffer is not the most well known Swiss writer but his works were an important stepping stone for the creation of modern comics. Today a monument in Geneva commemorates his live and work." #NT!

Then she finds the love of her life. The mother is not happy about it and forbids them from meeting. But that doesn't keep Aline from rendez-vous with him. For the man, Julien, son of the mayor, she is just one of many girls. Will they live happily ever after or will their love story end tragically?" #NT!

Later he became the most influential Swiss author of his generation and published many more books. His \"Histoire du soldat\" tells the story of a soldier trading his violin for a book that tells the future and was set to music by Igor Strawinsky in 1918.\n\nRamuz is probably the most important Swiss writer from the French speaking part of Switzerland.

 manzoni.1200.t: "\"I promessi sposi\" by Alessandro Manzoni" #NT!
 manzoni.1200.d: "\"I promessi sposi\" (The Bethrothed) is an Italian historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni, first published in 1827, in three volumes. It was the first Italian historical novel, a model for subsequent Italian literary fiction and a basis for the modern Italian language. In the early 19th century, there was still some controversy as to what form the standard literary language of Italy should take. Manzoni - originally from Milan - was firmly in favor of the dialect of Florence and, after 'washing his vocabulary on the banks of the Arno' (as he put it), he revised the novel's language for its republication in 1842." #NT!
 manzoni.1200.f: "Set in northern Italy in 1628, the novel is about two young people, Renzo and Lucia, who live in a village on Lake Como and want to get married, but are prevented and persecuted by the local feudal lord, who has his eye on Lucia, which is why they have to flee their village. Many expressions, Quotes and names from the novel are still commonly used in Italian, such as Perpetua (meaning a priest's house worker) or 'Questo matrimonio non s'ha da fare' ('This marriage is not to be performed', used ironically) and it is still considered a true masterpiece of world literature. Because the book takes place during the period of Spanish occupation, \"I promessi sposi\" has often been interpreted as a hidden attack against Austrian rule in 19th century Italy." #NT!
 manzoni.1200.g: "Who cares about a silly Italian novel?" #NT!
 manzoni.1200.h: "The peak of Italian culture!" #NT!
 manzoni.1202.t: "\"La Ginestra\" by Giacomo Leopardi" #NT!
 manzoni.1202.d: "Giacomo Leopardi created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the Romantic era. Together with Alessandro Manzoni, Leopardi had an immense influence on the Italian language and was one figurehead of patriotic movements in Italy, even if he had reservations about nationalism and belief in progress. He often wrote about poetry in general and about his own idea of poetry, of its language and scope. Leopardi would die in 1837, aged just 38." #NT!
 manzoni.1202.f: "\"La Ginestra\" (The Broom) is the penultimate lyric poem by Giacomo Leopardi. It opens with the description of the slopes of Vesuvius, the volcano that in 79 AD. it erupted, sowing destruction and death where once stood villas, gardens and large, prosperous cities. From this moment on, the poet turns to the broom, which becomes the privileged interlocutor of his poetic discourse: abandoning himself to the memory, Leopardi tells the flower that he has already seen it in the deserted countryside. The broom is therefore considered a symbol of beauty and resistance in the face of devastation. But even the broom will have to bow to the inevitable at some point, with which the poem emphasizes the transience of human existence in contrast to the forces of nature. In doing so, Leopardi mocks the idea of humans dominating nature or placing material wealth and power above higher ideals." #NT!
 manzoni.1202.g: "How melancholic." #NT!
 manzoni.1203.t: "\"Rime Nuove\" by Giosuè Carducci" #NT!
 manzoni.1203.d: "Giosuè Carducci was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy, being a part of the general cultural and political life. Carducci was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. His collections \"Rime Nuove\" (New Rhymes) and Odi Barbare (Barbarian Odes) contain his greatest works. He also translated some works of Goethe and Heine into Italian. One year before his death, Carducci became the first Italian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature." #NT!
 manzoni.1203.f: "In the collection \"Rime Nuove\", which is preceded by an Intermezzo, the echoes and motifs of Hugo, von Platen, Goethe, Heine, Baudelaire and Poe are captured. In it the contents and forms derive largely from previous writings but are more in-depth and mature. Among the themes that emerge in the \"Rime Nuove\", an important place is taken by the cult of the past and historical memories where the dream of the creation of an egalitarian and liberal society is felt above all through the exaltation of the age of the municipalities which are taken as an example of moral health and civil life. Another example taken by Carducci of democratic expansion is the French Revolution which is recalled in the twelve sonnets of the 'Ça ira'." #NT!
 manzoni.1203.g: "But can you trust a man who writes a satanic hymn?" #NT!
 manzoni.1204.t: "\"Myricae\" by Giovanni Pascoli" #NT!
 manzoni.1204.d: "Giovanni Pascoli studied at the University of Bologna, where his teacher and mentor was Giosuè Carducci. Pascoli, even in a period of positivism and science, believed that life is a mystery. Only symbolic associations discovered in the humble things of nature can lead one to catch a glimpse of the truth behind mere appearances. His later poems share similar themes but are more experimental, and reflect his knowledge of classical antiquity. They were a great influence on later Italian poets, who incorporated his melancholy themes into their own works. Pascoli wrote in both Italian and Latin." #NT!
 manzoni.1204.f: "Myricae is a collection of poems by Giovanni Pascoli. The title of Pascoli's collection derives from a part of the second verse of Virgil's IV Bucolica. Myricae extends for almost the entire span of the author's poetic production, so that the compositional history can be said to coincide with the very development of Pascoli's poetic consciousness. Myricae's poetry presents a symbolic vision of the world with intuition and revelation of the analogies and arcane correspondences between things, a sense of life full of perplexity and bewilderment. The sense of the mystery of life, anguish, death and melancholy are widespread aspects in Pascoli's poetry which also presents the theme of the nest as a metaphor for the home." #NT!
 manzoni.1204.g: "A little great poet." #NT!
 manzoni.1205.t: "\"La Coscienza di Zeno\" by Italo Svevo" #NT!
 manzoni.1205.d: "Aron Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo, was an Italian writer and businessman, author of novels, plays, and short stories. A close friend of Irish novelist and poet James Joyce, Svevo was considered a pioneer of the psychological novel in Italy and is best known for his modernist novel\"La Coscienza di Zeno\" (Zeno's Conscience), which became a widely appreciated classic of Italian literature. Svevo was also a model for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Joyce's Ulysses." #NT!
 manzoni.1205.f: "The work, showing the author's interest in the theories of Sigmund Freud, is written in the form of the memoirs of Zeno Cosini, who writes them at the insistence of his psychoanalyst. The novel is in fact the analysis of the psyche of Zeno, an individual who feels ill and inept and is continually seeking recovery from his malaise through multiple attempts, sometimes absurd or counterproductive. Schmitz's novel received almost no attention from Italian readers and critics at the time. The work might have disappeared altogether if it were not for the efforts of James Joyce. Joyce helped Svevo to have it translated into French and then published \"La Coscienza di Zeno\" in Paris, where critics praised it extravagantly. That led Italian critics to discover it." #NT!
 manzoni.1205.g: "Is the author making fun of Sigmund Freud?" #NT!
 manzoni.1206.t: "\"Il Piacere\" by Gabriele D'Annunzio" #NT!
 manzoni.1206.d: "Gabriele D'Annunzio had a prominent place in Italian literature and political life. He was nicknamed Il Vate (The Poet) and Il Profeta (The Prophet). D'Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French Symbolism and British Aestheticism. At the height of his success, D'Annunzio was celebrated for the originality, power and decadence of his writing. His work had immense impact across Europe and on generations of Italian writers." #NT!
 manzoni.1206.f: "\"Il Piacere\" was the first novel by D'Annunzio. Just as a century earlier the book 'Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis' by Ugo Foscolo had spread the romantic current and sensitivity in Italy, \"Il Piacere\" and its protagonist Andrea Sperelli introduced the decadent tendency and aestheticism into Italian culture at the end of the nineteenth century. D'Annunzio inaugurates a new type of psychological and introspective prose, destined to have great success and which allowed him to investigate the errors and adversities of the life of the 'last descendant of an intellectual race'." #NT!
 manzoni.1206.g: "Is this symbolism or already decadence?" #NT!
 manzoni.1207.t: "\"Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi" #NT!
 manzoni.1207.d: "Carlo Lorenzini, better known as Carlo Collodi, was a journalist and author who is best remembered for his story about the puppet Pinocchio who came to life. He worked full-time as a satirist and humorist in several Italian newspapers. He later worked as a theater reviewer and editor, as well as a translator of French fairy tales." #NT!
 manzoni.1207.f: "\"Le avventure di Pinocchio. Storia di un burattino\" (The Adventures of Pinocchio. Story of a Puppet) first appeared in the 'Giornale dei Bambini' from 1880 as a serial story before being published in two volumes in 1883. It is about the mischievous adventures of an animated marionette named Pinocchio and his creator and father figure, a poor woodcarver named Geppetto. A universal icon and a metaphor of the human condition, the book is considered a canonical piece of children's literature and has had great impact on world culture. Philosopher Benedetto Croce considered it one of the greatest works of Italian literature." #NT!
 manzoni.1207.g: "This children's tale would definitely have been more successful as a movie." #NT!
 manzoni.1208.t: "\"Cuore\" by Edoardo De Amicis" #NT!
 manzoni.1208.d: "Edoardo de Amicis was an Italian writer and journalist who later became known for his children's literature. De Amicis was a patriot and fought in the Italian Wars of Independence, but resigned from his service because he was disillusioned with the army. As an avowed Freemason, De Amicis made an effort in his works to replace the Catholicism deep in the Italian soul with secular virtues and commitment to the state. In later years, socialist ideas had a formative influence on him." #NT!
 manzoni.1208.f: "'This book is particularly dedicated to elementary school children, who are between 9 and 13 years old, and it could be titled: Story of a school year, written by a third grader from a municipal school in Italy. By saying written by a third grader, I don't mean that he actually wrote it, as it is printed. He gradually noted in a notebook, as he knew, what he had seen, heard, thought, in school and outside; and his father, at the end of the year, wrote these pages on those notes, taking care not to alter his thoughts, and to preserve, as much as possible, his son's words. Who then, 4 years later, already being in high school, reread the manuscript and added something of his own, making use of his still fresh memory of the people and things. Now read this book, boys: I hope you will be happy with it and that it will do you some good.' -Edoardo De Amicis" #NT!

 manzoni.1300.f: "In 1843, the german poet Heinrich Heine, who left Germany 1831 for France, went back for a few weeks, visiting his mother and publisher Julius Campe in Hamburg. Heine was not a typical romantic author, but more a satirical one who criticized the reactionary policy and censorship of the authoritarian german states, but also his nationalistic and chauvinistic compatriots. On the return journey to Paris, the first draft of \"Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen\" (Germany: A Winter's Tale) took shape. According to the censorship regulations of the Carlsbad Conference of 1819, manuscripts of more than twenty folios did not fall under the scrutiny of the censor. Therefore it was published together with other poems in a volume called 'New Poems'. The work showed Heines world of images and his folk-song-like poetic diction in a compact gathering, with ironic criticisms of the circumstances in his homeland." #NT!

The Bourbons in Parma had been granted the Kingdom of Etruria after Bonaparte had incorporated Parma into the French Empire; However, Etruria had to give way to the restoration of Tuscany under a Habsburg heir. The compromise was therefore that the princes of the House of Bourbon-Parma could claim the Duchy of Lucca for themselves, while Maria Luisa could keep Parma as an appanage until her death.

This included the question of the reinstatement of the Bourbons in Parma and the appanage for Napoleon's wife Maria Luisa, a Habsburg native. The Bourbons in Parma had been granted the Kingdom of Etruria after Bonaparte had incorporated Parma into the French Empire; However, Etruria had to give way to the restoration of Tuscany under a Habsburg heir. The compromise was therefore that the princes of the House of Bourbon-Parma could claim the Duchy of Lucca for themselves, while Maria Luisa could keep Parma as an appanage until her death. After Maria Luisa's death, the House of Bourbon-Parma was supposed to return to Parma and Lucca fell to Tuscany." #NT!

This feeling will spread from region to region, no matter how the state sets the right framework: regions that are well served by government administrations, universities, barracks or naval bases are more likely to develop an all-Italian identity due to their integrative function. Heavily urbanized areas are more likely to find access to a concept that was previously only researched by intellectuals. Under perfect circumstances, one sub-state could adopt the new identity every year. If all Italians in the nation state feel like they are, this will also have an influence on the Italians abroad, who will then increasingly feel like our countrymen abroad rather than as Lombards, Sicilians or Tuscans." #NT!

After the conquest of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies in 1861 by the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia (later Kingdom of Italy), the most famous and well known form of brigandage in the area emerged. Amongst the brigands were a mixture of people, with different working backgrounds and motives; the brigands included former prisoners, bandits and other people who the Italian government regarded as common criminals, but also former soldiers and loyalists of the Bourbon army. They launched attacks not only against the Italian authorities and the land owning upper-classes, but also against common people, frequently looting villages, towns and farms, and committing armed robberies against both individuals and groups, including farmers, townspeople and rival brigand bands." #NT!

It wasn't just Tuscan that had great prestige because of Dante Alighieri. Venetian was the official and written language of the Republic of Venice, plays such as those by Carlo Goldoni and literature were written in Venetian, which also still had a special significance as a lingua franca in the Adriatic region. Something similar can be said about Neapolitan. In the 19th century, however, the view prevailed that there was only one standard Italian variety and that all other languages in Italy were mere dialects - even though the Italian spoken in the north already had a special linguistic status. However, in the course of political movements, the reality became more and more prevalent: a language differs from a dialect in that the former has a navy and an army." #NT!

The idea of creating a tomb of artists, scientists and other great personalities based on the model of the Parthenon, similar to that in France, arose early on. Santa Croce in Florence, which had previously served as the burial place of prominent citizens, seemed the right place for this. Personalities such as Machiavelli, Michelangelo and Galileo have long been more Italian than Tuscan. Ugo Foscolo, a poet of Venetian origin from the island of Zakynthos, lived in the revolutionary years and is considered a defining figure of early Italian liberalism and nationalism.
