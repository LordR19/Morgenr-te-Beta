 manzoni.1200.t: "\"I promessi sposi\" by Alessandro Manzoni" #NT!
 manzoni.1200.d: "\"I promessi sposi\" (The Bethrothed) is an Italian historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni, first published in 1827, in three volumes. It was the first Italian historical novel, a model for subsequent Italian literary fiction and a basis for the modern Italian language. In the early 19th century, there was still some controversy as to what form the standard literary language of Italy should take. Manzoni - originally from Milan - was firmly in favor of the dialect of Florence and, after 'washing his vocabulary on the banks of the Arno' (as he put it), he revised the novel's language for its republication in 1842." #NT!
 manzoni.1200.f: "Set in northern Italy in 1628, the novel is about two young people, Renzo and Lucia, who live in a village on Lake Como and want to get married, but are prevented and persecuted by the local feudal lord, who has his eye on Lucia, which is why they have to flee their village. Many expressions, Quotes and names from the novel are still commonly used in Italian, such as Perpetua (meaning a priest's house worker) or 'Questo matrimonio non s'ha da fare' ('This marriage is not to be performed', used ironically) and it is still considered a true masterpiece of world literature. Because the book takes place during the period of Spanish occupation, \"I promessi sposi\" has often been interpreted as a hidden attack against Austrian rule in 19th century Italy." #NT!

 manzoni.1202.t: "\"La Ginestra\" by Giacomo Leopardi" #NT!
 manzoni.1202.d: "Giacomo Leopardi created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the Romantic era. Together with Alessandro Manzoni, Leopardi had an immense influence on the Italian language and was one figurehead of patriotic movements in Italy, even if he had reservations about nationalism and belief in progress. He often wrote about poetry in general and about his own idea of poetry, of its language and scope. Leopardi would die in 1837, aged just 38." #NT!
 manzoni.1202.f: "\"La Ginestra\" (The Broom) is the penultimate lyric poem by Giacomo Leopardi. It opens with the description of the slopes of Vesuvius, the volcano that in 79 AD. it erupted, sowing destruction and death where once stood villas, gardens and large, prosperous cities. From this moment on, the poet turns to the broom, which becomes the privileged interlocutor of his poetic discourse: abandoning himself to the memory, Leopardi tells the flower that he has already seen it in the deserted countryside. The broom is therefore considered a symbol of beauty and resistance in the face of devastation. But even the broom will have to bow to the inevitable at some point, with which the poem emphasizes the transience of human existence in contrast to the forces of nature. In doing so, Leopardi mocks the idea of humans dominating nature or placing material wealth and power above higher ideals." #NT!
 manzoni.1202.g: "How melancholic." #NT!
 manzoni.1203.t: "\"Rime Nuove\" by Giosuè Carducci" #NT!
 manzoni.1203.d: "Giosuè Carducci was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy, being a part of the general cultural and political life. Carducci was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. His collections \"Rime Nuove\" (New Rhymes) and Odi Barbare (Barbarian Odes) contain his greatest works. He also translated some works of Goethe and Heine into Italian. One year before his death, Carducci became the first Italian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature." #NT!
 manzoni.1203.f: "In the collection \"Rime Nuove\", which is preceded by an Intermezzo, the echoes and motifs of Hugo, von Platen, Goethe, Heine, Baudelaire and Poe are captured. In it the contents and forms derive largely from previous writings but are more in-depth and mature. Among the themes that emerge in the \"Rime Nuove\", an important place is taken by the cult of the past and historical memories where the dream of the creation of an egalitarian and liberal society is felt above all through the exaltation of the age of the municipalities which are taken as an example of moral health and civil life. Another example taken by Carducci of democratic expansion is the French Revolution which is recalled in the twelve sonnets of the 'Ça ira'." #NT!
 manzoni.1203.g: "But can you trust a man who writes a satanic hymn?" #NT!
 manzoni.1204.t: "\"Myricae\" by Giovanni Pascoli" #NT!
 manzoni.1204.d: "Giovanni Pascoli studied at the University of Bologna, where his teacher and mentor was Giosuè Carducci. Pascoli, even in a period of positivism and science, believed that life is a mystery. Only symbolic associations discovered in the humble things of nature can lead one to catch a glimpse of the truth behind mere appearances. His later poems share similar themes but are more experimental, and reflect his knowledge of classical antiquity. They were a great influence on later Italian poets, who incorporated his melancholy themes into their own works. Pascoli wrote in both Italian and Latin." #NT!
 manzoni.1204.f: "Myricae is a collection of poems by Giovanni Pascoli. The title of Pascoli's collection derives from a part of the second verse of Virgil's IV Bucolica. Myricae extends for almost the entire span of the author's poetic production, so that the compositional history can be said to coincide with the very development of Pascoli's poetic consciousness. Myricae's poetry presents a symbolic vision of the world with intuition and revelation of the analogies and arcane correspondences between things, a sense of life full of perplexity and bewilderment. The sense of the mystery of life, anguish, death and melancholy are widespread aspects in Pascoli's poetry which also presents the theme of the nest as a metaphor for the home." #NT!

 manzoni.1206.t: "\"Il Piacere\" by Gabriele D'Annunzio" #NT!
 manzoni.1206.d: "Gabriele D'Annunzio had a prominent place in Italian literature and political life. He was nicknamed Il Vate (The Poet) and Il Profeta (The Prophet). D'Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French Symbolism and British Aestheticism. At the height of his success, D'Annunzio was celebrated for the originality, power and decadence of his writing. His work had immense impact across Europe and on generations of Italian writers." #NT!
 manzoni.1206.f: "\"Il Piacere\" was the first novel by D'Annunzio. Just as a century earlier the book 'Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis' by Ugo Foscolo had spread the romantic current and sensitivity in Italy, \"Il Piacere\" and its protagonist Andrea Sperelli introduced the decadent tendency and aestheticism into Italian culture at the end of the nineteenth century. D'Annunzio inaugurates a new type of psychological and introspective prose, destined to have great success and which allowed him to investigate the errors and adversities of the life of the 'last descendant of an intellectual race'." #NT!

 manzoni.1300.d: "Heinrich Heine, one of the most important poets in the German language, wrote a satirical epic poem directed against the political situation in Germany. While liberals celebrate the book, some politicians want to ban it." #NT!
 manzoni.1300.f: "In 1843, the german poet Heinrich Heine, who left Germany 1831 for France, went back for a few weeks, visiting his mother and publisher Julius Campe in Hamburg. Heine was not a typical romantic author, but more a satirical one who criticized the reactionary policy and censorship of the authoritarian german states, but also his nationalistic and chauvinistic compatriots. On the return journey to Paris, the first draft of \"Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen\" (Germany: A Winter's Tale) took shape. According to the censorship regulations of the Carlsbad Conference of 1819, manuscripts of more than twenty folios did not fall under the scrutiny of the censor. Therefore it was published together with other poems in a volume called 'New Poems'. The work showed Heines world of images and his folk-song-like poetic diction in a compact gathering, with ironic criticisms of the circumstances in his homeland." #NT!

Eichendorff's guiding poetic theme was that Man should find happiness in full absorption of the beauties and changing moods of Nature. The lyricism of Eichendorff's poetry is much praised, and his poems have been set by many composers, including Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hans Pfitzner, and Alexander Zemlinsky. In 1837, his poem \"Mondnacht\" (Night of the Moon) was published, which is often seen as the 'pearl of pearls' of german romantic lyricism." #NT!

The weavers are therefore not classical factory workers, but impoverished, self-employed people who are factory-dependent. Facing the suffering of exploitation and the danger that they could be exploited even further in the future, some in the region have banded together and are now threatening the entrepreneur whom they hold responsible for their misery.

Unlike most plays of any period, as pointed out many times in literature criticism and introductions, the play has no true central character, providing ample opportunities for ensemble acting.

However, in the course of political movements, the reality became more and more prevalent: a language differs from a dialect in that the former has a navy and an army." #NT!

 manzoni.918.t: "The Fate of Foscolo" #NT!
 manzoni.918.d: "As national sentiment becomes more and more evident, voices are being raised calling for the body of the great Italian poet Ugo Foscolo to be transported from Great Britain to Italy." #NT!
 manzoni.918.f: "The new Italian nation was looking for landmarks: historical events but also historical personalities. The idea of creating a tomb of artists, scientists and other great personalities based on the model of the Parthenon, similar to that in France, arose early on. Santa Croce in Florence, which had previously served as the burial place of prominent citizens, seemed the right place for this. Personalities such as Machiavelli, Michelangelo and Galileo have long been more Italian than Tuscan. Ugo Foscolo, a poet of Venetian origin from the island of Zakynthos, lived in the revolutionary years and is considered a defining figure of early Italian liberalism and nationalism. He would be the perfect addition to this gallery of great Italian minds. However, Foscolo died in exile in 1827 - in Turnham Green near London." #NT!

 manzoni.920.f_foscolo: "Ugo Foscolo's return to Italy is considered one of the first key points for the young nation-state. Foscolo was celebrated like a returned hero; his burial was like a procession - with people crying and cheering. With the 'Pantheon' of great Italian personalities in Santa Croce, a fixed point of Italian nationalism was inaugurated that people could orientate themselves towards. The Italian heroes should would be the focus of this ideology, rather than the Catholic saints." #NT!

The worship of Dante has become a true cult among patriots and is at the same time seen as evidence to the outside world that a pan-Italian feeling existed long before the Risorgimento - after all, it was Dante who first defined the borders of Italy as the area in which the language of the 'Sì' would be spoken. A monument is to be erected in Florence that commemorates the 'supreme poet'." #NT!

The renegade peoples of the Alps with their crude Latin, and the Corsicans under the yoke of the French with their Tuscan tongue must also become part of the nation - not only politically but also spiritually.

Of these, those who spoke Oc occupy the western part of southern Europe, beginning from the borders of the Genoese. But those who say Si assume the eastern one of the above-mentioned boundaries, namely as far as that promontory of Italy where the bosom of the Adriatic Sea begins, and as far as Sicily.' -Dante Alighieri" #NT!

 manzoni.3.f_juvenile: "In the 17th and 18th centuries, Puritans in England and America published children's books steeped in Protestant ethics. Some of the first children's books that had a purely educational message as well as entertainment value were published by John Newbery in the 1740s. A few years earlier, Thomas Boreman had written the Gigantick Histories. Nevertheless, moralistic values continued to shape many children's books until the late 19th century, although from the middle of the 18th century the purely religious message was increasingly replaced by the rational moralism propagated by Locke and Rousseau. From the middle of the 19th century, pure fantasy and adventure stories became more and more accepted as children's literature." #NT!
 manzoni.3.f_crime: "Even though the origins of the crime novel go back further, it only became established as a literary genre in the 19th century. It usually focuses on a crime and its prosecution and investigation by the police, a detective or a private individual. The possibilities of describing psychological moments that drive the criminal, providing descriptions of the environment or plunging the investigator into his own troubles of conscience were also processed in a sophisticated literary manner. Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment can be understood as a crime novel. The transition to thriller and mystery can be fluid." #NT!
 manzoni.3.f_adventure: "Adventure literature is as old as literature itself. Adventure literature can be traced back to antiquity, even to the Ancient Near East. The medieval Arthurian novel and chivalric novel are considered further forerunners of modern adventure novels. A variety of adventurous literature appeared from the 19th century onwards, the best-known representatives of which were Alexandre Dumas, Robert Louis Stevenson, Karl May and Jules Verne. " #NT!
 manzoni.3.f_science: "Even before the term science fiction was developed, visions of future technical developments can be found since the Middle Ages at the latest. The term itself was first used in 1851 by the British poet and essayist William Wilson. Parallel to the belief in science, fear of science and technology emerged in the 19th century. This belief and this fear merged into the epochally new and divided attitude to life of being a neo-mythical titan who is afraid of his own power. This is why dystopias emerged, such as those of Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. This ambivalence characterizes science fiction." #NT!
 manzoni.3.f_social: "The origins of modern social criticism go back at least to the Enlightenment period. Fictional literature can have a significant social impact. For example, the 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe furthered the anti-slavery movement in the United States. George Orwell and Charles Dickens wrote Animal Farm and A Tale of Two Cities, respectively, to express their disillusionment with society and human nature." #NT!
 manzoni.3.f_literary: "Literary fiction is often used as a synonym for literature, in the exclusive sense of writings specifically considered to have considerable artistic merit. Literary fiction includes classic books: that is works in any discipline that have been accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy. While literary fiction is commonly regarded as artistically superior to genre fiction, the two are not mutually exclusive." #NT!
 manzoni.3.f_devotional: "Devotional Literature originally describes popular writings with a religious motivation. It is not theological literature because it does not pursue scientific discourses and has no dogmatic intentions. Rather, with the changes of modern times there was a concentration on inwardness, which was characterized by increased piety. It was a guide to virtuous living that was intended to emotionally uplift the spirit." #NT!
 manzoni.3.f_romance: "The popular romance novel refers to an extensive genre of trivial literature that is aimed primarily at the female readership and whose structure mostly follows trivial, i.e. easily accessible, basic patterns. However, not every romance novel can be classified as trivial literature, as topics such as child deaths, abuse, fatal illnesses or similarly complex topics cannot be easily trivialized." #NT!

 manzoni.301.f: "The term bibliomania refers to an excessive passion for collecting books that exhibits hallmarks of addiction and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder. In contrast to harmless bibliophilia, which often accompanies the accumulation of a private library, bibliomania involves either the aspect of compulsive hoarding, the financial ruin caused by collecting, or the commission of crimes to satisfy bibliomania. The first known case of a criminal bibliomaniac in Germany was the Saxon priest Johann Georg Tinius. He embezzled church funds and committed several attempted robbery-murders (in which he used narcotics) to finance his passion for collecting. The auction catalog of Tinius' remaining library alone contained 16,650 works. An example of a bibliotaph is the Comte de Lignerolles, who supposedly withdrew completely from social life from 1848 and devoted himself only to expanding and maintaining his book collection, which he kept in one in a specially designed apartment in Paris. He did not share his knowledge with others and even denied owning certain books. The size and value of his collection only became apparent when the books were auctioned after his death." #NT!

Throughout the 1800s, women's reading circles expanded, with some becoming outspoken on social issues such as abolition—foreshadowing the club movement of the end of that century.
