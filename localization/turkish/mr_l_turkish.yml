 je_mr_visit_building_reason: "A visit to one of the important buildings in our country can help to deepen knowledge about a specialist area. Artefacts found can be admired and exhibitions organized in archaeological museums. Observatories provide information about the status of international and national astronomical research. The opera lists the major composers currently alive, as well as a detailed listing of our annually generated musical tradition. In the zoo, the animals caught so far can be visited and further information can be obtained. The fossil collection shows an overview of fossils and dinosaur bones found so far, and dinosaur skeletons can also be assembled here." #NT!
