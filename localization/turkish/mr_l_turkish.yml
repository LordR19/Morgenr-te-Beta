 objective_thriving_culture_desc: "Any barbaric country can conquer a patch of earth. But higher civilization shows itself in the realm of science and culture. Uncover archeological treasures, discover new stars and planets, hire composers, collect exotic animals and plants, embark on research trips or set records in the aviation age. A new morning dawns!" #NT!
  
 objective_thriving_culture_name_AUS: "Austria" #NT!
 objective_thriving_culture_desc_AUS: "Bella gerant alii, tu felix Austria nube! Are these times over for Austria? The Congress of Vienna and Metternich pushed Austria one last time into the central position of Europe, but the ambitions of Prussia and Russia threaten the compromise-oriented policy of the Habsburg Empire. As in the past, can Austria triumph in the future by becoming a center of attraction for culture and lifestyle? Defend Vienna's reputation as a music metropolis and develop it into the most attractive city in Europe." #NT!
 objective_thriving_culture_name_BEL: "Belgium" #NT!
 objective_thriving_culture_desc_BEL: "Belgium is not only an aspiring economic power, but also has all sorts of options to flourish in the scientific field: in paleontology, astronomy, but also through Pacific expeditions, the small country could consolidate its world fame, which others acquire through war. Is the Congo just a colony, or the destination of a botanical expedition? And is Brussels just a transit area for traveling composers, or will the country try to establish its own musical tradition?" #NT!
 objective_thriving_culture_name_SAR: "Sardinia-Piemont" #NT!
 objective_thriving_culture_desc_SAR: "Sardinia-Piedmont finds itself in a tricky situation: on the one hand, can it muster its political and military forces to unite the Italian nation - and on the other hand live up to the reputation of being an Italian cultural nation? A united Italy would have new opportunities, from the construction of the Mole Antonelliana and musical successes to flight records at the Schneider Trophy." #NT!
 objective_thriving_culture_name_SWI: "Switzerland" #NT!
 objective_thriving_culture_desc_SWI: "As a landlocked country, Switzerland may be worse off when it comes to expeditions to far-flung places, but it has significant potential within its borders. Clever decisions in the promotion of classical music enable the Alpine state to motivate possibly one of the great composers to stay. A formation is useful for paleontology. And then there is always the project of the century contemplated by Alfred Escher: a huge tunnel through the middle of the mountains..." #NT!

Over the course of a hundred years, not only science as such, but also people's view of the world has changed significantly.

 je_mr_archaeology: "Archaeology" #NT!
 je_mr_archaeology_reason: "The 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a rapid development in the field of antiquity research: from treasure digging to serious science. The excavation of Troy by Heinrich Schliemann and the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen by Howard Carter are just two of the most famous highlights of this era. At the same time, they show that not only scientific thirst, but also national prestige played an important role in recovering valuable artifacts. With the (almost) complete decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphs by Karl Richard Lepsius in 1837, this new era was to begin." #NT!

 mr_babylonia_expedition_button_desc: "Babylonia, the southern part of Mesopotamia, owes its name to the once powerful city of Babylon.

 mr_assyria_expedition_button: "The Gardens of Assyria" #NT!

 mr_argolis_expedition_button: "Agamemnon's city" #NT!
 mr_argolis_expedition_button_desc: "After the discovery of Troy, even skeptical scientists come to realize that the myths of the ancient Greeks are more than just fairy tales.

 mr_santa_cecilia_button_desc: "The Accademia di Santa Cecilia was founded by the papal bull 'Ratione congruit' by Sixtus V in 1585 in the form of a congregation. In 1838 the Congregation of Saint Cecilia was officially named an Academy and then the Pontifical Academy. Its members at that time included Luigi Cherubini, Mercadante, Donizetti, Rossini, Paganini, Auber, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Berlioz, Gounod and Meyerbeer. One of its honorary members was Queen Victoria. In united Italy it developed into a leading conservatory." #NT!

 mr_leipzig_conservatory_button_desc: "The traditional music city of Leipzig, where Johann Sebastian Bach was already active, offered optimal conditions for the founding of a musical and academic talent factory at the beginning of the 19th century. Four committed citizens of the city, namely the lawyer Heinrich Conrad Schleinitz (second director), the district director of Leipzig Johann Paul von Falkenstein and the Royal Saxon Court Councilor Johann Georg Keil as well as the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy put the previous ideas into practice." #NT!

 mr_petrograd_conservatory_button_desc: "On the initiative of the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, Anton Rubinstein, Andrei Nikolayevich Markovich and other personalities of society and musical life, the Russian Music Society was founded, from whose music classes the first conservatory in Russia was founded. Anton Rubinstein was the first director of the conservatory and professor of piano. The first graduate to complete his composition studies here was Peter Tchaikovsky. Nikolai Andreyevich Rimsky-Korsakov had a particularly influential role as professor of composition and instrumentation and head of the orchestra class." #NT!

 mr_concertgebouw_button_desc: "The Concertgebouw is the most famous concert hall in Amsterdam and home to the Concertgebouw Orchestra. The Netherlands had long lagged behind the rest of musical development on the continent, but the Concertgebouw ensured that Amsterdam soon ranked among the top European music capitals. This was also due to the high quality offered by the Concertgebouw Orchestra, especially under the direction of their future conductor Willem Mengelberg." #NT!

 mr_the_proms_button_desc: "The Proms is an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music concerts and other events held annually. Prom is short for promenade concert, a term which originally referred to outdoor concerts in London's pleasure gardens. The season is a significant event in British culture and in classical music. Many people's perception of the Proms is based on the Last Night, although this is very different from the other concerts." #NT!
