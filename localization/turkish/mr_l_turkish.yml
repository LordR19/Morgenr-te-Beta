 objective_thriving_culture_desc: "Any barbaric country can conquer a patch of earth. But higher civilization shows itself in the realm of science and culture. Uncover archeological treasures, discover new stars and planets, hire composers, collect exotic animals and plants, embark on research trips or set records in the aviation age. A new morning dawns!" #NT!
  
 objective_thriving_culture_name_AUS: "Austria" #NT!
 objective_thriving_culture_desc_AUS: "Bella gerant alii, tu felix Austria nube! Are these times over for Austria? The Congress of Vienna and Metternich pushed Austria one last time into the central position of Europe, but the ambitions of Prussia and Russia threaten the compromise-oriented policy of the Habsburg Empire. As in the past, can Austria triumph in the future by becoming a center of attraction for culture and lifestyle? Defend Vienna's reputation as a music metropolis and develop it into the most attractive city in Europe." #NT!

 objective_thriving_culture_desc_BEL: "Belgium is not only an aspiring economic power, but also has all sorts of options to flourish in the scientific field: in paleontology, astronomy, but also through Pacific expeditions, the small country could consolidate its world fame, which others acquire through war. Is the Congo just a colony, or the destination of a botanical expedition? And is Brussels just a transit area for traveling composers, or will the country try to establish its own musical tradition?" #NT!

 objective_thriving_culture_desc_SAR: "Sardinia-Piedmont finds itself in a tricky situation: on the one hand, can it muster its political and military forces to unite the Italian nation - and on the other hand live up to the reputation of being an Italian cultural nation? A united Italy would have new opportunities, from the construction of the Mole Antonelliana and musical successes to flight records at the Schneider Trophy." #NT!
 objective_thriving_culture_name_SWI: "Switzerland" #NT!
 objective_thriving_culture_desc_SWI: "As a landlocked country, Switzerland may be worse off when it comes to expeditions to far-flung places, but it has significant potential within its borders. Clever decisions in the promotion of classical music enable the Alpine state to motivate possibly one of the great composers to stay. A formation is useful for paleontology. And then there is always the project of the century contemplated by Alfred Escher: a huge tunnel through the middle of the mountains..." #NT!

It was founded mainly on the initiative of the aeronaut and later general secretary of the society, Walther Bruns. The founding president in 1924 was Fridtjof Nansen. After several years of preparatory work, the company succeeded in 1931 in using an airship for a purely scientific polar expedition for the first time. Through the Arctic flight of the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, knowledge of the geography of the polar regions flown over was significantly expanded. As early as 1926 Umberto Nobile flew over the North Pole with his airship 'Norge' and later undertook an expedition with the 'Italia'." #NT!

Over the course of a hundred years, not only science as such, but also people's view of the world has changed significantly. The theory of evolution has shaken man's certainty just as much as the theory of relativity.

 mr_exodus_congress_button_desc: "With the increased research into Egypt and the Levant, the question of the historicity of the biblical events arises again. In particular, the non-mention of the Exodus, i.e. the departure of the Hebrews from Egypt, has raised the question of whether the Five Books of Moses are not just mere inventions.

But with the daily increase in finds from Assyria and Babylonia, this theory has been clearly shaken. Rather, it turns out that writing was apparently invented in Mesopotamia - as were many other achievements that accompanied the beginning of civilization. Is it perhaps the case that every civilization ultimately emerged from Babylon - and every form of religion derives from Babylonian myths?

 mr_asteroid_congress_button_desc: "Since the discovery of Ceres in 1801, astronomers have found more and more celestial bodies, which is why the number of planets in the solar system has continued to increase. The discovery of Neptune raised the question of whether a new category might make more sense for the numerous, smaller objects found particularly between Mars and Jupiter. In particular, the invention of new astronomical symbols and their relatively small size led astronomers to assume that they were more likely 'small stars' or 'small planets'. Of course, this categorization would mean that some of the objects previously considered planets would lose their status and would be degraded to mere boulders." #NT!

As a result of the Astrographic Congress of more than 50 astronomers held in Paris in April 1887, 20 observatories from around the world agreed to participate in the project.

It revolved around the size of the Milky Way and whether the galaxies then known as spiral nebulae are small objects in the Milky Way or much more distant and separate from the Milky Way. That day, the two scientists presented independent technical papers on the size scale of the Universe, followed by a public discussion in the evening.

The excavation of Troy by Heinrich Schliemann and the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen by Howard Carter are just two of the most famous highlights of this era. At the same time, they show that not only scientific thirst, but also national prestige played an important role in recovering valuable artifacts.

 je_mr_arts_reason: "People do not live by bread alone, and the promotion of the fine arts is not a decadent form of waste of money, but has always been a flagship in the competition between the great powers. Germany and Italy's musical cultures inspired and influenced the world before these nation states existed; and Austria, despite its weakened political power position, still played an important role due to artistic impulses. Even smaller nations were able to make themselves larger than they were politically because of their cultural influence." #NT!

 mr_beethoven_monument_button_desc: "There is no doubt that Ludwig van Beethoven was the greatest composer of all time and that all romantic music is an outgrowth of his work. Every contemporary artist owes him a tribute. It is all the more astonishing that he is still far too little appreciated. After an appeal by Robert Schumann, however, several associations, cities, princes and governments collected money to erect a memorial in his birthplace Bonn." #NT!

The ADMV aimed at both musical performance and practical support. As part of the artistic aims of the ADMV, annual Tonkünstler-Versammlungen at different locations were to be arranged, with performances of important, rarely heard, and especially new musical works of all kinds. However, older works that were only seldom or not at all heard, but of interest because of their importance, were also to be performed." #NT!
