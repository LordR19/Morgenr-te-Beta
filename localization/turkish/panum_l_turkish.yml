Tuberculosis gained widespread interest in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the endemic disease of the urban poor. In 1815 a quarter of deaths in England and in 1918 in France a sixth of deaths were caused by tuberculosis.

From there they may have been brought to India by Egyptian traders. The European conquerors brought smallpox with them to America, where it caused devastating epidemics among the Indians starting in 1518, causing millions of deaths. In Europe, smallpox was sometimes considered a childhood disease, and the disease, from which up to 10% of all small children died until the end of the 18th century, was also called “children's disease”. From the 18th century onwards, cases of smallpox increased and replaced the plague as the worst disease. It is estimated that 400,000 people died of smallpox each year, and a third of those who survived went blind. Often children were only considered part of the family once they had survived smallpox.

Typhus became a serious problem for Napoleon's army during the Russian campaign. When the Grande Armée, which had moved to Russia in June 1812, withdrew in the fall of 1813, Mainz was the first stop on French soil. 15,000-17,000 French crew and just as many civilians died there. The disease, which was then also called “nervous fever” because of the neurological symptoms it caused, remained in the French language as Typhus de Mayence. By the end of October 1814, 14,000 cases of typhus had been recorded in the Franconian area around the Grand Duchy of Würzburg, of which 2,500 were fatal.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Central America, the Caribbean and the south of what is now the USA were also affected. The disease probably originated in Africa and reached the New World via the Atlantic triangular trade. The first probable outbreak of the disease occurred in Yucatan in 1648, where the disease was referred to as xekik (black vomit). At least 25 major outbreaks followed, such as in Philadelphia in 1793, in which several thousand people died and the American government and then President George Washington were forced to leave the city. One of the earliest medical descriptions of yellow fever in North America was by John Lining (1756), a physician in Charleston, where yellow fever occurred in 1728 and 1732. Occasional outbreaks were also recorded in Europe, for example in Barcelona in 1821 with several thousand deaths. In 1867 there was an eruption at Fort Jefferson in Florida.

 panum.202.d: "Despite all medical examinations, the origin of tuberculosis still remains a controversial area. Some of our medical staff assume that this is a hereditary disease, or at least one based on 'internal factors'. Other doctors are of the opinion that it is a classic, contagious disease and recommend radical measures." #NT!
 panum.202.f: "Regarding the concept of pathogenesis, different traditions existed in the European countries of the 18th and 19th centuries. Many medical authors of that time considered tuberculosis, or consumption, which was not always synonymous with it, to be the worst of the epidemics known at the time. They saw the causes as an unequal distribution of bodily humors, ominous exhalations from the soil, urbanization or the decline of customs. In Italy, on the other hand, there was a traditional tendency towards a contagious, i.e. h. transmittable cause. Consequently, in the middle of the 18th century, the Republic of Venice introduced the written obligation to report cases of phthisis (consumption due to pulmonary tuberculosis). The personal belongings of those who died of the disease were burned to reduce the risk of infection. In England and the Nordic countries, however, it was generally believed that the disease was due to a hereditary cause." #NT!

Those who assumed a contagious cause advocated radical bans - including spitting in public areas - to prevent the spread. This particularly affected the lower classes. Skeptics saw such regulations as just a way to harass ordinary people." #NT!
 panum.203.f: "Even if the rules of etiquette of the 18th century eradicated some 'bad habits' in the upper and middle classes, many hygienically dubious quirks remained widespread among the masses for a long time. Handkerchiefs and spittoons had not yet become widespread in society at the beginning of the 19th century, and it was only around the turn of the century that it became common practice to ban spitting on public transport, for example." #NT!

 panum.204.f: "At the beginning of the 19th century, but also well beyond, tuberculosis was considered a 'romantic disease'. It gave the victim enough time to prepare for death, and many saw the associated pallor as nothing short of noble. Writers created monuments to her with several works, such as Dumas the Younger with the 'Lady of the Camellias'. She finds similar transfiguration in the operas of Verdi (La Traviata) and Puccini (La Bohème). George Sand, Chopin's partner, is said to have noted: 'Chopin coughs with infinite grace.'" #NT!

 panum.205.d: "In view of the tuberculosis epidemic raging in [SCOPE.sState('panum_disease_state').GetName], one of the doctors there has suggested that some wealthy patients be transferred to the mountains. The high altitude climate and the cleansing air are said to cure them of the disease. There should be a dedicated pulmonary sanatorium for this purpose. [SCOPE.sState('panum_davos_scope').GetName] seems to be the perfect place for such a sanatorium." #NT!
 panum.205.f: "The air cure is a form of climatic therapy that was considered the standard therapy for tuberculosis for a long time from the 19th century onwards. The patients lay on deck chairs outdoors or in open lounges for several hours a day. The air treatment was carried out in special pulmonary sanatoriums. In Germany, the doctor Hermann Brehmer was the first to describe the previously incurable disease tuberculosis as curable with the help of air therapy. In 1856 he wrote his dissertation on the curability of chronic tuberculosis of the lungs. He assumed that there are 'immune places' that, on the one hand, due to their climate, effectively protect the residents from the occurrence of tuberculosis and, on the other hand, have a healing effect after the disease breaks out. In Switzerland, the German-born doctor Alexander Spengler was a pioneer of air therapy. He began practicing as a country doctor in Davos in 1853 and soon came to the conclusion that the residents of the area generally did not suffer from tuberculosis, which he attributed to the high mountain climate. Thomas Mann glorified Davos as a climatic health resort in his 'Zauberberg'." #NT!

 panum.402.d: "Given the limited knowledge of what typhus is, what causes it and how to effectively combat it, there are numerous theories as to what promotes infection. The prevailing view is that it is a disease related to lifestyle, not transmission." #NT!
 panum.402.f: "Similar to tuberculosis, there were many doctors who assumed that typhus was not a contagious disease. While tuberculosis was viewed in an almost romanticized way - it was a disease of the romantics and therefore 'noble' spirits - in the case of typhus the sickness was seen as a stigma of moral disrepute. The fact that the higher classes were not affected led to a certain feeling of superiority. Just as in the Middle Ages illnesses were often attributed to divine influence or punishment, it seemed to be a proven fact that character defects or depravity were to some extent linked to certain illnesses. It was only from the second third of the 19th century onwards that this view began to change." #NT!

Some members of the government, on the other hand, want a complete quarantine, which the middle class in particular considers to be a completely excessive measure." #NT!
 panum.403.f: "Like many other epidemics, typhus served to segregate. The call for a general quarantine was therefore unpopular in many places because it was believed that certain people could be attributed to illness, especially since many believed it to be hereditary. However, the underlying fear of infection played a role, which is why fever houses were built in many places. During the great typhus epidemic in North America in 1847, the idea that it was a contagious disease became so widespread that masses of infected Irish immigrants were de facto deported to such institutions." #NT!

 panum.404.f: "Fever sheds were filthy and crowded, with patients lying in double tiers of bunks which allowed dirt from the top bunk to fall onto the lower. According to the Senate Committee's report, two or three invalids would be placed together in one berth, irrespective of age or sex. There was no bread: meals consisted of tea, gruel or broth served three times a day. As drinking water was carted, there was never enough for the fever patients. One Catholic priest, Father Moylan, reported giving water to invalids in a tent who had not been able to drink for 18 hours. The sheds were not originally intended to house fever patients and had no ventilation; new sheds were built without privies. The Senate Committee stated that because of the lack of personnel and space, the invalids lay in their own excrement for days and there were insufficient staff to take away those who died during the night." #NT!

As many as 900,000 deaths have been attributed to the typhus fever during the Crimean War in 1853-1856. Typhus was endemic in Poland and several neighboring countries prior to World War I (1914-1918), but became epidemic during the war. Typhus ravaged the armies of the Eastern Front, where over 150,000 died in Serbia alone.
