 verrier_physics_tech_desc: "Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics. Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies (determined by Kepler between 1609 and 1619), Galileo's pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Isaac Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation (that would come to bear his name)." #NT!
 verrier_astronomy_tech: "Modern Astronomy" #NT!
 verrier_astronomy_tech_desc: "During the 18-19th centuries, the study of the three-body problem by Leonhard Euler, Alexis Claude Clairaut, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Pierre Simon Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations." #NT!

 verrier_electromagnetism_tech_desc: "In 1864 James Clerk Maxwell of Edinburgh announced his electromagnetic theory of light, which was perhaps the greatest single step in the world's knowledge of electricity. Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light obviously involved the existence of electric waves in free space, and his followers set themselves the task of experimentally demonstrating the truth of the theory. The discovery of electromagnetic waves in space led to the development of radio in the closing years of the 19th century." #NT!

 verrier_astro_physics_tech_desc: "Modern physics is a branch of physics that developed in the early 20th century. Notable branches of modern physics include quantum mechanics, special relativity and general relativity. It is concerned with extreme conditions, such as high velocities that are comparable to the speed of light, small distances comparable to the atomic radius, and very high energies." #NT!

 verrier_chemistry_tech_desc: "The development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by Alessandro Volta. ritish William Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. J.A.R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements." #NT!
  
 je_verrier_neptune: "The Unknown Planet" #NT!
 je_verrier_neptune_reason: "In 1821, Alexis Bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus, making predictions of future positions based on Newton's laws of motion and gravitation. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesize some perturbing body. These irregularities, both in the planet's ecliptic longitude and in its radius vector (its distance from the Sun), could have been explained by several hypotheses: the effect of the Sun's gravity at such a great distance might differ from Newton's description; or the discrepancies might simply be observational error; or perhaps Uranus was being pulled, or perturbed, by an undiscovered planet. John Couch Adams learned of these irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the perturbation hypothesis. Adams believed that he could use the observed data on Uranus and Newton's law of gravitation to deduce the mass, position, and orbit of the perturbing body. Meanwhile, on 10 November 1845, Urbain Le Verrier presented to the Académie des sciences in Paris a memoir on Uranus and showed that the pre-existing theory failed to account for its motion. Unaware of Adams's work, he attempted a similar investigation, and on 1 June 1846, in a second memoir presented to a public meeting of the Académie, he gave the position, but not the mass or orbit, of the proposed perturbing body. Le Verrier located the unknown planet within one degree of its discovery position. Le Verrier was unaware that his public confirmation of Adams' private computations had set in motion a British search for the purported planet. On 31 August, Le Verrier presented a third memoir, now giving the mass and orbit of the new body. Now it was only a matter of finding the celestial body and thereby proving its existence." #NT!

 je_verrier_pluto_reason: "In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune. In 1906, Percival Lowell - a wealthy Bostonian who had founded Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894 - started an extensive project in search of a possible unknown planet, which he termed 'Planet X'. By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet. Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Planet X on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were. Percival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929. Vesto Melvin Slipher, the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old Clyde Tombaugh, who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings. Tombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates." #NT!

 je_verrier_charter_moon_reason: "Selenography is the study of the surface and physical features of the Moon (also known as geography of the Moon, or selenodesy). Like geography and areography, selenography is a subdiscipline within the field of planetary science. Historically, the principal concern of selenographists was the mapping and naming of the lunar terrane identifying maria, craters, mountain ranges, and other various features. Lunar mapping became systematic in 1779 when Johann Schröter began meticulous observation and measurement of lunar topography. In 1834 Johann Heinrich von Mädler published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published The Universal Selenography. All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when J.W. Draper, using a 5 inch reflector, produced a daguerreotype of the Moon and thus introduced photography to astronomy. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the telescope 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of astronomy." #NT!

 verrier_asteroid_congress_decision_desc: "Since the discovery of Ceres in 1801, astronomers have found more and more celestial bodies, which is why the number of planets in the solar system has continued to increase. The discovery of Neptune raised the question of whether a new category might make more sense for the numerous, smaller objects found particularly between Mars and Jupiter. In particular, the invention of new astronomical symbols and their relatively small size led astronomers to assume that they were more likely 'small stars' or 'small planets'. Of course, this categorization would mean that some of the objects previously considered planets would lose their status and would be degraded to mere boulders." #NT!

That day, the two scientists presented independent technical papers on the size scale of the Universe, followed by a public discussion in the evening.

These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the Earth's surface. Very intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which produce at least 1,000 meteors an hour, most notably from the Leonids." #NT!

He noted 'a little cloud' where the Andromeda Galaxy is located. From 1751 to 1753, Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille cataloged 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope, most of which were previously unknown. The number of nebulae was then greatly increased by the efforts of William Herschel and his sister Caroline Herschel, whoroughly 2,000 nebulae. Beginning in 1864, William Huggins examined the spectra of about 70 nebulae. About 1923, following the Great Debate, it had become clear that many 'nebulae' were in fact galaxies far from the Milky Way." #NT!

Saturn has 83 moons with confirmed orbits that are not embedded in its rings. as well as dense rings that contain millions of embedded moonlets and innumerable smaller ring particles. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those, Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Particularly notable among Saturn's moons is Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede." #NT!

 verrier.50.f: "Lunar mapping became systematic in 1779 when Johann Schröter began meticulous observation and measurement of lunar topography. In 1834 Johann Heinrich von Mädler published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published The Universal Selenography. All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when J.W. Draper, using a 5 inch reflector, produced a daguerreotype of the Moon and thus introduced photography to astronomy. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the telescope 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of astronomy." #NT!

 verrier.51.d: "The project to map the moon photographically has made progress." #NT!
 verrier.51.f: "Rille is typically used to describe any of the long, narrow depressions in the surface of the Moon that resemble channels. The Latin term is rima, plural rimae. Typically, a rille can be several kilometers wide and hundreds of kilometers in length. However, the term has also been used loosely to describe similar structures on a number of planets in the Solar System, including Mars, Venus, and on a number of moons. All bear a structural resemblance to each other." #NT!
 verrier.51.g: "Fascinating." #NT!
 verrier.52.t: "Lunar crater" #NT!
 verrier.52.f: "The cratering records of very old surfaces - such as the Moon - record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago. Because the processes of erosion on the Moon are minimal, craters persist. In 1893, Grove Karl Gilbert suggested for the first time that the Moon's craters were formed by large asteroid impacts." #NT!
 verrier.53.t: "Lunar maria" #NT!
 verrier.53.f: "The lunar maria are large, dark, basaltic plains on Earth's Moon, formed by ancient asteroid impacts on the far side on the Moon that triggered volcanic activity on the opposite (near) side. They were dubbed maria, Latin for 'seas', by early astronomers who mistook them for actual seas. They are less reflective than the "highlands" as a result of their iron-rich composition, and hence appear dark to the naked eye. The maria cover about 16% of the lunar surface, mostly on the side visible from Earth. The few maria on the far side are much smaller, residing mostly in very large craters. The traditional nomenclature for the Moon also includes one oceanus (ocean), as well as features with the names lacus ('lake'), palus ('marsh'), and sinus ('bay'). The last three are smaller than maria, but have the same nature and characteristics." #NT!
 verrier.54.t: "Lunar highlands" #NT!
 verrier.54.f: "The lighter-colored regions of the Moon are called terrae, or more commonly highlands, because they are higher than most maria. They have been dated to having formed 4.4 billion years ago, and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean. The concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after the Moon's formation." #NT!

It was a member of the Kreutz Sungrazers, a family of comets resulting from the breakup of a parent comet into multiple fragments in about 1106. These comets pass extremely close to the surface of the Sun - within a few solar radii - and often become very bright as a result. It passed closest to Earth on March 6, 1843, and was at its greatest brilliance the following day; unfortunately for observers north of the equator, at its peak it was best visible from the Southern Hemisphere.

It remained a naked-eye object until November for Southern Hemisphere observers. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful comets observed, and was one of the brightest of the century, making a strong impression both on artists and the general public. After a prior period of hysteria on the subject of comets, especially in Paris (caused partly by incorrect calculations by John Russell Hind which suggested that one would strike the Earth in June 1857) it went on to be the most-observed of the century due to its excellent visibility in dark skies for Northern Hemisphere viewers, particularly in Europe, and fine weather in September and October. William Henry Smyth, an English astronomer, recalled it as 'one of the most beautiful objects that I have ever seen'.

In my marine telescope the object appeared much diffused, and it was with the greatest difficulty that I estimated its distance from three well known fixed stars. The object was hardly distinguishable in the small telescope attached to the sextant, and I found it necessary to employ a coloured glass between the index and horizon glasses, for the superior brilliance of the reference stars Procyon, Sirius, and Canopus, when they were brought into the field of view, quite extinguished its feeble light. Every comet hunter knows how necessary it is to the carrying out of his work to have at hand a copious catalogue of nebulae, but this valuable adjunct I unfortunately did not possess. I could not, however, find the object in the limited catalogues at my command.

Curtis, on the other hand, contended that Andromeda and other such 'nebulae' were separate galaxies, or 'island universes' (a term invented by the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant, who also believed that the 'spiral nebulae' were extragalactic). He showed that there were more novae in Andromeda than in the Milky Way. From this, he could ask why there were more novae in one small section of the galaxy than the other sections of the galaxy, if Andromeda were not a separate galaxy but simply a nebula within Earth's galaxy.

The fourth, a consequence of the theory of special relativity, developed the principle of mass-energy equivalence, expressed in the famous equation E = mc^2 and which led to the discovery and use of atomic energy. These four papers, together with quantum mechanics and Einstein's later theory of general relativity, are the foundation of modern physics." #NT!

Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year.  In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life.  In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, as a Jew, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government; he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940." #NT!

 verrier.93.f: "General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. Einstein's theory has astrophysical implications, including the prediction of black holes - regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. Black holes are the end-state for massive stars. Microquasars and active galactic nuclei are believed to be stellar black holes and supermassive black holes. It also predicts gravitational lensing, where the bending of light results in multiple images of the same distant astronomical phenomenon." #NT!

As a result of this discovery, the comet is named after Halley. The 1910 approach was notable for several reasons: it was the first approach of which photographs exist, and the first for which spectroscopic data were obtained. American satirist and writer Mark Twain was born on 30 November 1835, exactly two weeks after the comet's perihelion.

This assumption, incompatible with classical physics, is regarded as the birth of quantum physics and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of Planck's career. The discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units, all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based.

Using the Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson, Hubble identified Cepheid variables, a standard candle discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. Comparing their apparent luminosity to their intrinsic luminosity gives their distance from Earth. Hubble found Cephieds in several nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum Nebula. His observations, made in 1924, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside our own, thus today they are no longer considered nebula.

It is the basis for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry he was awarded in 1908 'for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances'. Rutherford moved to the UK, where he and Thomas Royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. Later he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden.

It was published in two volumes between 1868 and 1870, and Mendeleev wrote it as he was preparing a textbook for his course. As he attempted to classify the elements according to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led him to postulate his periodic table; he claimed to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream: 'I saw in a dream a table where all elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper, only in one place did a correction later seem necessary.'

Galle found Neptune in the same night he received Le Verrier's letter, within 1° of the predicted position. After that Le Verrier took on the task to '... embrace in a single work the entire planetary system, put everything in harmony if possible, otherwise, declare with certainty that there are as yet unknown causes of perturbations...', a work which would occupy him for the rest of his life. Le Verrier began by re-evaluating, to the 7th order, the technique of calculating the planetary perturbations known as the perturbing function. This derivation, which resulted in 469 mathematical terms, was complete by 1849. He next collected observations of the positions of the planets as far back as 1750.

The Zurich number, invented by the first director of the Sternwarte, Rudolf Wolf, is a way to measure the amount of sunspots and to estimate the activity of the sun. With the number it was actually possible to use data that was gathered since 1610 and calculate the historic sun activity.\n   After the Cantonal Hospital was built close to the Sternwarte in 1945 observing the night sky became limited. The observation was stopped in 1980. Today the former observatory houses the Collegium Helveticum of the Eidgenössisch Technische Hochschule. The Collegium is an interdisiplinary research institute.

 verrier.142.d: "While observing solar flares, [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('verrier_astronomer_var').GetCharacter.GetFullName] noticed a highly unusual phenomenon. If his theory is correct, then a solar storm is racing toward Earth. On the one hand, this is a sensation of groundbreaking scientific significance. However, it could also be dangerous." #NT!
 verrier.142.f: "A solar flare is a structure of increased radiation within the Sun's chromosphere that is powered by magnetic field energy. An absorption spectrum of a flare region typically shows helium and calcium in addition to hydrogen. The areas emit increased short-wave radiation in the ultraviolet and X-ray ranges as well as protons, electrons and ions. On Earth, this causes disturbances in the ionosphere with corresponding impairments in radio traffic. When the particles enter the Earth's atmosphere, they cause magnetic storms. Ionospheric storms occur when particles slowly penetrating the aurora zones cause the auroras to be visible at night and strongly fluctuating electrical currents cause geomagnetic disturbances." #NT!

 verrier.143.f: "From August 28 to September 4, 1859, several powerful solar flares occurred, observed in particular by the astronomer Richard Carrington. The material ejected from the coronal mass ejections had a speed of over 2000 km/s. This reached Earth about 17.5 hours later. The most powerful geomagnetic storm to date was recorded on the night of September 1st to 2nd. Auroras were seen around the world in both northern and southern hemispheres. The aurora over the Rocky Mountains in the United States was so bright that the glow woke gold miners, who began preparing breakfast because they thought it was morning. People in the northeastern United States could read a newspaper by the aurora's light. The aurora was visible from the poles to low latitude areas such as south-central Mexico, Cuba, Hawaii, Queensland, southern Japan and China, and even at lower latitudes very close to the equator, such as in Colombia." #NT!

Some operators were able to continue to send and receive messages despite having disconnected their power supplies." #NT!

It is now disconnected.'\nBoston: 'Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?'\nPortland: 'Better than with our batteries on. Current comes and goes gradually.'\nBoston: 'My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble.'\nPortland: 'Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?'\nBoston: 'Yes. Go ahead.'" #NT!
