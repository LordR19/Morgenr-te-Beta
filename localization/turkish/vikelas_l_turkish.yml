Baseball was initially concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, but soon expanded to the West Coast; For the most part, interest in the Southern States and the Rocky Mountains has only emerged in the last few decades.

The decisive factor for this was soldiers who played the game in military camps during the American Civil War and thus ensured that the sport became more widespread. In 1857, the first American baseball association, the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP), was founded. By 1867, more than 400 clubs had joined the association. However, the strongest teams were still located in the northeastern United States, particularly in New York.

However, it would take over 30 years for the sport to become more professional. Baseball was also popularized in Cuba by Nemesio Guillot, who founded the first major baseball club in the country. It became the most played sport in the country in the 1870s, before the period of American intervention.

In 1925, at the instigation of the Automobile Club of Italy, the introduction of an official world championship was finally announced.

 vikelas.501.f: "As early as the mid-1890s, the Automobile Club de France (ACF), founded in 1895 as the first automobile club in the world, organized a race once a year, which represented the highlight of the season. These were so-called 'city-to-city' races on public country roads, in which the participants were sent out individually at intervals. One of the triggers for the founding of the ACF was Albert de Dion's relegation from the Paris-Rouen race in 1894. In the following years, rapid development began, with ever more powerful vehicles greatly increasing the dangers of motorsport. The ACF therefore implemented rules for the first time in 1901, which can be considered the first motorsport regulations in the world. A central innovation was the division into categories that had to apply to all events supported by the ACF. The resulting weight limitation should initially help to reduce the immense number of tire defects due to overloading." #NT!

In view of constantly increasing speeds, in 1902 the ACF issued technical regulations for the first time in the form of a so-called racing formula, which the participating cars had to adhere to. Nevertheless, the frequency of accidents continued to increase, so that from 1903 only circuit races could be held on closed courses. As the successor to the Gordon Bennett races, the main race organized by the ACF ran for the first time in 1906 under the name Grand Prix.
